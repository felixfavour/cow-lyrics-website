Jesus, lover of my soul
Jesus, I will never let You go
You've taken me from the miry clay
You've set my feet upon the rock
Now I know
I love You, I need You
Though my world may fall, I'll never let You go
My Saviour, my closest friend
I will worship You until the very end
Jesus, lover of my soul
Jesus, I will never let You go
You've taken me from the miry clay
You've set my feet upon the rock
Now I know
I love You, I need You
Though my world may fall, I'll never let You go
My Saviour, my closest friend
I will worship You until the very end
