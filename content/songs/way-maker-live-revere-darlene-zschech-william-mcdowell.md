You are here, moving in our midst
I worship You, I worship You
You are here, working in this place
'N I worship You, I worship You
[Chorus: Darlene Zschech]
You are
Way maker, miracle worker
Promise keeper, light in the darkness
My God, that is who You are
Forever
Way maker, miracle worker
Promise keeper, light in the darkness
My God, that is who You are
You are here, touching every heart
And I worship You, oh God, I worship You
You are here, and You are healing every heart
I worship You, I worship
You are here (You are here)
And You are turning lives (Turning lives around)
Yes, You are
I worship You (I worship You)
Oh (I worship You)
You are here (You are here)
And You are mending every heart (Mending every heart)
And I worship You (I worship You)
I worship You
