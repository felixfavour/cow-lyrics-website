ave am
All praise to the Lord. Give am
God no Dey like the flesh. Kill am
I Dey bring my cup. Fill am, fill am
Leave am
All praise to the Lord. Give am
God no Dey like the flesh. Kill am, kill am kill am
I Dey bring my cup. Fill am
Leave am
All your sorrows, give am
Why? lets review am
God showed you His Love
And use him Son reveal am
When He hung Him up on that cross
Your price was paid, dey bill am
Now the Father calls you His own
And he use Hin Spirit seal am
This infilling of the Holy Spirit
Got me really thinking that im drunk to
Tongue speaking when I come through
Lemme introduce you to the truth
You clearly wonder why I do this
So listen close to the answer
I serve a lamb that's Leo
Then spread the gospel like cancer
I run this race like tomorrow no de
When the Devil try me I just tell am no way
I de face my God Call me Looku looku
You should look it up its a song by Bode
I aint worried bout any bagger tryna get in my way
Cuz one day my Lord will come in style kinda like Ariana,  Grande
Rugged you
Straight to the old rugged cross
There you bled and then paid the dues
You went down and you took the keys
And told them that you changed the rules
You say anybody weh believe in you
Go de collect awuf
Na you weh de run my parole
Everybody don de talk say na wayo
Even if I no de contribute
I de still collect akawo
Bad man don Dey fear my shadow
Me bring down every macho
The only time wey pesin fit touch my head
Na when dem Dey run me shampoo
Leave am
Na you play my song so I know say Nobody
Go fit to wheel am
So let your you will be
And when e done an you go dish am
He get one bird weh fly pass me now
Na you de feed am
Leave am
All praise to the Lord. Give am
God no Dey like the flesh. Kill am
I Dey bring my cup. Fill am
God in me as me that's quote for life
That's my boy CHIDI
Shout out to the day 1 fellas
Shout outs to the ones wey dey rep my city
Man dem know I'm stunting when I come through somersault "TAKITI"
Pull up with the gang my guys wey dey come from sky we Dey cut your BP
Round on round I take them pound for pound in confrontations
Two knees down when I wrestle
I don't need guns I don't need no cape on
Chef with the hard man flow
If you bring beef everywhere don stew now
Three boys thrown in the fire
I'm with the fourth that's 2 plus 2 now
Wavy guy with the ocean flow y'all smallies still river banking
I'm with the all time high
Y'all better miss me with that skunking
Puff puff pass don't work for me
Everything I need God done for me
Y'all cannot fill in my shoes
I don't mince words when I tell them
Leave am
See the Lord be my portion
When my boat is stuck in the desert
See the Lord be my ocean
He make a way
where there is no way
Julius Berger in motion
He set my feet upon solid rock
Now I'm bullet proof from erosion
All because He die for me
I'm one with the Son,
Im one with the Lord
The Spirit's alive in me
Got 70 foot angelic soldiers
that be ready to ride for me
And when the enemy try to test my God
Owo Jesu ma Jaa won sii
Leave am
All praise to the Lord. Give am
God no Dey like the flesh. Kill am
I Dey bring my cup. Fill am
Leave am
All praise to the Lord. Give am
God no Dey like the flesh. Kill am
I Dey bring my cup. Fill am
Take am or leave am
Praise is beyond feelings
No try feel am
Flesh! Kill am!
Live by the Spirit
My guy, no try force am
Your cup! Bring am!
Even if na booter
You see, God fit fill am
Leave am! LEAVE AM!
