Lord you know
I couldn't do so much on my own
But now when I do some things
They just glow
Because you taught me everything I know
Yea
Lord you know
I wrote this song to let the whole world know
It doesn't matter what they do and how far they go
Ehh ehh
You are all we need
Chorus:
Cos
No better singer like you
There were no songs before you
Oh lord
There is no one like you, like you
There is no one like you
No better writer like you
They were no arts before you
Oh Lord
There is no one like you, like you
There is no one like you
Verse 2:
Hello (hello)
Hello there's no better coach than I am that I am
He's the one who gives the wisdom for higher yarns
If you want to be the greatest of all time
You better have a coach like mine
Oh lord you know
I wrote this song to let the whole world know
That they can be nothing on their o-w-n
You are all we need
Chorus:
No better rapper like you
Yeah
They were no songs before you
Oh lord
There is no one like you, like you
There is no one like you
No better dancer like you
There were no arts before you
Oh oh lord
There is no one like you, like you
There is no one like you
If you're hearing the sound of my voice
Then you should know this
God made only one of you
There's no singer like you
There's no writer like you
There is no one like you
There is no one like you
No one can do it like you
Hold what you have and stay true
There's no one like you
Yes there is no one like you
(speaking in tongues)
