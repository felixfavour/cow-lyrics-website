I will Dance before the King of my Heart
I will Dance before the King of my Heart
I am not ashamed to dance
He was never ashamed of me
When He came to give His life for me
I will Dance before the King of my Heart
I will Dance before the King of my Heart
I am not ashamed to dance
He was never ashamed of me
When He came to give His life for me
I will sing before the Love of my life
I will sing before the Love of my life
I am not ashamed to sing
He was never ashamed of me
When He came to pour His grace on me
I will sing before the Love of my life
I will sing before the Love of my life
I am not ashamed to sing
He was never ashamed of me
When He came to pour His grace on me
Oh, on the cross of Calvary
He lavished His love on me
Nothing I give (there's nothing I can give)
Will be enough (that will ever be enough)
To match His perfect sacrifice
