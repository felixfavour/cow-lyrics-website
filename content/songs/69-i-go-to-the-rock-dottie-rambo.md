Where do I go, when there′s nobody else to turn to?
Who do I talk to, when nobody wants to listen?
Who do I lean on, when there's no foundation stable?
I go to the Rock, I know He′s able, I go to the Rock.

I go to the Rock for my salvation,
I go to the stone that the builders rejected,
I run to the mountain, and the mountain stands by me.
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand,
On Christ, the Solid Rock, I stand,
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend, I go to the Rock.

Where do I hide, 'til the storms have all passed over?
Who do I run to, when the winds of sorrow threaten?
Is there a refuge in the time of tribulation?
When my soul needs consolation, I go to the Rock.

I go to the Rock for my salvation,
I go to the stone that the builders rejected,
I run to the mountain, and the mountain stands by me.
When the Earth all around me is sinking sand,
On Christ, the Solid Rock, I stand,
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend, I go to the Rock.
