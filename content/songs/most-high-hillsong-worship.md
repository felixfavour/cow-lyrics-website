I want to see Your face, I want to know Your ways
Let Your light shine upon us
I want to know Your power
Come fill me once again
And lift me up in Your hands of grace
[Pre-Chorus]
And put a new song in my mouth of praise to You
And the world will see and fear Your name
And put a new song in my mouth of praise to You
And the world will see and fear Your name
Worthy, worthy is the Lord
Worthy, worthy is the Lord
Worthy, worthy is the Lord, most high
I want to know Your power
Come fill me once again
And lift me up in Your hands of grace
[Pre-Chorus]
Put a new song in my mouth of praise to You
And the world will see and fear Your name
Put a new song in my mouth of praise to You
And the world will see and fear Your name
