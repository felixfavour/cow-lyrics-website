Through the calm and through the storm
Oh no, You never let go
In every high and every low
Oh no, You never let go

And fearful of the future and my lack of understanding
But it's funny 'cause even though I felt I was alone
I knew You were on the throne
I still spoke to You in whispers
Help me in this time of need
Really need Your wisdom
And I'll listen knowing that that even when I felt like You are distant it's like
