My momma gave me up when I was four years old
She didn't destroy my body but she killed my soul
Now it's cold â€˜cause I'm sleeping in my back seat
I understand the spirit's willing but my flesh is weak
Let him speak, let me speak
I never had a chance to dream
Ten years old and finding love in dirty magazines
Ms. December you remember I bought you twice
Now I'm thirty plus and still paying the price
Had a sister that I barely knew
Kind of got separated by the age of two
Same momma different daddy so we couldn't fake it
I saw my sister's daddy beat her in the tub naked
Take it serious the demons in a man's mind
The same man on rape charges now he's doing time
Crack followed and like daddy prison thirteen years
Haven't seen her, I guess she's traded tears for fears
[Hook]
Shout, Shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without so come on
Come on I'm talking to you, so come on
Sex was how I made it through
Without someone to teach you love what else is there to do
See where I'm from they call you gay
Say you ain't a man, show them you ain't no punk
Get all the girls you can, a simple plan that still haunts me even now today
Back to seventeen and got a baby on the way
No GED all I see is failure in my eyes, if you're listening and remember I apologize
