You still heal the sick
You still raise the dead
You still do amazing things
Na Your way, na Your way
You still hear our prayers
You still answer when we call
You always keep Your promise
Na Your way, na Your way
Na Your way, na Your way, na Your way
Na Your way, na Your way, na Your way
You're still moving mountains
With Your great and outstretched hands
You still do impossible things
Na Your normal way be that o
You've never lost a battle
You have never known defeat
And You handed us Your victory
Over sin, over death
Na Your way
Na Your way, na Your way, na Your way
Na Your way, na Your way, na Your way, O Jesus
Na Your way, na Your way, na Your way
Na Your way, na Your way, na Your way
Holy God, Eternal God
Righteous God, Unfailing God
From age to age o
You're still the same o
Faithful God, Consistent God
Mighty God, Sufficient God
From age to age o
You no dey change o
Holy God, Eternal God
Righteous God, Unfailing God
From age to age o (You no dey change o)
You're still the same o
Na Your way
You still bear our burdens
You still catch us when we fall
You still help our weakness
Na Your way, na Your way
You still show us mercy
Your compassion never ends
You have loved us with an everlasting love
Na Your way
Na Your way, na Your way, na Your way
Na Your way, na Your way, na Your way
Na Your way, na Your way, na Your way
Na Your way, na Your way, na Your way
Holy God, Eternal God
Righteous God, Unfailing God
You no dey change o
You're still the same o
From age to age o
Na Your way
