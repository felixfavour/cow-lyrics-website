You are gracious in majesty
You're the mighty and humble King
You have always been, You will always be
You were crowned with my sin and shame
You're enthroned in the highest praise
You have always been, You will always be
So we lift the cross, His banner over us
For the Lord, our God is ever glorious
And the heavens shout, declaring over us
That the Lord, our God, is ever glorious
You are constant forevermore
You're exalted and still adored
You have always been, You will always be
You surrendered in victory
You are risen to life in me
You have always been, You will always be
So we lift the cross, His banner over us
For the Lord, our God, is ever glorious
And the heavens shout, declaring over us
That the Lord, our God, is ever glorious
