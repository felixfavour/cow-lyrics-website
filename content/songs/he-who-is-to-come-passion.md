There is a day coming
When the old will pass away
Every wrong will be made right
No darkness, no night
The Son will light the way
There is a king coming
The one who conquered death and grave
No more pain and no more sorrow
This hope for tomorrow
Is our hope for today
[Pre-Chorus]
He who was
He who is
He who was
He who is
He who is to come
Christ the Son of Man
Riding on the clouds with a crown upon His head
Every eye will see Him
With the nail scars in His hands
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
