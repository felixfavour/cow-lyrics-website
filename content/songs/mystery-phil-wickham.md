Here in the quiet, speak to me now
My ears are open to Your gentle, sweet whispering
Break down the door, come inside
Shine down Your bright light
[Pre-Chorus]
I need a lamp for my feet
Yeah, I need a lamp for my feet
'Cause I wanna hear the thunder of who You are
To be captured inside the wonder of who You are
And I wanna live, I wanna breathe
To search out Your heart and all of Your mysteries
You were the first, and You'll be the end, time cannot hold You down
So, why save a wretch like me?
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause no eye has seen, no ear has heard
No heart could fully know all of Your mystery
Now, I wanna hear the thunder of who You are
To be captured inside the wonder of who You are
And I wanna live and I wanna breathe
To search out Your heart and all of Your mysteries
