I heard the bells on Christmas Day
Their old, familiar carols play
And wild and sweet
Their words repeat
Of peace on earth, good-will to men
And thought how, as the day had come
The steeples of all Christendom
Had rolled along
The unbroken song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men
I heard them ringing
I heard them ringing
All across the earth
I heard them ringing
The bells remember
They ring forever
Unto us a child is born our savior
Our savior
But in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong
And mocks the song
Of peace on earth, good-will to men
