Forever you will be the lamb upon the throne I gladly bow my knee and I worship you Lord 

Unto the Lamb upon the throne we raise a sound ,we raise a sound ,for he is God and God alone Hallelujah ,Hallelujah for he is worthy ,to receive all the glory and praise , unto the lamb upon the throne we raise a sound , we raise a sound 


Aka Aka Ya (The arm of the Lord) 
Aka Jehovah na’eme mma (The arm of the Lord does great things) 
Olu ebube ya (The display of His splendor) 
Nke na eruari na’ebem no (I see all around me) 
Isi iyi nke ndu (The stream of life) 
Nke na dighi ata’ta (That never runs dry) 
Aka aka ya (The arm of the Lord) 
Aka Jehovah na’eme mma (The arm of His strength does great things)
