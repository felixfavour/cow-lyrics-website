A Friday night affair
Out in the city heat
Always a party there
Along the sordid street
And it was guaranteed
The place to be was Rocketown
The drinks were two for one
Inside the crowded bars
The girls would make their run
Out on the boulevard
It was the idol place
We lived the ways of Rocketown
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hang around by the street light
In the heart of the night life
There came a certain man
A stranger to the crowd
We didn't understand
What he was all about
He walked a different pace
So out of place in Rocketown
