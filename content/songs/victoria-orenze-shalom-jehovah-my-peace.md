(Speaking in tongues)
We thank you holy spirit
 Thank you holy spirit
Through the fire
Through the raging storm
I will not lose my peace
Through the valley
through the sweeping floods
I will hold to my peace
nothing broken
nothing missing
you have it in control
nothing broken
nothing missing
you have it in control
shalom
shalom
Jehovah my peace
shalom
shalom
Jehovah my peace
ooooooh
say through the fire.
through the fire
through the raging storm
I will not lose my peace
through the valley
through the sweeping floods
I will hold to my peace
through the fire
through the raging storm
I will not lose my peace
through the valley
through the sweeping floods
I will hold to my peace
because nothing is broken
nothing broken
nothing is missing
nothing missing
you have it in control
nothing broken
nothing missing
you have it in control
shalom
shalom
Jehovah my peace
shalom
shalom
Jehovah my peace
