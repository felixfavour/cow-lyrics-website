take this fainted heart
take these tainted hands
wash me in your love
come like grace again
even when my strength is lost
i'll praise you
even when I have no song
i'll praise you
even when it's hard to find the words
louder then I'll sing your praise
I will only sing your praise
take this mountain weight
take these ocean tears
hold me through the trial
come like hope again
even when the fight seems lost
i'll praise you
even when it hurts like hell
i'll praise you
even when it makes no sense to sing
louder then I'll sing your praise
i will only sing your praise
i will only sing your praise
i will only sing your praise
i will only sing your praise
and my heart burns only for you
you are all you are all I want
and my soul waits only for you
and I will sing till the morning has come
lord my heart burns only for you
you are all you are all I want
and my soul waits only for you
and I will sing till the miracle comes
i will only sing your praise
i will only sing your praise
i will only sing your praise
even when the morning comes
i'll praise you
even when the fight is won
i'll praise you
even when my time on earth is done
louder then I'll sing your praise
i will only sing your praise
