Blameless human born to die
Carried hopelessness and turned it into life
Fully broken at the cross
It was love that made a way for what was lost
Hallelujah the Savior King has come
Hallelujah to the only One
Hallelujah will forever be my song
The highest praise to the One who made a way
No more record
Past is gone
Every sinner finds the God with open arms
Hallelujah the Savior King has come
Hallelujah to the only One
Hallelujah will forever be my song
The highest praise to the One who made a way
[Bridge]
My hope is in the Savior, You made a way for me
My hope is in the Savior, forever I am free
My hope is in the Savior, You made a way for me
My hope is in the Savior
