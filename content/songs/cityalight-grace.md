Your grace that leads this sinner home
From death to life forever
And sings the song of righteousness
By blood and not by merit
Your grace that reaches far and wide
To every tribe and nation
Has called my heart to enter in
The joy of Your salvation
By grace I am redeemed
By grace I am restored
And now I freely walk
Into the arms of Christ my Lord
Your grace that I cannot explain
Not by my earthly wisdom
The Prince of life, without a stain
Was traded for this sinner
By grace I am redeemed
By grace I am restored
And now I freely walk
Into the arms of Christ my Lord
Let praise rise up and overflow
My song resound forever
For grace will see me welcomed home
To walk beside my Saviour
By grace I am redeemed
By grace I am restored
And now I freely walk
Into the arms of Christ my Lord
By grace I am redeemed
By grace I am restored
And now I freely walk
Into the arms of Christ my Lord
