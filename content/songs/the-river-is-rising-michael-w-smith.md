I feel it, I feel it, I feel it in my bones
And I just don't think I can hold it anymore
The river is rising, flowing out of me
And I'm coming alive, I'm coming alive
I'm gonna dance and sing and move my feet
'Cause the river is rising, flowing out of me
Got to let the world know, take it to the streets
Got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise
Hallelujah, the river is rising
Hallelujah, the river is rising
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it in my bones
And I just don't think I can hold it anymore
The river is rising, flowing out of me
And I'm coming alive, I'm coming alive
I'm gonna dance and sing and move my feet
'Cause the river is rising, flowing out of me
Got to let the world know, take it to the streets
I got to dance and sing and add a shout of praise
Hallelujah, the river is rising
Hallelujah, gonna dance and sing and add a shout of praise
Hallelujah, the river is rising
Hallelujah
