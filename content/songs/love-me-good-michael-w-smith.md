Sometimes I feel like this world is just one big gigantic merry-go-round
You gotta hold on tight or you get hurled through the air
Yeah, life is a 3 ring circus with clowns and freaks and camels and such
And you never know when you might be attacked by the bears
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Give me love
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Love me good
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Give me love
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Love me good
Sometimes I feel like I'm afraid of my own shadow and then
Sometimes I can feel as bold as Genghis Khan
But I could never live in a yurt on a diet of Mongolian barbecue
I conquer the world for a moment then the moment is gone
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Give me love
Give me love, give me love
Love me good
Love me good
