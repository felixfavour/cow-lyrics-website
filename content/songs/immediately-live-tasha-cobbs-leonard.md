[Chorus]
I came in this place all burdened down
I tried to lift my hands but I was bound
But the Lord our God said to me
If I praise Him now I will have the victory
So I lifted my hands
And opened my mouth
And immediately God worked it out
So I lifted my hands
And opened my mouth
And immediately God worked it out
I came in this place all burdened down
I tried to lift my hands but I was bound
But the Lord our God said to me
If I praise Him now I will have the victory
So I lifted my hands
And opened my mouth
And immediately God worked it out
So I lifted my hands
And opened my mouth
And immediately God worked it out
