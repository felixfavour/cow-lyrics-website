Out of the wilderness
Into Your deliverance
Look where I'm standing now
These hands that once were chained
Now lifted high in praise
Look where I'm standing now
Look where I'm standing now
[Chorus: Phil Wickham]
I stand on the chain-breaking
Miracle-making
Powerful Name of Jesus
On the body-raising
Prodigal-saving
Powerful Name of Jesus
Led by Your mighty hand
Into the promised land
Look where I'm standing now
You carried the cross for me
Now I am a child of the King
Oh, look where I'm standing now (
Look wherе I'm standing
)
Look where I'm standing 
now
