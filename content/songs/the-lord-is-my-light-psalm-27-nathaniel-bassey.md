The Lord is my light and salvation
Whom shall I fear
The Lord is the strength of my life
I will not be afraid
When my enemies came against me
They stumbled and fell (yakata)
Though an host encamp against me
My heart will not fear
The world may rise against me
In You I will put my trust
For You are with me
Yahweh Yahweh Yahweh
The Lord is my light and salvation
Whom shall I fear

Though an host encamp against me
My heart will not fear
The world may rise against me
In You I will put my trust
For You are with me
