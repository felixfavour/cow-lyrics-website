Anyway You bless me
I'll be satisfied
You can wipe the tears from my eyes,
and put joy inside
Anyway You bless me,
I won't complain,
The power of Your Spirit,
It would ease the pain
Any way
Any way
I'll be satisfied
Bless my going out
And my coming in
Put Your Spirit round about
And Your joy within
Any way
Any way
I'll be satisfied
