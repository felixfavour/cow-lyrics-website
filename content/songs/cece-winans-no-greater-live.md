Verse 1]
I've seen many Places
And many Faces I've come to know
Times I've Celebrated
Sweet Drink I've Tasted
They come and go
But there was a Treasure
Poured without Measure
Over the Earth
A Light that's so Bright and
Outshines the Brightest
Lights of the World

No Greater Friend I know
No Greater Peace I know
Noo Greater Hope I know
No Greater Joy I know
I could Search High and Low
Any everywhere I go
No Greater River Flows
Than You Jesus
My Great Inspiration
Hearts Motivation
Still comes from you
No one more Forgiving
No one more Healing
Noo one more True
Your Love is a Treasure
Poured without Measure
Over the Earth (a Light so)
A Light that's so Bright and
Outshines the Brightest
Lights of the World

No Greater Friend I know
No Greater Peace I know
Noo Greater Hope I know
No Greater Joy I know
I could Search High and Low
Any everywhere I go
No Greater River Flows
Than You Jesus
No Greater Lyrics  CeCe Winans

{ So with all my Heart
I Lift You up
(With all my Heart I Lift You up)
And with all my Soul
I Lift You up
(With all my Soul I lift You up)
And with all my Strength
I Lift You up
(With all my Strength I lift You up)
And with all I am I lift You up
(With all I am I lift You up) } [x2]

{ No Greater Friend I know
No Greater Peace I know
Noo Greater Hope I know
No Greater Joy I know
I could Search High and Low
Any everywhere I go
No Greater River Flows
Than You Jesus } [x2]

{ If He's Greater (if He's Greater)
Then let Him be greater
(Let Him be greater)
If He's Stronger (if He's Stronger)
Then let Him be Stronger
(Let Him be Stronger)
If He's higher (if He's higher)
Then let Him be higher
(Let Him be higher)
Let Him be higher x3 } [x3]
Said I searched all over
(said I searched all over) [Repeat]
Still couldn't find nobody
(still couldn't find nobody) [Repeat]

If He's Greater (if He's Greater)
Then let Him be greater
(Let Him be greater)
If He's Stronger (if He's Stronger)
Then let Him be Stronger
(Let Him be Stronger)
If He's higher (if He's higher)
Then let Him be higher
(Let Him be higher)
Let Him be higher x3
Said I searched all over
(said I searched all over) [Repeat]
Still couldn't find it
(still couldn't find it) [Repeat]
