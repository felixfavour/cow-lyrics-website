Fresh fire let it fall
O God hear our call
Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind
We need fresh fire
Fresh fire let it fall
O God hear our call
Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind
We need fresh fire
We are hungry we are thirsty
Crying our for more of You
Lord we are desperate for Your mercy
Let us burn to know Your Truth
Light a flame in us now
Send Your holy fire down
Fresh fire let it fall
O God hear our call
Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind
We need fresh fire
Fresh fire let it fall
O God hear our call
Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind
We need fresh fire
