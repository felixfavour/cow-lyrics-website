{If You're deep in the ocean
Or high on the mountain
Lord, my worship will chase You
My one desire is to
Never be too far away
Draw me close enough
To touch You} [x2]
{If You're deep in the ocean
Or high on the mountain
Lord, my worship
Will chase You
My one desire is to
Never be too far away
Draw me close enough
To touch You} [x2]

Here's my heart of worship
I give it to You
Father, father
Here's my heart of worship
I give it to You Oh, oh
{Here's my heart of worship
I give it to You
Father, father
Here's my heart of worship
I give it to You Oh, oh} [x4]
[Bridge]
I give it to You
Wooh, oh
I give it to You
Wooh, oh
I give it to You
Wooh, oh
I give it to You
Wooh, oh
[Outro]
If You're deep in the ocean
Or high on the mountain
Lord, my worship will chase You
My one desire is to
Never be too far away
Draw me close enough
To touch You
Draw me close enough
To touch You
Draw me close enough
To touch You
