What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Let's just wait on Him for a second!
Come touch Lord
You reward those who honestly, diligently seek You
I wanna see Your face
I wanna know Your grace
Come to restore
We want You more than this world
More than our way, Your way is higher
Your touch is higher
We surrender here to Him
Listen!
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Oh precious! oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
How precious! oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
