ild of promise sent from heaven
Light from light shine down to us
Oh to fill a hungry people
Child of promise, child of God
You are faithful, You are savior
You are more than enough
You are healer, You are holy
You are more than enough
Man of sorrows, heart of mercy
Love raised high upon a cross
Dead to lead us to redemption
Man of sorrows, Son of God
You are faithful, You are savior
You are more than enough
You are healer, You are holy
You are more than enough
You are more than enough
Jesus You are more than enough
Lord of life in glory risen
Love has conquered both sin and grave
Heaven's gates are truly open
Lord of life, King of Kings
You are faithful, You are savior
You are more than enough
You are healer, You are holy
You are more than enough
I'm alive in the arms of love
I lift my hands to the God above
I'm alive in the arms of love
I'm alive in the arms of love
I lift my hands to the God above
I'm alive in the arms of love
I'm alive in the arms of love
I lift my hands to the God above
I'm alive in the arms of love
