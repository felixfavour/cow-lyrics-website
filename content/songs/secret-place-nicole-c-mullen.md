[Psalm: 91:1-4]
He that dwelleth in the secret place
Of the most High shall abide
Under the shadow of the Almighty
He that dwelleth in the secret place
Of the most High shall abide
Under the shadow of the Almighty
I will say of the LORD
He is my refuge and my fortress:
My God; in him will I trust
Surely he shall deliver thee
From the snare of the fowler
My God; in him will I trust
Surely he shall deliver thee
From the snare of the fowler
And from the noisome pestilence
He shall cover thee with his feathers
And under his wings shalt thou trust:
His truth shall be thy shield and buckler
