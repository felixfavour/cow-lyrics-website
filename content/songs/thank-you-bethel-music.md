How do I say thank You, Lord
For the way that You love, and the way that You come
For all that You've done, and all that You'll do
My heart pours out, thank You
You dont have to come, but You always do
You show up in splendor and change the whole room
You don't have to come, but You always do
You show up in splendor and change the whole room
How do I say thank You, Lord
For the life that You gave, the cross that You bore
For the love You poured out to ransom my soul
My heart pours out, this thankful song
You don't have to come, but You always do
You show up in splendor and change the whole room
You don't have to come, but You always do
You show up in splendor and You change the whole room
[Bridge]
You walked through all of my walls
Conquered my shame
Stepped into my past
Filled my world with grace
You didn't have to come, but You wanted to
You walked through all of my walls
Conquered my shame
Stepped into my past
Filled my world with grace
You didn't have to come, but You wanted to
