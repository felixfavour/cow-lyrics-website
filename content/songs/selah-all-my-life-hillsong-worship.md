[Intro]
Better is one day here
Than a thousand elsewhere
We praise Your name
We give You worship, You deserve it
Give You worship, You deserve it
We're listening, God (You're welcome)
What are You saying? What are You doing?
Come now rushing wind
Jesus, breathe within
Come now rushing wind
Jesus, breathe within
Come now rushing wind
Jesus, breathe within
Come now rushing wind
Jesus, breathe within
All my life, all my life
All my life
I will lift up Your praises
'Til the end of the ages
I will sing of Your love
Your love won't stop
Oh, it runs like a river
You have so freely given
Every piece of Your heart
All my life
All my life
I will lift up Your praises
'Til the end of the ages
I will sing of Your love
Your love won't stop
Oh, it runs like a river
You have so freely given
Every piece of Your heart
