[Intro]
One God
One God
One God
Mighty Creator, You give us life
Wonderful Savior, from death You rise
Glory and honor, belong to You alone
There's only
One God, who can make the stars
One God, who saves our hearts
One God, You reign over all
There's only
One God, who can set us free
One God, alive in me
One God, You reign over all
Father of Mercy, You break the chains
"Now there is 'Victory in Jesus' Name"Glory and honor, belong to You alone
There's only
One God, who can make the stars
One God, who saves our hearts
One God, You reign over all
There's only
One God, who can set us free
One God, alive in me
One God, You reign over all
