[Intro]
Ey, yeah
Ah, ey
When the world looks at me
I wonder what they see
Underneath these eyes
Oh, smiles masquerade as pain
Then grow up to be shame
And leave me with a lie
I know they, they don't see my flaws
Or these hidden scars
And all the mess I made
Oh, so don't, don't let Sunday fool ya
Here's my hallelujah
Every single day, I'm running to Your grace
Ey, ey, ey
I'm tired of this dirty heart
That keeps our worlds apart
I need Your loving fire
And even in these church clothes
I can't dress up my soul
To be free is my desire
