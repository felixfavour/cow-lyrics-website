Christ the Lord is risen today
Sons of men and angels say
Raise your joys and triumphs high
Sing ye heavens and earth reply
Sing ye heavens and earth reply
Love's redeeming work is done
Fought the fight, the battle won
Death in vain forbids Him rise
Christ has opened paradise
Christ has opened paradise
Christ the Lord is risen today
Alleluia!
Sons of men and angels say
Alleluia! Alleluia!
He lives again, our glorious King
Where, O death, is now thy sting?
Dying once, He all doth save
Where thy victory, O grave?
Where thy victory, O grave?
Soar we now where Christ has led
Following our exalted Head
Made like Him, like Him we rise
Ours the cross, the grave, the skies
Ours the cross, the grave, the skies
