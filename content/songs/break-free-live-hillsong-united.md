Would you believe me
Would you listen if I told you that
There is a love that make a way
And never holds you back
[Pre-Chorus]
So won't you break free
Won’t you break free
Get up and dance in His love
So won’t you break free
Won't you break free
Get up and dance in His love
God would give His one and only Son
Taking a stand upon the cross
To show us perfect love
[Pre-Chorus]
So won’t you break free
Won’t you break free
Get up and dance in His love
So won’t you break free
Won’t you break free
Get up and dance in His love
Love never ending
