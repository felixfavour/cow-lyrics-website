Lord, You seem so far away
A million miles or more it feels today
And though I haven't lost my faith, I must confess right now that its hard for me to pray
But I don't know what to say and I don't know where to start
But as you give the grace with all that's in my heart
I will sing
I will praise
Even in my darkest time
Through the sorrow and the pain
I will sing
I will praise
Lift my hands to honor You
Because Your word is true
I will sing
Lord, it's hard for me to see all the thoughts and plans You have for me
But I will put my trust in You
Lord will meet Your guide to set me free
But I don't know what to say and I don't know where to start
But as you give the grace with all that's in my heart
I will sing
I will praise
Even in my darkest time
Through the sorrow and the pain
I will sing
I will praise
Lift my hands to honor You
Because Your word is true
I will sing
I will praise
Even in my darkest time
Through the sorrow and the pain
I will sing
I will praise
Lift my hands to honor You
Because Your word is true
I will sing
I will sing
I will sing
