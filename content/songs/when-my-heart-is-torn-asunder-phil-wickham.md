When my heart is torn asunder
And my world just falls apart
Lord, You put me back together
And lift me up to where You are
There is hope beyond the suffering
Joy beyond the tears
Peace in every tragedy
Love that conquers fear
I have found redemption in the Blood of Christ
My body might be dying, but I'll always be alive
You have turned mourning to dancing
You have covered me with grace
The struggle here may last a moment
But life with You, will last always
There is hope beyond the suffering
Joy beyond the tears
Peace in every tragedy
Love that conquers fear
I have found redemption in the Blood of Christ
My body might be dying, but I'll always be alive
