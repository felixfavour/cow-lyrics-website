Don’t know how to LOVE, Without the love, From above, the Love of God
(Repeat)
Oh all about the love, all about the love, all about the love, all about the love
Oh all about the love, all about the love of Jesus, all about the love, all about
Repeat all from the top
Don’t know how to LIVE, Without the love, From Above, the Love of God
(Repeat)
Oh all about the love, all about the love, all about the love, all about the love
Oh all about the love, all about the love of Jesus, all about the love, all about
That’s what it’s all about
Ain’t no living without Him (8x)
Ain’t no living without Him (8x)
That’s what it’s all about (Soprano)
Don’t know how to LOVE, Without the love, From above, the Love of God
Don’t know how to LIVE, Without the love, From Above, the Love of God
Oh all about the love, all about the love, all about the love, all about the love
Oh all about the love, all about the love of Jesus, all about the love, all about the love
All about the love, all about the love, all about the love, all about the love
Oh all about the love, all about the love of Jesus, all about the love, all about the love
Oh all about the love, all about the love, all about the love, all about the love
Oh all about the love, all about the love of Jesus, all about the love, all about the love
