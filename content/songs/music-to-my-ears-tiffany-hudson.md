Your voice is music to my ears
Say the word and everything within me stops to hear
I listen close to catch the song
As the harp begins to play along
With every whisper
Every note
How sweet it is
The melody
How beautiful Your symphony
My Father sings over me
You know the language of my soul
You speak and every single part of me comes home
Youâ€™re my home
I live for this
Each word from Your lips
