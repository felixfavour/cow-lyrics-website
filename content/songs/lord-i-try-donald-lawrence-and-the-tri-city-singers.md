Lord I try
To do my best
But the road seems so hard
To climb
Lord I try
But I don't succeed
Blood, sweat, and tears
And fears
Is there any way
I can make it by myself
I've searched and found
No one else
I need your help
I won't try by myslef
For I know, that help is mine
If I want it
And my help lies in God
And my help lies in God
And my help lies in
God
