"God Of Midnight"
(feat. Aaron Moses)
It's just like You
To wait til the midnight hour
And things seem as good as done
It's just like You
To wait til every option's gone
And my faith is at an all time low
When the odds are stacked against me
And I'm at the end of the rope
My soul reminds my heart of what it knows
That's when You come through
Like You always do
Heart of mine, be confident
Nothing is too hard for Him
I will be still and know
That You're with me, oh
It's just like You
To wait til I'm out of hope
And there's nowhere else to look
It's just like You
To wait til I have no choice
But to give up control
When the odds are stacked against me
And I'm at the end of the rope
My soul reminds my heart of what it knows
That's when You come through
Like You always do
Heart of mine, be confident
Nothing is too hard for Him
I will be still and know
That You're with me, oh
You're never too late
You don't run out of time
I've made up my mind
I trust You, God
I look doubt in the face
And tell it to fall in line
I've made up my mind
I'll trust You God
You're never too late
You don't run out of time
I've made up my mind
I trust You, God
I look doubt in the face
And tell it to fall in line
I've made up my mind
I'll trust You
Oh-oh-oh
I'll trust You, God
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh...
That's when You come through
Like You always do
Heart of mine, be confident
Nothing is too hard for Him
I will be still and know
That You're with me, oh
