I love you lord oh your mercy never fails me
and all my day I've been held in your grace
from the moment that I wake up until I lay my head oh I will sing of the goodness of God
Chorus
All my life you have been faithful
all my life you have been so so good
with every breath that I am able, oh I will sing of the goodness of God .

in my darkest path you're close like no other
I've known as a father, I've known you as a friend oh I have lived in the goodness of God. oooh
