[Intro: Kirk Franklin, 
Choir

Angels we have heard on high
Put your hands together, come on, uh
Good God, uh, you better ask somebody, uh, say it
Come on, uh, good God
Santa Claus ain't got nothin' on this, say it
[Chorus: Choir, 
Kirk Franklin
]
Jesus is the reason for the season, yeah
Yes, He is; oh yes, He is
Oh yes, He is, yeah
(
Come on, come on, come on, ah
)
Jesus is the reason for the season, yeah
Yes, He is; oh yes, He is
Oh yes, He is, yeah
(
Yo Chris, kick it
)
I don't need material things
All I need is the love you bring
This holiday I came to say
That Jesus is the only way
[Chorus: Choir]
Jesus is the reason for the season, yeah
Yes, He is; oh yes, He is
Oh yes, He is, yeah
Jesus is the reason for the season, yeah
Yes, He is; oh yes, He is
Oh yes, He is, yeah
