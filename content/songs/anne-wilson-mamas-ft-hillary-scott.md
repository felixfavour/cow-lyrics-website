I don't know why God made one-bedroom apartments out of state
I don't know why He made hometowns If it's somewhere I can't stay
I don't know why He made growing up But I guess that we're all gonna
Yeah, I don't know a lot of things
But I know why God made mamas
For the open arms to fall into
For the when you don't know what to do
For the phone call sayin' "don't forget I'm always in your corner"
For the heart that makes a house a home
For the knowing that you're not alone
For the "Darling, don't you dare give up Even when you wanna."
Yeah, that's why God made mamas
For putting Band-aids on a scraped up knee
And wiping tears away
For picking up the pieces
When that dream don't go your way
For always giving more than taking
Always knowing what ya need
And showing you that fighting's always best done on your knees
For the open arms to fall into
For the when you don't know what to do
For the phone call sayin' "Don't forget
I'm always in your corner."
For the heart that makes a house a home
For the knowing that you're not alone
For the "Darling, don't you dare give up
Even when you wanna."
Yeah, that's why God made mamas
Oh, oh oh oh
Mamas, mamas
I don't know why God made living life down here so hard to do
But I know why God made mamas
'Cause He knew I needed you
Oh, oh
For the open arms to fall into (fall into)
For the when you don't know what to do (what to do)
For the phone call sayin' "Don't forget
I'm always in your corner." (I'm always in your corner)
For the heart that makes a house a home
For the knowing that you're not alone
For the "Darling, don't you dare give up
Even when you wanna."
Yeah, that's why God made mamas (mamas)
Oh (Mamas)
Oh (Mamas)
Mamas
