When Simon Peter walked abreast, putting his faith unto the test. He said Master, will thou bidst me come unto thee?

Jesus said come, so Peter went, and when the faith he had was spent. Peter sank low, but Jesus had waves roll under his feet!

Under his feet, under his feet, there's not a problem that you'll face, he cannot meet. 

Whenever you've waded out to far in waters too deep, remember when waves are over your head, they're under his feet!

Often, we faint in trials soar, can't face our problems anymore. Forgetting wherever we may go, he's been there before.

We should look up and praise the Lord, He walks the waters and the shores, the heavenly breeze and the thundering seas are under his feet!

Under his feet, under his feet, there's not a problem that you'll face, he cannot meet. 

Whenever you've waded out to far in waters too deep, remember when waves are over your head, they're under his feet!
