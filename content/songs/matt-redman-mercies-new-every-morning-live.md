In brokenness and wandering
Through all my fear and unbelief
Your faithfulness appears to me again
Through mountain top and valley low
In every season, this I know
Your goodness, like the dawn, will break again
All Your mercies rising
In this heart again
And my soul begins to sing
They are new every morning
New every morning
Great is Your faithfulness
Your mercies are new every morning
New every morning
Great is your faithfulness
Every good and perfect gift
In Your endless grace You give
Flowing from the Father's heart to mine
Beams of Heaven as I go
Through this wilderness below
The fullness of Your love for all of time
All Your mercies rising
In this heart again
And my soul begins to sing, sing
They are new every morning
New every morning
Great is Your faithfulness
Your mercies are new every morning
New every morning
Great is Your faithfulness
They are new every morning
New every morning
Great is Your faithfulness
Your mercies are new every morning
New every morning
Great is Your faithfulness
All Your mercies rising
In this heart again
All Your mercies rising
In this heart again
All Your mercies rising
Forever shining
In this grateful heart again
They are new every morning
New every morning
Great is Your faithfulness
Oh, Your mercies are new every morning
New every morning
Great is Your faithfulness
They are new every morning
They are new every morning
Great is Your faithfulness
Your mercies are new every morning
New every morning
Great is Your faithfulness
All Your people sing
Great is Your faithfulness
Jesus, great is Your faithfulness
Yes, they are new every morning
New every morning
Great is Your faithfulness
Your mercies are new every morning
They're always new every morning
Great is Your faithfulness
God, Your people sing
Great is Your faithfulness
Jesus, great is Your faithfulness
