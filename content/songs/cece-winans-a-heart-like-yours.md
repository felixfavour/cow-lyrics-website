I try to reach out for you but I fall
Sometimes you seem so close and yet so far
Oh I need another chance
I need to know your mercy
Just give me the strength to change within
I know that I am not all that I can be
My weakness seems to get the best of me
But as long as you are here
I know that I will make it
Every step along the way
Please hear my prayer
A heart like yours, is my desire
A heart like yours, is what I am searching for
Full of compassion, nothing wrong within
Please hear me Lord, give me a heart like yours
So much grace, so much kindness
So much faith, for ever true
Strong as the wind, soft as the shadows
If just once, I could be like you
Please hear me Lord, give me a heart like yours
Please hear me Lord, give me a heart like yours
