I don't always share these feelings deep inside
You have to read my heart in between the lines
I don't understand the mysteries of faith
My words of wisdom only get in the way
There's no use debating man's philosophies
I can't explain all of my own theology
I've missed the forest for the trees so many times
I've learned to live by faith and not by sight
At the cross stands the answer
At the cross is the truth
There's a hope that's living
In a hopelеss world
The price for sin was paid
At the cross
You know I'vе paid my dues reaching for the prize
I've sung a thousand songs, rhymed a million rhymes
My crazy life has been like music played by ear
I hope the truth is what you hear
At the cross stands the answer
At the cross is the truth
There's a hope that's living
In a hopeless world
The price for sin was paid
