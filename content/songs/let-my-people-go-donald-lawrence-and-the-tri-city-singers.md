(You wanna hear a story?)
(Woo-hoo)
A call was sent to Heaven about power being abused
Heaven chose a deliverer
The most unlikely to be used
Go tell those in power
To whom much is given
(Much is required)
Much is required
Tell them they can't really lead
(They can't really lead)
Unless they're leading with the eyes of those they hired
(They can lead with the eyes of those they hired)
(Those who do the work)
Those who do the work
(They deserve the praise)
They deserve the praise
Their gender shouldn't determine the amount
Or the pay raise
Human trafficking, systematic oppression
To right to left
And left to right
We are all God's children
And we're all precious
(Precious in His eyes)
Let the church say amen
(Amen)
