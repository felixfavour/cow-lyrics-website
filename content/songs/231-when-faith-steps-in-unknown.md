When you call on one who you cannot see and you give him your heart for all eternity that's when faith begins.
When you turn away from all your sin and you trust in the lord to cleanse you within that's when faith begins.
in childlike trust you hold your hand simply believing salvation's plan.

When you feel you can't go on another day yet still somehow you kneel down and pray that's when faith steps in.
When all seems lost there's no hope in sight but still you sing on through the night that's when faith steps in.
Faith brings joy and peace in the midst of a storm. it sends out a life line when you're tossed and worn.

when you say goodbye to your dearest friends and through tear filled eyes you say I'll see them again that's when faith steps in. When you take your last breath in this world down here
and you close your eyes without any fear that's when faith steps in
faith will carry you where feet have never trod, safely to heaven into the arms of God.

When you open your eyes to that heavenly scene and you realize it isn't a dream that's when faith will end.
When you gaze on him face to face and you rest in his sweet embrace
that's when faith will end
oh that's when faith will end.
