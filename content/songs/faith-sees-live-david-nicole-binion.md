We see prison cells, we see graveyards
We see broken lives and hopeless hearts
But faith sees a miracle looking for a home
We see armies rise, we face lion's dens
We hear giants roar You will never win
But faith sees a miracle looking for a home
[Chorus: Todd Dulaney]
Repeat after me
Sing I believe in miracles (I believe in miracles)
And I believe in miracles (I believe in miracles)
And I can see a miracle (I can see a miracle)
Faith sees (Faith sees) a miracle looking for a home
We see deserts but we smell the rain
Hear the thunder, glory's on the way
Faith sees a miracle looking for a home
[Chorus: Todd Dulaney]
I wanna hear you loud, sing
I believe in miracles (I believe in miracles)
And I believe in miracles (I believe in miracles)
That I can see the miracle (I can see a miracle)
Faith sees (Faith sees)
Come on (A miracle looking for a home)
Looking for a home
Looking for a home
