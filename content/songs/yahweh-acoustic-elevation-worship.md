Spirit of Jesus, living within us
Never to fail or forsake
Unending promise, heaven inside us
Whispers the sound of Your name
Holy, Holy is the Lord
Worthy to be praised
Yahweh
Filled with Your wonder, here I surrender
Held in Your mystery of grace
Calling me closer, waking desire
Coming alive in Your name
Holy, Holy is the Lord
Worthy to be praised
Yahweh
Fire, rising in my soul
All consuming flame
Yahweh
