It all revolves
Around Your throne
Who can know Your glory?
So high above
Yet slain for us
You alone are worthy
And the praise is Yours
And the praise is Yours
You're the One we bow before!
Reigning over us
As we lift You up
You will reign forevermore!
The One who was
And is to come
God of every moment
Forever crowned
Exalted now
You alone are holy!
And the praise is Yours
And the praise is Yours
You're the One we bow before!
Reigning over us
As we lift You up
You will reign forevermore!
