[Instrumental]
Every one sing it loud
Shout it out God is good
Everywhere, He is there
We declare God is good
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Your mercy endureth forever
Your mercy endureth forever
You are good, so-o-oo good to me
Oh-oh-ooh, You are good
And Your love never fai-ai-ails
Woah (woah) woah (woah)
Your love never fai-ai-ails
Woah (woah) woah (woah)
Your love never fails
And every day, celebrate
Give Him praise, God is god
And every night come to life
Let it rise God is good
