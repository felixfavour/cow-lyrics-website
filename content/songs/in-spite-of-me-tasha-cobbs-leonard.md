I don't cross every T
I don't dot every I
I've got more flaws than a little
And I messed up a thousand times
I don't always commit
Sometimes I give up way too quick
And then I get tired of trying to run away
From who I am to who I wanna be
[Pre-Chorus]
Some days are better than others
I can be up then I'm down
But beyond my mistakes, I'm found in Your grace
And this one thing will never change
You still love me in spite of me
You still chose me, how can it be?
Every scar, every flaw, You see it all, You see it all
You still love me, love me
Oh, in spite of me
In spite of me
I'm stubborn at heart
I'm quick to put up a guard
I do it all by myself, I won't ask for help
And sometimes my mouth is smart
I can be insecure
Counting other people's blessings
And never stop to notice what I got
