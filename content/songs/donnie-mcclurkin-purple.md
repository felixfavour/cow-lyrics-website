When we praise heaven responds with open arms
When we praise heaven abides within your heart
Just praise through the storm, yes through the rain
Beyond every dark cloud, Beyond all fear and doubt
There's a blessing, a promise awaiting in your praise
Praise unlocks the door it breaks every chain
When we praise God will do the impossible
Praise releases dreams it's all in his name
Just have faith he can do the improvable
Just praise through your struggles and through your pain
Tell of his awesome works, Speak well of his name
Jesus, oh Lamb of God forever shall reign
Just praise through your struggles and through your pain
Just praise through the storm, yes through the rain
Beyond every dark cloud, Beyond all fear and doubt
There's a blessing, a promise awaiting in your praise
We lift our voices in one accord
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh
There is no one, No one like Thee, Holy, Holy
Praise him, Worship Him, Gonna Clap, Gonna Dance, Gonna Shout, Gonna just lift my voice and Praise Him, Worship Him, Gonna Clap, Gonna Dance, Gonna Shout
Sing these praises to you oh lord
Just praise through your struggles and through your pain
Just praise through the storm, yes through the rain
Beyond every dark cloud, Beyond all fear and doubt
Beyond every dark cloud, Beyond all fear and doubt
Beyond every dark cloud, Beyond all fear and doubt
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
There's a blessing, a promise awaiting in your praise
