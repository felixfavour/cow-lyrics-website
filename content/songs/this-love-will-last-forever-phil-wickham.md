I know this is love
I know this is true
Thereâ€™s nothing I need
More than I need You
[Pre-Chorus]
And all I can say, is never enough
With all that I am, I will show my love
Ooh, ooh, I lift up my hands now
Ooh, ooh, God, I will dance now
This love will last forever
You capture my heart, like nobody could
You broke the night and saved my life
Like You said, You would
[Pre-Chorus]
And all I can say, is never enough
With all that I am, I will show my love
Ooh, ooh, I lift up my hands now
Ooh, ooh, God, I will dance now
This love will last forever
