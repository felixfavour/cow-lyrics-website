There is a king seated among us
Let every heart, receive Him now
Where there is praise, He will inhabit
And there will be grace and mercy all around
[Pre-Chorus]
Every burden will be lifted in His presence
Every trophy will be laid down at His feet
There is a name that reigns above all others
Jesus Christ, the king above all kings
Unto the Lamb honor and glory
Worthy is He who overcame
Buried in shame, risen in power
He is alive, and the stone is rolled away
[Pre-Chorus]
All our worship will belong to Him forever
Death is conquered and our Savior holds the keys
There is a name that reigns above all others
Jesus Christ, the king above all kings
