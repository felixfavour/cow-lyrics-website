saviour I come
quite my soul
remember
redemptions Hill
where your blood was spilled
for my ransom
everything i once held dear
I count it all as lost
lead me to the cross
where your love poured out
bring me to my knees
lord I lay me down
rid me off myself
i belong to you
oh lead
lead me to the cross
you were as I
tempted and triled
you are
your word became flesh
bore my sin and death
now you risen
everything i once held dear
I count it all as lost
lead me to the cross
where your love poured out
bring to my knees lord I lay me down
rid me of my self i belong to you
oh lead me
lead me to the cross
to your heart
to your heart
lead me to your heart
lead me to your heart
lead me to the cross where your love poured out
bring me to my knees
lord  I lay me down
rid me off myself I belong to you
oh lead me
lead me to the cross where your love poured out out
bring me to my knees lord I lay me down
rid me of myself I belong to you
oh lead me
lead me to the cross
