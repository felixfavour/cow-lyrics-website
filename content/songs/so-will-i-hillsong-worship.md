God of Creation
There at the start before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of life
And as You Speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapor of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I
I can see your heart in everything you've made
Every burning star a signal fire of grace
If creation sings your praises so will I
So will I
God of your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science follow the sound of Your voice
And as you speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals your nature so will I
