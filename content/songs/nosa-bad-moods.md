right, gimme the bass
Take care
My bad moods (Bad moods)
Can take all on over my mind
Take care
My bad moods (Bad moods)
I'm back to the smiling by nine
Yo, Being frank I see both sides of the ocean
A pretty horizon
And panic-filled lungs
The notion of commotion
When you're chosen
All by the smile of corrosion
Selfish guy with an ego confused
Forget that my point is not the worldview
No bruise on my arm
Yet I'm feeling abused
No jokes on my tongue
Yet I'm feeling amused
You think I don't clock all the slights
So bait how they're waiting for bites
Fight them, it's hook, line, and sinker
So I grew to be more of a thinker
Yo, which maybe ain't good for my mental
Black eye can heal, yet dark thoughts rarely gentle
And pure hearts they bring much more pain than they're worth
You clean up their path and they treat you like dirt
They treat you like something underneath their shoe
Strike after strike, yet they'll never spare you
Or maybe I deep things a little too much
And maybe God made me just way too clued up
And people they tell me I'm chilled and relaxed
Yet inside it's pouring, the roof has collapsed
And sometimes I manage to deal with the floods
But more time I sink and I can't float back up
Stay there
It won't prove (Bad moods)
The things that I'm hiding inside
Stay there
Oh how new (Bad moods)
I've still got a frown on by nine
My bad moods
I've still got a frown on by nine
My bad moods
I'm back to the smiling by nine
