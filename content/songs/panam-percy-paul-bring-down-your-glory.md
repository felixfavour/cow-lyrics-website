rd we are sorry
We've turned around and gone astray
Your trust for us we have betrayed
Your power we don't recognize
Your Lordship we have all despised
We cannot pretend
We all now repent
Forgive us Lord we pray
Bring down Your glory 2x
Where is all the power we have heard about
Your glory and protection for the ones You died for
Something must be truly wrong
With Jesus what can it be
I hear Your voice speaking to my conscience
The church has turned from away You and trust in their doctrines
Giving praise to people
And never talking of Your power
(Lord we are sorry) Lord we are sorry
We've turned around and gone astray
Your trust for us we have betrayed
Your power we don't recognize
Your Lordship we have all despised
We cannot pretend
We all now repent
Forgive us Lord we pray
Bring down Your glory 2x
Your church is now depending on her power
Trusting in her wisdom thinking she can change the world
We need to reach the people
But the power must come from You
(Lord we are sorry) Lord we are sorry
We've turned around and gone astray
Your trust for us we have betrayed
Your power we don't recognize
Your Lordship we have all despised
We cannot pretend
We all now repent
Forgive us Lord we pray
Bring down Your glory 2x
We need You mercy Lord (Bring down Your glory)
We need Your forgivenss Lord (Bring down Your glory)
We need Your revival (Bring down Your glory)
We need Your power (Bring down Your glory)
Bring down Your glory Bring down Your glory
Bring down Your glory Bring down Your glory
Bring down Your glory Bring down Your glory
Bring down Your glory Bring down Your glory
Bring down Your glory Bring down Your glory
Bring down Your glory Bring down Your glory
Bring down Your glory Bring down Your glory
Bring down Your glory
