There's a sling in my voice and a stone in my praise
Pushing back when the darkest weapons form
And there's a power on my lips even death can't defy
When the name of our God is lifted high
'Cause there is resurrection power
When we sing the name of Jesus
Resurrection power
When we raise a mighty sound
So come on let the praise get loud
Make that empty grave resound
'Cause there is resurrection power
In His name
And there are days I have seen filled with heartache and loss
That have buried my heart beneath the weight
But every time His praise breaks out, dead things rise up from the ground
I won't leave my song inside that empty grave
'Cause there is resurrection power
When we sing the name of Jesus
Resurrection power
When we raise a mighty sound
So come on let the praise get loud
Make that empty grave resound
'Cause there is resurrection power
In His name
It's in His name
