VERSE 1:
I am born of God
and i know who I am
I've been bought by His blood All things made new
if you knew me before, I'm no longer the same
who I was is behind and who I am is in Christ
CHORUS:
   Grace is working for me
   ooooo Grace is working for me2
   Grace is working for me
   ooooGrace
   Not by power nor by might
   But your spirit is moving
   Grace is working for me
VERSE 2:
Christ has won it for me
see the smile on my face
now he lives in me
He's with me and for me
There's no holding me
All I need He'll supply
Grace is working for me
(Chorus)
BRIDGE:
It is working3
It's working
Grace is working for me
