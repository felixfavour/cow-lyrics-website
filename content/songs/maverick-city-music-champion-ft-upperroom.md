I've tried so hard to see it
Took me so long to believe it
That You'd choose someone like me
To carry Your victory
Perfection could never earn it
You give what we don't deserve and
You take the broken things
And raise them to glory

You are my Champion
Giants fall when You stand
Undefeated
Every battle You've won
I am who You say I am
You crown me with confidence
I am seated
In the Heavenly place
Undefeated
With the One who has conquered it all
Now I can finally see it
You're teaching me how to receive it
So let all the striving cease, oh-oh
This is my victory

You are my Champion
Giants fall when You stand
Undefeated
Every battle You've won
I am who You say I am
You crown me with confidence
I am seated
In the Heavenly place
Undefeated
With the One who has conquered it all
It all, it all, it all, it all
Who has conquered it all, oh
When I lift my voice
[Bridge]
When I lift my voice and shout
Every wall comes crashing down
I have the authority
Jesus has given me
When I open up my mouth
Miracles start breaking out
I have the authority
Jesus has given me
When I lift my voice and shout
Every wall comes crashing down
I have the authority, yes, I do
Jesus has given me
When I open up my mouth
Miracles start breaking out
I have the authority
Jesus has given me

You are my Champion
Giants fall when You stand
Undefeated
Every battle You've won
I am who You say I am
You crown me with confidence
I am seated
In the Heavenly place
Undefeated
By the power of Your name
I am seated
In the Heavenly place
Undefeated
With the One who has conquered it all
I know who I am because I know whose I am, hallelujah

There's nothing left to prove
There's nothing left to prove
He freely gave it to us
Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice
Freely, He gave
When I come on, sing
[Bridge]
When I lift up my voice and shout, come on
Every wall comes crashing down
I have the authority, Jesus has
Jesus has given me
When I open up my mouth, miracles, signs, wonders, it starts to break out
Miracles start breaking out
I have the authority
Jesus has given me, when I lift
When I lift my voice and shout, come on
Every wall comes crashing down
I have the authority
Jesus has given me, now declare it, when I
When I open up my mouth
Miracles start breaking out
I have the authority
Jesus has given me

You are my Champion, sing it out, come on, giants
Giants fall when You stand
Undefeated
Every battle You've won, I am
I am who You say I am, You crown me
You crown me with confidence
I am seated
In the Heavenly place
Undefeated, by the power, come on
By the power of Your name
I am seated, in Heaven
In the Heavenly place
Undefeated
With the One who has conquered it all
