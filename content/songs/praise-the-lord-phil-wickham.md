[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Awaken my soul, arise and sing
For all that my Savior's done for me
Oh, give Him His praise, worship His name
All that I am, sing hallelujah
Forever I'm free, forever I'm changed
Forever my life defined by His grace
With every step, every breath
All that I am, sing hallelujah
Hey, yeah
Oh, my whole heart, oh, my soul
Let everything within me praise the Lord
Through the shadow, through the storm
Let everything within me praisе the Lord
We praise thе Lord (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
We praise the Lord (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
