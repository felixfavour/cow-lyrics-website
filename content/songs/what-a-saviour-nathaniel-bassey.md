Oh, oh, oh, You Love Me
Ooh, oh, oh, Completely
Oh, oh, oh, You Love Me
You Love me with Everything

There's no Question
Of your Love for Me
There's no fear in your Love

You have Proven Time and Time again
There's no Reason to Doubt

I was Sinking Deep Inside
When you came Calling for Me

Oh what a Savior
Oh what a Salvation

What a Precious 
Hope I have in you
I will not be Ashamed

What a Story of your Amazing Grace
I was Lost now I'm Found

I'm Overflowing with Gratitude
For all of the things you do

My Hearts Desire
Is Just to be Truly Able
To Sing this Song

Oh, oh, oh, I Love You
Ooh, oh, oh, Completely
Oh, oh, oh, I Love You
I Love You with Everything

Oh, oh, oh, I Love You
Ooh, oh, oh, Completely

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Glory to the Lamb
