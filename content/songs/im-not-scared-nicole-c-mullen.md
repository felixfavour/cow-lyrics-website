I’m not scared of the dark anymore
I’m not scared of the night
Cause I know the One who has conquered it all
Yes, I know the One who is Light
He says, be still and know that I am God
Be still and know that I am God
Be still and know that I am God
And Yahweh Yahweh I am God
That’s why I’m not scared of the dark anymore
I’m not scared of the night
Cause I know the One who has conquered it all
Yes, I know the One who is Light yea
I know the One He has conquered it all
Yes, I know the One who is Light, Light yea
Hе’s Light Light
The Lord is my Light line my salvation to worship I fear
Hе’s Light Light
I’m not scared of the dark because I know that He wouldn’t
Light
I can rest because You are You are You are You are
Light Light
