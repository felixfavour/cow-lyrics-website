For all the have trembled
The sun had his it's face and
And all the men that walked with him
Had turned and run away.
They crucified thy Saviour and
Laid him in a tomb
the life that once brought love and hope
Slipped away that afternoon.
Satan gleamed
with pleasure that day at Calvary
For he thought he had won a mighty victory and like him all of the demons of hell began to cheer.
O but little did they know that their end was growing near.
Cause early  Sunday morning
just like Jesus said
he broke the cause of sin and death
And he rose up from the death
Now we have a new beginning
In a kingdom that has no ending
Hallelujah, hallelujah.
Hallelujah Jesus is alive
death has lost its victory
and the grave has been denied
Jesus lives forever
He's alive,he's alive
His the Alpha and Omega
the first and last is he
the cause of sin is broken
and we have perfect liberty
the lamb of God has risen
He's all alive,He's alive
 he's the autor and the finisher of our faith
the stone they threw away is the corner stone today
death has no more victory
 and the grave has no more sting
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Wonderful, counsellor
a mighty God is he
the everlasting father
he's the precious prince of peace
he's the word that lives forever
He alive, he alive.
