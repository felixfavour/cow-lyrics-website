Mountain maker
Ocean tamer
Glimpses of you
Burn in my eyes
The worship of heaven
Fills up the skies
You made it all
Said, "let there be"And there was
All that we see
The sound of your voice
The works of your hands
You do all things well
You do all things well
You do all things well
Star creator
Wind breather
The strokes of your beauty
Brushed through the clouds
Light from the heavens
Touching the ground
