Lord of all the earth
And all of heaven
I come and seek Your face
Worship You with all I have within me
Humbled by Your grace
PRE CHORUS 1:
Every heart every nation
Every tribe all creation
Will bow before Your presence and sing
CHORUS:
You are high and lifted up
You are high and lifted up
And my soul sings hallelujah
To the Lamb
The Lamb of God
VERSE 2:
Lord of righteousness
You come in glory
Bright and morning star
All my days I'll worship and adore You
Healer of my heart
PRE CHORUS 2:
Every prayer every cry
You alone satisfy
We will lift Your praise
Again and again
