At your name, the mountains shake and crumble
At your name, the oceans roll and tumble
At your name, angels will bow, the earth will rejoice, your people cry out
Lord of all the earth we'll shout your name, shout your name
Filling up the skies with endless praise, endless praise
Yahweh Yahweh, we love to shout your name oh Lord
At your name, the morning breaks in glory
At your name, creation sings your story
At your name, angels will bow, the earth will rejoice, your people cry out
There is no one like our God
Jesus we will praise you
There is no one like our God
Sing, Sing
