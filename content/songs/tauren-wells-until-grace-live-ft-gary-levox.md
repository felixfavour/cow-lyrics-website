I knew I was broken but there was no one that I could tell, mmm
Praying felt like I was throwing pennies in a wishing well
And I started believing I was cursed to carry this weight
I was listing the reasons of why I should walk away
Until grace called my name
Oh, I didn't know I could be free
Until grace found me
Until grace broke these chains
Oh, I didn't know I could be free
Until grace found, Your grace found me
I might be looking at a future full of question marks, mmm
But I don't to have all of the answers if You have my heart
In You, I'm finding redemption a little more with every breath
Brand new like the morning, and I'll never forget that...
Until grace called my name (until grace)
Oh, I didn't know I could be free
Until grace found me (oh, found me)
Until grace broke these chains (broke these chains)
Oh, I didn't know I could be free (I could be free)
Until grace found, Your grace found me (Your grace found me)
You came like force of nature, knocked down every wall I made
You rescued my soul when I thought there was no escape, no
You came like force of nature, knocked down every wall I made
You rescued my soul when I thought there was no escape
Until grace, oh
Uh, tell it to Him
Until grace (Until gr-, until grace) called my name (called my name)
Oh, I didn't know I could be free (I didn't know I could be free)
Until grace found me
Until grace
Until grace broke these chains (broke these chains)
I didn't know I could be free
Until grace found, Your grace found me (Your grace found me)
Oh, oh thank You, Jesus
Your grace found me
