Lord I stand in your presence
Wanting you and need you and
I am here and I surrender
All of me so I can see
Your will is where I desire to be
Take all of me oh
All that I have and all that I do
I give it to you, Lord it's for you
Just take my hand and I'll follow you
For all that I have and all that I do is for you
You are my song it's your love that keeps me strong
And you are the light
In the darkness of my night
I'm lost without you
Broken without you
Oh how I need you
Oh how I need you
You make life worth living
Your grace always keep giving
I'm lost without you
Broken without you
Oh how I need you
Oh how I need you
