[Instrumental]
What mercy divine has paid the price
Who died in my shame and gave me life
Your love like a fire has taken hold
'Cause I'm claimed by the cross forevermore
[Pre-Chorus]
I was Yours
The moment You called me Yours
When You laid down Your life for all
And You rose from the grave
When death was defeated by love
Love like fire
Love like fire
Love like fire
Has taken hold of me!
Alive in Your grace for all to see
My life now to show Your love in me
No mountain I face can stand against
'Cause I'm held by Your love that wonâ€™t relent
