Fears got me living with the lights out
Chained down like a prisoner in my own house
Shame cycles like a daily medication
I try but I can't change my situation
Cause the lion comes to rob my joy
Yeah I'm bruised but I'm not destroyed
I'm rising like an army
And you're gonna hear the sound
I'm calling the angels down
I'm storming the gates of hell
Tell the devil he don't own my soul
I'm taking back what the enemy stole
I'm raising the battle cry
I'm holding the banner high
With the power of the Holy Ghost
I'm taking back what the enemy stole
Oh Oh Oh
Take it all back
Take it all back
I'm taking back what the enemy stole
We're done with all the mind games you try to play
If ain't clear yet I want everything you took from me
In the name of the one who is peace, the one who heals all disease
The only reason that I am free, that name is Jesus
Lord of Lords and King of Kings
Jesus
The name that makes the demons flee
I want it all now, I'm taking it back now
Yeah you know it's going down when you hear the sound
I'm calling the angels down
I'm storming the gates of hell
Tell the devil he don't own my soul
I'm taking back what the enemy stole
I'm raising the battle cry
I'm holding the banner high
With the power of the Holy Ghost
I'm taking back what the enemy stole
Oh Oh Oh
Take it all back
Take it all back
I'm taking back what the enemy stole
Take it all back
Take it all back
I'm taking back what the enemy stole
