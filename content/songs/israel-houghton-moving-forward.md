Oh, hey, what a moment you have brought me to?
Such a freedom I have found in you
You're the healer who makes all things new, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not going back, I'm moving ahead
Here to declare to you my past is over in you
All things are made new, surrendered my life to Christ
I'm moving, moving forward, oh
You have risen with all power in your hands
You have given me a second chance
Hallelujah, hallelujah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
I'm not going back, I'm moving ahead
Here to declare to you my past is over in you
All things are made new, surrendered my life to Christ
I'm moving
Not going back, moving ahead
Here to declare to you, my past is over in you
All things are made new, surrendered my life to Christ
I'm moving, moving forward
Said I'm moving forward, oh yeah
Singing you make all things new
Yes, you make all things new and I will follow you forward, oh
You make all things new
You make all things new and I will follow you forward
You make all things new (you make all things new)
You make all things new (you make all things new)
Yeah, and I will follow you, said I will follow you, said I will follow you, oh
You make all things new (you make all things new)
Yes, you make all things new and I will follow you forward
Oh, I will follow, follow, oh, oh
