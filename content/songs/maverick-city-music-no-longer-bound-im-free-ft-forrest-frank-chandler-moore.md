You came to set us free (You came to set us free)
I am no longer bound (Oh, Lord)
You came to set us free
I am no longer bound (Oh, Lord)
Even in the valley of the shadow of death (Yeah)
I can take rest 'cause the living God is living in my chest (Chest)
Everyday I wake up feelin' blessed (Feelin' blessed)
And even if I don't, I see it as a test (As a test)

'Cause I was lost until You found me
Now I know You're all around me
Nothing I could ever do
Could separate my love from You
You came to set us free (You came to set us free)
I am no longer bound (Oh, Lord)
You came to set us free (Came to set us free)
I am no longer bound (Oh, Lord)
(Forrest, Chandler, hold up, hold up)
You take the good and the bad and the ugly
Yeah You turn it around and work it for me
If it's a storm, know the rain's good for me
Brought out my cup, fill it up make it holy
Anoint my head, oh, Lord
Let me not forget, oh, Lord
You've been too too good to me
Don't know where I would be, without You
You came to set us free (You came to, set us free, yeah)
I am no longer bound (Oh, Lord) (Ohh, no longer bound, you came to set us free)
You came to set us free (You-ooo)
I am no longer bound (Oh, Lord)
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
When I look at my hands they look new
When I look at my feet they do too
'Cause I'm free, yeah I'm free
Thank God I'm free, oh I'm free
When I look at my hands they look new
When I look at my feet they do too
'Cause I'm free, yeah I'm free
Thank God I'm free, yeah I'm free
When I look at my hands they look new
When I look at my feet they do too
Cause I'm free, I'm free
Thank God I'm free, yeah I'm free
