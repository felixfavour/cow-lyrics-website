People come, people go
Your life has been out of control
You're confused
Don't worry your soul
It will get better, better
It will get better, better
It will get better
God is in control
Find your praise within your heart
Hold it close
Don't ever depart
It gets cold in the night
But you'll be alright
It will get better, better
It will get better, better
It will get better
God is in control
Whatever state I find myself in
I learned how to be secure
Knowing that God
Will supply all my needs
And He'll work things out for my good
