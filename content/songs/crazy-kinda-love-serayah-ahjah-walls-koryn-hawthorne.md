[Intro]
The definition of love
Your love is so crazy
Once I was a girl, you know the type of girl
The one who thought the world was filled with everything I need
Light shining on me (
Your love is so crazy
)
And any man who called, shut down any mall
The baddest of them all is what I told myself to believe
So I wouldn't feel empty
[Refrain: Serayah]
I lied, I tried, I can't hide deep inside
I need something more
Heaven, open up your door
[Pre-Chorus: Serayah]
Amazing, You're patiently waiting
You say I'm worth saving
You're forever chasing me
[Chorus: Serayah & 
Ahjah Walls
]
You caught me with that crazy kinda love
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy kinda love
The kind of love you don't see 'round here lately
Crazy kinda love
It stays the same when the world keeps on changin'
Crazy kinda love
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy (
Okay
)
