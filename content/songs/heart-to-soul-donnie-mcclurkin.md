Here is my melody, my simple melody
Unto the one wise and true living God
I give my sacrifice because You paid the price
So that my life would have meaning and more
You gave me hope that endures, my fallen soul You secured
Please take my melody, my simple melody
Straight from my heart to Your soul
Straight from my heart to Your soul
Lord, it's coming straight from my heart to Your soul
I sing my song of praise, my simple song of praise
Unto the Lamb that was slain for my sin
I give my offering unto You, Lord and King
Its from victories You've helped me to win
Its a melody filled with You praise, my voice unto You I raise
Please take my song of praise, my simple song of praise
Straight from my heart to Your soul
Straight from my heart to Your soul
Here is my melody, my simple melody
Straight from my heart to Your soul
Here is my melody, my simple melody
Straight from my heart to Your soul
