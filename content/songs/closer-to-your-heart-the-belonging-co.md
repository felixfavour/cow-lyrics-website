I get lost inside this wonder
'Cause there's so much to discover
New dimensions of Your glory
And I've only seen a glimpse
You keep drawing me, You keep drawing me
Closer to Your heart
You keep calling me, You keep calling me
Closer to Your heart
At every facet of Your beauty
My heart responds with Holy, Holy
Oh, You never cease to amaze me
And it's only just the start
Oh, it's only just the start
You keep drawing me, You keep drawing me
Closer to Your heart
You keep calling me, You keep calling me
Closer to Your heart
You keep drawing me, You keep drawing me
Closer to Your heart
You keep calling me, You keep calling me
Closer to Your heart
