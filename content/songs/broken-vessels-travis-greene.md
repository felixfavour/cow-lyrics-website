When there's so much pain
That we cannot find our way
You are the answer still
You are and always will be
What we need

When we know the truth
Yet we turn away from you
You're for the broken still
You are and always will be
What we need

We are broken vessels
You are our Potter
We live in a story
You are the Author
Give us the answer
We'll give the honor
From broken vessels
To our Father
We fall short again
And it looks like we can't Win
You are the answer still
You are and always will be
What we need

When we hear the truth
Sin instead of choosing You
You're for the broken still
You are and always will be
What we need
You're for the broken still
You are and always will be
What we need
When we hear the truth
Sin instead of choosing You
You're for the broken still
You are and always will be
What we need
You're for the broken still
You are and always will be
What we need

We are broken vessels
You are our Potter
We live in a story
You are the Author
Give us the answer
We'll give the honor
From Broken Vessels
To our Father
We are broken vessels
You are our Potter
We live in a story
You are the Author
Give us the answer
We'll give the honor
From broken vessels
To our Father
We are broken vessels
You are our Potter
We live in a story
You are the Author
Give us the answer
We'll give the honor
From broken vessels
To our Father
