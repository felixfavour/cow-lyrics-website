I call Your name
When I'm in over my head
When I'm in over my head
I seek Your face
When I cannot see the end
When I cannot see the end
You hold it all
The darker the night
The brighter the morning
You're in control
The graver the fight
The greater Your glory
No power, no name
Could ever overthrow the cross
Could ever overthrow the cross
Your blood, Your grace
Is my hope when hope is lost
You're my hope when hope is lost
You hold it all
The darker the night
The brighter the morning
You're in control
The graver the fight
The greater Your glory
