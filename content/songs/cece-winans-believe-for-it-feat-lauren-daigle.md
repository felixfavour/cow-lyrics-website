They say these mountains can't be moved
they say these chains would never break
but they don't know you like we do
there is power in your name
we've Heard that there is no way through
we've heard that time will never change
they haven't seen what you can do
there is power in your name
so much power in your name
move the immoveable
break the unbreakable
God we believe
God we believe for it
from the impossible we'll see your miracles
God we believe God we believe for it
we know that hope is never lost ooh
for there is still an empty grave
God we believe no matter what
There is power in your name
so much power in your name
move the immoveable
break the unbreakable
God we believe
God we believe for it
from the impossible we'll see your miracles
God we believe God we believe for it
You are the way where there seems to be no way
 have the final say
we trust in you God you
