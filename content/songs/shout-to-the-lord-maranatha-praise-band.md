Men of faith rise up and sing
Of the great and glorious king
You are strong when you feel weak
In your brokenness complete
Shout to the north and the south
Sing to the east and the west
Jesus is Savior to all
Lord of heaven and earth
Rise up women of truth
Stand and sing to broken hearts
Who can know the healing power
Of our Awesome King of Love
Shout to the north and the south
Sing to the east and the west
Jesus is Savior to all
Lord of heaven and earth
We've been through fire
We've been through rain
We've been refined
By the power of His name
We've fallen deeper in love with you
You've burned the truth on our lips
Shout to the north and the south
Sing to the east and the west
Jesus is Savior to all
Lord of heaven and earth
Rise up church with broken wings
Fill this place with songs again
Of our God who reigns on high
By his grace again we'll fly.Shout to the north and the south
Sing to the east and the west
Jesus is Savior to all
Lord of heaven and earth
Shout to the north and the south
Sing to the east and the west
Jesus is Savior to all
Lord of heaven and earth
