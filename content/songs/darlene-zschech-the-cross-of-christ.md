Grace and mercy beckon me
my heart leans heavenward again
to the love that bought my shame
the cross of Christ my saving grace
My hope is found in Jesus
spirit life rising up in me
my heart is home in Jesus
now forever my soul will sing
lord you reign for eternity
Perfect love has brought me home
this hope an anchor for my soul
spirit draw me closer still
the cross of Christ my faith secure
my hope is found in Jesus
spirit life rising up in me
my heart is home in Jesus
now forever my soul will sing
lord you reign for eternity
come and sing the glory of the lord
come into his presence all the earth
singing halleluia all the glory all the praise
every nation, tribe and every tongue
will declare the work of christ the son
singing halleluia all the glory all the praise
my hope is found in Jesus
spirit life rising up in me
my heart is home in Jesus
now forever my soul will sing
lord you reign for eternity
Jesus christ for eternity
