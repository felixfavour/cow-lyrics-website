Be glad in the Lord and rejoice,
All ye that are upright in heart;
And ye that have made him your choice,
Bid sadness and sorrow depart.

Refrain:
Rejoice, rejoice! Be glad in the Lord and rejoice!

What though in the conflict for right
Your enemies almost prevail,
God’s armies, just hid from your sight,
Are more than the foes which assail.

Though darkness surround you by day,
Your sky by the night be o’ercast,
Let nothing your spirit dismay,
But trust till the danger is past.

Be glad in the Lord and rejoice,
His praises proclaiming in song;
Acclaim him with trumpet and voice,
The loud hallelujahs prolong.
