ace, glorious grace, grace, glorious grace
At the cross You called it finished
Grace, wonderful grace, grace, wonderful grace
At the cross all of my sin is
Covered, covered, covered by Your grace, oh
Covered, covered, covered by Your grace
Grace, beautiful grace, grace, beautiful grace
At the cross, love everlasting
Grace, powerful grace, grace, powerful grace
At the cross all of my past is
Covered, covered, covered by Your grace, oh
Covered, covered, covered by Your grace
No matter what I've done, no matter where I've been
No matter how I fall, You pick me up again
You have removed my shame, You take me as I am
You call me justified, (now I am covered by) now I am covered by Your grace
Covered, covered, covered by Your grace, oh
Covered, (you cover me) covered, oh I'm covered by Your grace
No matter what I've done, no matter where I've been
 I am covered by Your grace
