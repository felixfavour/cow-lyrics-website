My life has been blessed in so many ways. With family and friends day after day, but I can't stay here, soon I'll be gone. I just stopped by, on my way home. 

I just stopped by on my way home. I'm just passing through I can't stay here long. I must go to meet my Jesus all around God's throne. I just stopped by on my way home.

My heart is set on that heavenly shore, my mind is stayed on Jesus my Lord. Well, it seems I can hear that heavenly song. I just stopped by on my way home. 

I just stopped by on my way home. I'm just passing through I can't stay here long. I must go to meet my Jesus all around God's throne. I just stopped by on my way home.
