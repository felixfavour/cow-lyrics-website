What to say, Lord?
It's You who gave me life
And I can't explain just how
Much You mean to me now
That You have saved me, Lord
I give all that I am to You
That everyday I could
Be a light that shines Your name
Hallelujah - spoken
Everyday, Lord
I'll learn to stand upon Your word
And I pray that I
I might come to know You more
That You would guide me
In every single step I take that
Everyday I can
Be Your light unto the world
Everyday, it's You I live for
Everyday, I'll follow after You
Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord
Hey - spoken
You, You, You
