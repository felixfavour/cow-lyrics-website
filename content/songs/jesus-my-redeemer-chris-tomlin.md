You traded riches to run to my rescue
Oh, my redeemer
You take the pieces and turn them to praises
Oh, my redeemer
Oh, my redeemer
Love i cannot deny
Sure as the morning light
Jesus, my redeemer
You paid my ransom
You chose to suffer
Oh, my redeemer
Oh, my redeemer
Love i cannot deny
Sure as the morning light
Jesus, my redeemer
Now i am not ashamed
To you be the highest praise
Jesus, my redeemer
My redeemer
