Thorns on His head, spear in His side
Yet it was a heartache that made Him cry
He gave His life so you would understand
Is there any way you could say no to this man
If Christ Himself were standin' here
His face full of glory and eyes full of tears
And He held out His arms and His nail-printed hands
Is there any way you could say no to this man
How could you look into His tearstained eyes
Knowin' that it's you He's thinkin' of
Could you tell Him you're not ready now
To give Him your life
Could you say that you don't think you need His love
Jesus is here with His arms open wide
You can see Him with your heart
If you'll stop lookin' with your eyes
He's left it up to you, He's done all that He can
Is there any way you could say no to this man
How could you look into His tearstained eyes
Knowin' that it's you He's thinkin' of
Could you tell Him you're not ready now
To give Him your life
Could you say that you don't think you need His love
