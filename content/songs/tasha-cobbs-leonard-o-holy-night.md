oh holy night...
the stars are brightly shining.....
it is the night of our dear savior's birth, long lay the world in sin and they're pining...  till he appear and the soul felt it's worth......
รก tree of hope...
the weary world rejoices
for yonder breaks
a new and glorious morn
chorus
fall on ur knee....
oh hear the Angels voices
ooooo night aaaa divine
oh night, when Christ was born
oh night...... Divine. o night oh night divine
true.... it hurts us to love one another
his always love  and his scar borne his peace
chains he shall break
for the slavince  are Brothers
and then his name all  oppression will seize
sweet hands of joy
in grateful call his praise be
with all our heart we'll praise his holy name...
Christ Jesus Lord
and men praise
will his praise n glory n forevermore proclaim (2)
 (repeat chorus)
