There is a mountain
That is higher than all other
There is a river
that flows with life
There is a people
That is called by the name of Yah
A nation whose ruler is God
We are the answers
To the questions of this world
We are solutions
we are the light
We are the watchers
Who stand by night
Tell the people about the sound of rain
I hear the sound of rain
I hear the rolling clouds
I hear the voice of GOD
I hear the sound of rain
See the people are raging
Raging against the Lord of Hosts
And they hate the Anointed
Because He has His name on Him
But we will rise
in the Name of our King
This will happen because of the sound of rain
Say to the people of Zion
Good things are spoken of your nation
Because Yahweh has gone ahead of you
He rules with the rod of iron
Say to the people of Babylon
The sceptre of your power is broken
This will happen because of the sound OF rain
Say to the people of Zion
Good things are spoken of your nation
Because Yeshua is ahead of you
He rules with the rod of iron
Say to the people of Babylon
The sceptre of your power is broken
This will happen because of the sound OF RAIN
WE ARE THE SOUND OF RAIN
WE ARE THE ROLLING CLOUDS
WE ARE THE VOICE OF GOD
WE ARE THE SOUND OF RAIN
