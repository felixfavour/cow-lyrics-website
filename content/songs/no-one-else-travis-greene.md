You give me attention
Even when I don’t deserve it
And even when I don’t feel worth it
Call me Your own (Call me Your own)
Through every condition
From Your will I drift the furthest
I admit I’m far from perfect
But I’m not alone (I'm not alone)
You’ve given me what I need
You filled this empty hole in my heart
Yeah, yeah
What I found in You no one else could do
You give me permission to raise my voice in worship
In Your love I find my purpose I’m not alone
No, no, no
You’ve given me what I need
You filled this empty hole in my heart
Yeah, yeah
What I found in You no one else could do
[Musical Interlude]
