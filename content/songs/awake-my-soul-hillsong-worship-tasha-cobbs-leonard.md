There is a sound I love to hear
It's the sound of the Saviour's robe
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear praises, He hears faith
[Chorus: Brooke Ligertwood]
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
Oh-oh-oh, awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
[Interlude: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
Oh, oh-oh oh, hallelujah
His praise, yeah
There is a sound that changes things
The sound of His people on their knees
Oh wake up you slumbering
It's time to worship Him
[Chorus: Brooke Ligertwood & Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
Oh-oh-oh, awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
