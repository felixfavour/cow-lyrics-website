Destroy this temple and in three days, I will raise it up [x3]
Early Sunday morning as the noon day was dawning,
Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to the tomb.
Behold! There was a great earthquake! [x2]
For the angel of the Lord descended from Heaven
The angel of the Lord descended from Heaven [x3]
And rolled, rolled
And rolled,
Back the stone.
His countenance was like lightening and his raiment was as white as snow. [x3]
And for fear of Him the keepers did shake and became as dead men.
Fear not. [x3]
For I know ye seek Jesus who was crucified.
He is not here [x4]
For He has risen as he said.
Yeah!
See the place where the Lord lay.
Fear not. [x3]
For I know ye seek Jesus who was crucified.
He is not here [x4]
For He has risen as he said.
Yeah!
See the place where the Lord lay.
Remember how He said while He was yet in Galilee
I'll rise, I'll rise, Again [x4]
Alleluia [x3]
Amen [x6]
