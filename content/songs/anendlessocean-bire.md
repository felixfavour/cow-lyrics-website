Kowolosoke ooo
In allegiance
Since I took a glance I been stuck on you
By still waters you lay me o
Show your countenance
Desperate o
I'm latching onto you
I for one
Oh I'm surrounded
Pull me from the deep ends
Pull me close to you
Dusk till Dawn
You leave me enchanted
My heart has an address o it resides with you
There's not in this life
Bire Bire Bire Bire Bire oooo
How wonderful
How beautiful to be loved by you
To be loved by you
Cannot deny
Bire Bire Bire Bire Bire oooo
How wonderful
How beautiful to be loved by you
To be loved by you
Here or the after o
In elegance
You reign you reign and none can fill your shoes
Kingdoms have fallen but you're still gallant
I know I know that I can count on you
I for one
Oh I'm surrounded
Pull me from the deep ends
Pull me close to you
Dusk till Dawn
You leave me enchanted
My heart has an address o it resides with you
There's not in this life
Bire Bire Bire Bire Bire oooo
How wonderful
How beautiful to be loved by you
To be loved by you
Cannot deny
Bire Bire Bire Bire Bire oooo
