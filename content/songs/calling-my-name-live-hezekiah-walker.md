How many times do I go against Your will
Then You forgive me, but yet I still
Turn around and do the things
The things I shouldn't do
'cause I belong to You
And I know You will come through
Lord, I know, I take advantage of grace
Here in this Christian race;
But yet I still hear You calling my name
How many times will it take for me to learn
That it's only in Your will, I'll ever earn
I'll ever earn my life's reward;
The honor due to me, life eternally
Riches in glory
Lord, I know, I know I don't belong
With You 'cause I've done wrong;
But yet I still hear You calling my name
How many times do I go against Your will
Then You forgive me, but yet I still
Turn around and do the things
The things I shouldn't do
'cause I belong to You
And I know You will come through
Lord, I know, I know I don't belong
With You 'cause I've done wrong;
But yet I still hear You calling my name
