Jesus, my living water
Name above all names
Lamb of God, new life giver
You conquered the grave
[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't have to wonder where
My hope is coming from
I lift my hands for who You are
And everything You've done
Oh, oh, oh
I know what I'm reaching for
I know what I'm reaching for
I'm reaching for You, I'm reaching for You
Oh, oh, oh
I know what I'm living for
I know what I'm living for
I'm living for You, I'm living for You
Healer of broken people
You're never far away
I draw close, you draw closer
Meet me in this place
