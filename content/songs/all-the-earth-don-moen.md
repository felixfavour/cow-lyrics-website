Father
Into Your courts I will enter
Maker of heaven and earth
I tremble
In Your holy presence
Glory
Glory in Your sanctuary
Splendor and majesty Lord
Before You
All life adores You
All the earth will declare
That Your love is everywhere
The fields will exalt, seas resound
Hear the trees' joyful cry
Praising You and so will I
A new song I'll sing
Lord I will glorify and bless Your Holy Name
Father
Into Your courts I will enter
Maker of heaven and earth
I tremble
In Your holy presence
