[Intro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh)
From the lips of desperation
Different nations, every man's cry 
(Ooh)
Comes a song of anticipation
As we wait for a crack in the sky 
(Ooh)
Side by side, we recognize that
Hope has brought us together tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus: tobyMac]
Break open the sky
Won't You turn off gravity so we can fly?
We wanna see Your face
So tear the roof off this place
Jesus, break open the sky
[Post-Chorus: tobyMac]
So we sing
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
