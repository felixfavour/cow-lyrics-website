Love Song Lyrics by TRAVIS Greene ft Madison Binion
Music Starts, Dancing begins
You grab my Heart and Pull it in
Closer to your Heart beat
Is that Tempo now
Here we are, No one is left
The Two of us
And nothing else
Ever Compares to this Moment

I Love to Sing to You
There is nothing else
That I would Rather do
Everything that I Desire is Found in You
Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus 
You are my Love Song
The Times have Changed
Sound has Evolved
But You Remain Unmoved at all
By anything I've done to You
So I am coming back
With a Voice
Don't need a Stage to Open up
So much to Say
I will let my Heart do the Talking

I Love to Sing to You
There is nothing else
That I would Rather do
Everything that I Desire is Found in You
Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus 
You are my Love Song
Oh, You are my Love Song
I Love to Sing to You
There is nothing else
That I would Rather do
Everything that I Desire is Found in You
Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus 
You are my Love Song
Oh, You are my Love Song
