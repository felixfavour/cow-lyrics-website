I saw Satan fall like lightning
I saw darkness run for cover
But the miracle that I just can't get over
My name is registered in Heaven
I believe in signs and wonders
I have resurrection power (Yes I do)
Still, the miracle that I just can't get over
My name is registered in Heaven
Yeah, my praise belongs to You forever
This is my testimony
From death to life
'Cause grace rewrote my story
I'll testify
By Jesus Christ, the righteous
I'm justified
This is my testimony
This is my testimony (Hey)
Come together, sons and daughters
Bought with blood and washed in water
Sing the praises of the Spirit, Son, and Father
Our God will finish what He started
Yes, our God will finish what He started (Oh)
