If it’s bandaging the broken
Or washing filthy feet
Here I am Lord, send me
If it’s loving one another
Even when we don’t agree
Here I am Lord, send me
If I’m poor or if I’m wealthy
I’ll serve You just the same
Here I am Lord, send me
On the mountain or the valley
I will choose to praise
Here I am Lord, send me
If I’m known by how I love
Let my life reflect how much I love You
I love You
And before You еven ask
Oh my answer will be yеs
‘Cause I love You
Oh I love You
If the truth cuts like an arrow
I will say it anyway
‘Cause here I am Lord, send me
If it’s means that they’ll reject me
Lord I will still obey
‘Cause here I am Lord, send me
