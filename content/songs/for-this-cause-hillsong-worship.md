Hope has found its home within me
Now that I've been found in You
Let all that I am be all You want me to be
'Cause all I want is more of You
'Cause all I want is more of You
Let Your presence fall upon us
I want to see You face to face
Let me live forever lost in Your love, yeah
'Cause all I want is more of You
'Cause all I want is more of You
I'm living for this cause
I lay down my life into Your hands
I'm living for the truth
The hope of the world, in You I'll stand
All I want is You
Let Your presence fall upon us, Jesus
I want to see You face to face
Let me live forever lost in Your love, yeah
'Cause all I want is more of You
'Cause all I want is more of You
I'm living for this cause
I lay down my life into Your hands
I'm living for the truth
The hope of the world, in You I'll stand
