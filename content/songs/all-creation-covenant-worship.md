Here we are
Open arms, every heart
Overcome
By Your love and freedom
Here we stand
Lifted hands unto the King
Every day
Giving thanks, bringing our
Everything
To the One deserving
All the praise
That our hearts could ever sing
Oh, You are amazing God
The Everlasting One
You are the Risen King
Oh, You are the Sovereign God
You reign victorious
You are the Risen King
Let all creation sing
Every day
Giving thanks, bringing our
Everything
To the One deserving
All the praise
That our hearts could ever sing
