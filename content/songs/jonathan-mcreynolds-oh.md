Oh oh oh oh oh...
See there are a lot of substitute guys
That someone's going to worship
And it ain't even funny
They're wasting their money
On a trend they just now heard of
Just to humble the truth
That I found in you
The one and only Jesus
And some won't admit it
And some just don't get it
Would you never ever leave us
So I shout it
Yes I shout it
From the rooftops I shout it
Oh oh oh oh oh
I believe in you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm so in love with you
[x2]
See I'm not the judge
But I can't ignore it
When I see a believer
So afraid to proclaim
The fame of your name
Then I see them at the ball game
Giving glory to man
When you're the creator
The celebrity of ages
And I won't be quiet
I'm too excited
Every chance I get to show it
I shout it
Yes I shout it
From the rooftops I shout it
Oh oh oh oh oh
I believe in you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm so in love with you
[x2]
Cause you been so good
And there's nobody like ya
Still can't believe someone is still missing out
On a God that loves ya
When nobody likes ya
Sees every need behind every thought
But as for me
I am persuaded
That you are the best thing to happen to me
So I shout it out
Tell everyone
All about
You
Oh oh oh oh oh
I believe in you
Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm so in love with you
[x2]
