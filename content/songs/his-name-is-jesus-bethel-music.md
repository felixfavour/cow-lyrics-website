The King is in the room
Come see the scars of love upon His hands
The King is in the room
We'll watch the darkness flee at His command
Who is this King? Who is this King?
His name is Jesus, His name is Jesus
Light of the world, there's freedom in His name
Awesome in power, reigning forever
Light of the world, there's freedom in His name
There's freedom in His name
(The Healer's in the room)
The Healer's in the room
Let miracles break out across this place
The Savior's in the room
No soul beyond the boundaries of His grace
There's resurrection power in His name
His name is Jesus, His name is Jesus
Light of the world, there's freedom in His name
Awesome in power, reigning forever
Light of the world, there's freedom in His name
There's freedom in His name
