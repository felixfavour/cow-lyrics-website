While travelling through this world of sorrow
I'm on my way to glory land
I'll not turn back for some tomorrow
My trials here I'll understand

I want to know more about my Jesus 
I want to know more About my Lord 
I want to know more about that mansion I'm gonna receive as my reward I want to know more about that homeland I mean to go there someday, somehow And after I reach (that heavenly city I mean to know more that I know now 

I'm glad I know the blesses Savior
for through his blood, he set me free
though rough the road
I shall not waver
for some glad day
his face I'll see

I want to know more about my Jesus 
I want to know more About my Lord 
I want to know more about that mansion I'm gonna receive as my reward I want to know more about that homeland I mean to go there someday, somehow And after I reach (that heavenly city I mean to know more that I know now 

He promised when His soul ascended
"I'm coming back" the Lord did say
If on His promise you've depended
On wings of love you'll soar away

I want to know more about my Jesus 
I want to know more About my Lord 
I want to know more about that mansion I'm gonna receive as my reward I want to know more about that homeland I mean to go there someday, somehow And after I reach (that heavenly city I mean to know more that I know now
