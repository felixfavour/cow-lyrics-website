o come let us adore him 2
oo come let us adore him...Christ the lord.
o come all ye faithful
joyful and triumphant
o come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem
come and behold him
born the king of angles
o come let us adore him
o come let us adore him
o come let us adore him
Christ the lord.
Sing choir of angles
sing in exultation
sing o ye citizens of heaven's above
Glory to God, Glory in the highest
o come let us adore him
o come let us adore him
o come let us adore him
Christ the lord.
