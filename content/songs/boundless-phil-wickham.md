[Intro]
Oh, oh-ooh
Oh, ooh, oh, oh
Love so deep
You jump right in and just keep falling
Love so high
All the stars can't comprehend
And love so wide
East and west can't wrap their miles around it
Your love is boundless
Your love is boundless
And love so deep
You jump right in and just keep falling
Love so high
All the stars can't comprehend
And love so wide
East and west can't wrap their miles around it
Your love is boundless
Your love is boundless (Oh, oh-ooh)
[Outro]
Oh, oh-ooh
Oh, oh-ooh
Oh, ooh, oh, oh
