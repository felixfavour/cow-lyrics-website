Jesus, Jesus 
How I love calling your name 
Jesus, Jesus 
Everday, your name is the same 

When troubles surround me
And I didn't have to dispare
Lord you showed me
That you'll always be right there
It seems like all my problems
Had just begun
I didn't have to worry no more
They were already won

I remember the time
When I felt so all alone
And I needed you Jesus
All I had to do was call
Sometimes in the morning
Sometimes late at night
But when I get on my knees Jesus
Everything was alright
