1. Some say, we are cowards,
And others think we are blind,
But we'll see who'll get the rewards,
When the Lord's glory we shall find.
See them gathering horses,
And weapons of war..
They are sitting around tables in the dark, setting strategies on the mark.
Chorus: But soon the war will be over ..
Soon the war will be over,
And soon the looser will suffer,
Soon the looser will suffer,
Those who fight on their knees have got Victory in the spirit,
But those who fight on horses will see death when all the earth is fulfilled ..
2. Speech: Well, listen to me now
The truth is very simple
You have to win or you loose
But when you see the blind, the leper and the cripple that are saying of their happiness
Tell me, how can they fight, when they cannot see, their hearts are filled with fear
Their only weapon is the sward, but we have the power of the WORD.
Speech: Let God..... Arise
And let all His enemies be scattered
Let them flee before Him like chaff before the winds and let them melt like wax before the fire but the heirs of Salvation shout the shout of VICTORY....And let us all rejoice because the Lord God Almighty, He has given us the land and let us go and possess our possessions..
heeeeeee....hiiiiii
Chorus: Soon the war will be over
