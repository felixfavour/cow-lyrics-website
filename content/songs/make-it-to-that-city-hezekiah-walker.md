Chorus
I'm, I'm gonna make it
With Jesus on my side I know I will
I'm, I'm gonna make it;
Make it to the city called heaven (2x)
Verse 1
With Jesus on my side I'll make it
Sometimes though the way may seem hard
Gotta press my way through trials and tribulations
If I'm gonna win to be strong
Chorus
Verse 2
If it takes this whole life, said I'm gonna make it
Sometimes though the way may seem hard
Through my trials and my tribulations
If I'm gonna win, I've gotta stay strong
Bridge
If it cost my life, I've got to make it
Make it that to that city called heaven
Vamp 1
I've got to make it
Make it that city
