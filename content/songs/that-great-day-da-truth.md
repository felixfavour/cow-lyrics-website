Take my riches - take my fame
Take the microphone - take the stage
Take my glory - take my name
Take, take, take, take, take it away
Suffer now - later we'll reign
And that applies to the saints that went against the grain
Life is hard but amidst the pain
You know the saints fight hard, we anticipate
That great day
When God applauds there'll be no remorse and no shame
Everything you thought you lost, you'll regain
And you'll get rewards because you behaved
Let me make it plain
All of the faithful saints will get paid
To prove your commitment to God is not vain
Then we'll get to enter the joy of our King
When I see His face
Not worried bout the things He'll say
I'll get my reward
