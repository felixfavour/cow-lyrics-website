Through your story is My fingerprint
In the valley there is confidence
In the shadow, I will be your strength
One thing's for sure, I am your Lord
Yes, I am
I am, I am
Through the chaos, I will be your joy
When you're finished, I have so much more
In the waiting, I'm an open door
Stand still and know, I am your Lord
[Chorus: Steffany Gretzinger]
They'll be times when you're up
And times when you're down
I'm never too far
Just look around and you'll find Me
I'm by your side, arms open wide
I am good, you are loved
Oh, I am good, you are loved
Oh, yes, you are loved, you are loved
[Bridge: Travis Greene, 
Travis Greene & Steffany Gretzinger
]
What was and is, is covered
By the One who was and is
You're covered by love
What was and is, is covered
By the One who was and is
You're covered by love
I am good, you are loved
, oh
Oh, I am good, you are loved
Yes, you are loved
