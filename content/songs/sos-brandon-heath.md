I've been blinded by insecurity
And all the pain I feel
Could be the death of me
I'm surrounded by
Fear that won't let go
If there's a way out
Someone let me know
I'm reachin' out
One last plea
Is hope all gone? Somebody save me
S.O.S., I'm lost at sea
Is hope all gone? Somebody save me
I've seen traces of
Joy that never ends
But it seems so far away
If it's even real
There must be more than this
So change me if it's true
If you are for real
Help me follow you
