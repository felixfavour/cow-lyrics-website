[Instrumental]
And what does it sound like when you sing heaven's song?
And what does it feel like when heaven comes down?
And what does it look like when God is all around?
Let it come
Let it come
And what does it sound like when you sing heaven's song?
And what does it feel like when heaven comes down?
And what does it look like when God is all around?
Let it come
[Refrain]
Oh-yeah-eh-ehh, yeahh-ehhh
Yeah-eh-ehh, yeah-eh-ehh-ehhh
Yeah-eh-ehh, yeahh-ehhh
And this is what it sounds like when you sing heaven's song
And this is what it feels like when heaven comes down
This is what it looks like when God is all around
Let it come
Yeah, this is what it sounds like when you sing heaven's song
And this is what it feels like when heaven comes down
This is what it looks like when God is all around
Let it come
