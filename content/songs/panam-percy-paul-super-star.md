ey call me the super star 2x
Jesus is the one who made me what I am
Jesus is the one who gives me the songs I sing
Jesus is the one who died to make me free
He is the superstar
He is the superstar
He is the superstar
They say how could I sing the way I do
I just tell them that I could never sing this way without the Lord
They say how could I play the way I do
I just tell them that I could never play this way without the Lord
But they call me (Call me)
The superstar
Jesus is the one who made me what I am
Jesus is the one who gives me the songs I sing
Jesus is the one who died to make me free
He is the superstar
He is the superstar
He is the superstar
Maybe God has blessed you with a special talent
You are so proud
And every little thing that you do
You say it's my strength
(You know without me it wouldn't have been possible)
Suppose God will come on down to you
And take away the gift
I wonder what you will be
But a fool
Will they call you (Call you)
The superstar
Jesus is the one who made me what I am
Jesus is the one who gives me the songs I sing
Jesus is the one who died to make me free
He is the superstar
He is the superstar
He is the superstar
We'll never need the sun
We'll never need the moon
We'll never need the star
Jesus is the light
In that glorious home
We'll never need the sun
Because Jesus will be shinning
He is my Superstar
He is all I need
He is the Superstar
Jesus the Superstar
He is the Superstar
Jesus the Superstar
He is the Superstar
Jesus the Superstar
Superstar
