mighty God
hallow be thy name
faithful God
you are worthy to receive all the praise
you alone you're the air that breath,the song that i sing,you're the lover of my soul
with you there is no impossibility
with you I can move the mountains
what ever you say it will surely come to pass
at the mention of your name every kneel must bow
  chorus
ohhhh unchangeable 2
reliable 2
only you can do what no man can dow
