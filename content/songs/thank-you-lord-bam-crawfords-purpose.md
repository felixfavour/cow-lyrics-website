All nations of the earth
Give thanks unto the Lord
Jesus we do thank You
For that day at Calvary
You died to set us free
And we owe so much to You
All the words cannot repay
We want to say
Thank You, Lord
(Thank You, thank You, thank You)
Thank You, Lord
(We thank You, thank You, thank You)
Jesus we do thank You
You destroyed the devil's plan
Took our lives out of his hand
And Jesus we bow to You
In every nation we are free
With thanksgiving
We worship thee
(Thank You, thank You, thank You)
Thank You, Lord
(We thank You, thank You, thank You)
All nations of the earth
(All nations of the earth)
In every tongue and every kindred
(Give thanks unto the Lord)
