Lead my heart into deeper waters
Lead my faith beyond the shallows of my creature comfort
Dare my trust into all Your greatness
Some place wilder than the safety of these old familiar shores
[Refrain]
'Cause I know there's so much more
And I'm desperate to explore
All the grace beyond these shores
Teach my soul not to fear the darkness
Teach my heart to fully lean on Your cross for comfort
Bind my step to Your steadfast promise
Let my faith run like lightning on the lamplight of Your Word
[Refrain]
'Cause I know there's so much more
And I'm desperate to explore, ooh
All the grace beyond these shores
I got the hope of Heaven running through my bones
And the blood of Jesus in my veins
I got a soul on fire in the Holy Ghost
And all my strength is in Your name
'Cause now this world holds nothing on this grace I know
And I know Your love will never fail
And if there's deeper waters to this life You hold
Sink or swim, I'll never be afraid
