When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My Richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride
See from His head His hands His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown
Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross
Bids me come and die and find
that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross
All who gather here by grace
draw near and bless your name
Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all
Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross
Bids me come and die and find
that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross
All who gather here by grace
draw near and bless your name
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all
and the beauty and the shame
in the glory of His name
Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross
Bids me come and die and find
that I may truly live
Oh the wonderful cross
Oh the wonderful cross
All who gather here by grace
draw near and bless your name
