Let my heart be a sanctuary
Let my mouth be filled with praise
Let our songs be never ending
Let our lives exalt Your name
We were created in Your image
Made in the likeness of who You are
Joined with the angels and all of creation
Singing as one to praise You God
So let my heart be a sanctuary
Let my mouth be filled with praise
Let our songs be never ending
Let our lives exalt Your name
Let my heart be a sanctuary
Let my mouth be filled with praise
Let our songs be never ending
Let our lives exalt Your name
Every breath, every step I'll pour out
On an altar of praise my life is found
Every breath, every step I'll pour out
On an altar of praise my life is found
Every breath, every step I'll pour out
On an altar of praise my life is found
Every breath, every step I'll pour out
On an altar of praise my life is found
Every breath, every step I'll pour out
On an altar of praise my life is found
Every breath, every step I'll pour out
On an altar of praise my life is found
Let my heart be a sanctuary
Let my mouth be filled with praise
Let our songs be never ending
Let our lives exalt Your name
Let our lives exalt Your name
Let our lives exalt Your name
