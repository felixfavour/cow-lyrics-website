Jizọs, aha n'atọ mụ ụtọ
Jizọs, aha n'atọ mụ ụtọ 
(Jesus, a sweet name so sweet)

Jizọs aha kachasị ebube, site na ugwu rue na ndịda 
(Jesus, a Glorious name beginning from the mountain to the valley)

Jizọs aha Gị dị ụtọ, Jizọs, Jizọs 
(Jesus, Your name is sweet)

Jizọs aha kachasị ebube, na-enye ndụ, ndụ ruo ebighị ebi. 
(Jesus, a Glorious name that gives life, an everlasting life.)
