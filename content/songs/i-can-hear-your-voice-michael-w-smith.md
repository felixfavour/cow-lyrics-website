[Instrumental]
I'm in the river that flows from Your throne
Water of Life, Water of Life
It covers me and I breath again
Your love is breath to my soul
I can hear Your voice as You sing over me
It's Your song of hope breathing life into me
I can feel Your touch as I come close to You
And it heals my heart, You restore and renew
I'm in the river that flows from Your throne
Water of Life, Water of Life
It covers me and I breath again
Your love is breath to my soul
I can hear Your voice as You sing over me
It's Your song of hope breathing life into me
I can feel Your touch as I come close to You
And it heals my heart, You restore and renew
