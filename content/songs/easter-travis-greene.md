So many charges
I was in debt over my head
Couldn’t afford it
But someone paid for it instead
It took a while to recognize
That what I owe did not exist no more
[Pre-Chorus]
What I could not pay
He handled for me
He took the bill and the receipt
It's signed in blood (Blood, blood)
An outstanding balance (Oh my God)
That I could not rectify, all out of options
But you settled just in time (Hey)
I couldn’t understand how
What I owe did not exist anymore
[Pre-Chorus]
What I could not pay
He handled for me
He took the bill and the receipt
It's signed in blood
