Hail Jesus, You're my King
Your life frees me to sing
I will praise You all my days
You're perfect in all Your ways
Hail Jesus, You're my Lord
I will obey Your word
I want to see Your Kingdom come
Not my will but Yours be done
Glory, glory to the Lamb
You will take us into the land
We will conquer in Your name
And proclaim that "Jesus reigns"
Hail, hail, Lion of Judah
How powerful You are
Hail, hail, Lion of Judah
How wonderful You are
Hail Jesus, You're my King
Your life frees me to sing
I will praise You all my days
You're perfect in all Your ways
Hail Jesus, You're my Lord
I will obey Your word
I want to see Your Kingdom come
Not my will but Yours be done
