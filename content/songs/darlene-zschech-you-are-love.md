You are love
Here in this place of worship
You draw me close again
All of my weakness is laid here
You cover them all in your strength
Here in your holy presence
My heart draws close to you
This altar is built out of broken
And you come and breathe it all new
You are love, love unfailing,
Love divine
You are love, love that mends
A heart like mine
Here in this timeless moment
Angels are singing your name
For your love endures forever
You're always and ever the same
(Cho. 1 & 2)
You are love, lifted high for all to see
You are love, the heavens sings of
Your glory... you are love
Love that is healing, love that is trusting
A love that demands my heart & soul
A love that awakens, my purpose & being
Your love
(Cho. 1 & 2)
