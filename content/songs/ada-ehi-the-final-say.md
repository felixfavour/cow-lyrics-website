God, Your love never runs out
It's deeper than the endless sea
Your glory never fades out
You're the One that we adore
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
The one that we adore
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
King of the universe
Jesus, You have the final say
We have seen Your faithfulness
You are who You say You are
Oh oh oh oh
Your word will never fail
You have the final say
God, You never lose a battle
In Your name we have overcome
Nothing can contain You
Your word will come to pass
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Your word will come to pass oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
King of the universe
Jesus You have the final say
For we have seen Your faithfulness
You are Who You say You are oh oh oh oh
