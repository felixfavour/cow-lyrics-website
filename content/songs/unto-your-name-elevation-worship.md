Love undeserved and unheard of
As Majesty left Heaven's throne
Your riches exchanged for a cross You carried for us
Matchless in gracious compassion
Mighty in power to save
Clothed in the sorrows of sin
For the glory of our God, for the glory of our God
Unto Your name
Jesus on high, be glorified
No other name
Jesus alone, Savior of all
Love undeserved and unheard of
As Majesty left Heaven's throne
Clothed in the sorrows of sin
For the glory of our God, for the glory of our God
Unto Your name
Jesus on high, be glorified
No other name
Jesus alone, Savior of all
