No longer I who live, but Christ in me
For I've been born again, my heart is free
The hope of Heaven before me, the grave behind
Hallelujah, You brought me back to life
I won't forget the moment
I heard You call my name
Out of the grip of darkness
Into the light of grace
Just like Lazarus
Oh, You brought me back to life
And where there was dead religion
Now there is living faith
All of my hope and freedom
Are found in Jesus' name
Just like Lazarus
Oh, You brought me back to life
No longer I who live, but Christ in me
For I've been born again, my heart is free
The hope of Heaven before me, the grave behind
Hallelujah, You brought me back to life
When something says I am guilty
I'll point to the price You paid
When something says I'm not worthy
I'll point to that empty grave
Just like Lazarus
Oh, You brought me back to life
No longer I who live, but Christ in me
For I've been born again, my heart is free
The hope of Heaven before me, the grave behind
Hallelujah, You brought me back to life
How can I begin to thank You
For all that You've done for me?
Jesus, to fully praise You
It will take all eternity
Just like Lazarus
Oh, You brought me back to life
Oh, You brought me back to life
Oh, You brought me back to life, yeah
Oh, You brought me back to life
No longer I who live, but Christ in me
For I've been born again, my heart is free
The hope of Heaven before me, the grave behind
Hallelujah, You brought me back to life
No longer I who live, but Christ in me
For I've been born again, my heart is free
The hope of Heaven before me, the grave behind
Hallelujah, You brought me back to life
Oh, You brought me back to life
Hey
And the enemy thought he had me
But Jesus said, "You are mine"
Oh, the enemy thought he had me
But Jesus said, "You are mine"
The enemy thought he had me
But Jesus said, "You are mine"
The enemy thought he had me
(But Jesus said, "You are mine") Oh yes, He did
The enemy thought he had me
(But Jesus said, "You are mine") Jesus said, "You are mine"
The enemy thought he had me
But Jesus said, "You are mine"
The enemy thought he had me
(But Jesus said, "You are mine")
(The enemy thought he had me)
(But Jesus said, "You are mine") Oh, come on
The enemy thought he had me
But Jesus said, "You are mine"
(The enemy thought he had me)
But Jesus said ("You are mine")
No longer I who live, but Christ in me
For I've been born again, my heart is free
The hope of Heaven before me, the grave behind
Hallelujah, You brought me back to life
