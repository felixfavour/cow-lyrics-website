Behold Him now
The King has entered in
Behold Him now
The weight of glory here
As He arrives in victory
Open your eyes to majesty
Behold Him now
Behold Him now
King of heaven
We bow in reverence
As the train of Your robe
Fills this temple
As the train of Your robe
Fills this temple
[Spontaneous]
Oh come and fill this place
Come and have Your way God
Behold Him now
The elders gather round
Wе join them now
Laying down our earthly crowns
‘Cause Hе is enthroned in victory
We open our hearts up to receive
