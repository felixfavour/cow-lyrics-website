[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
The mountains standing in Your strength
The oceans roaring out Your praise
All creation glorifies Your name
The angels bow before Your throne
The Heaven shine for You alone
[Pre-Chorus]
All creation glorifies Your name
All creation glorifies Your name
Singing
"Holy, Holy
Holy is the Lord
Almighty, Worthy
All the earth is filled with Your glory, glory
We give You glory, glory"
