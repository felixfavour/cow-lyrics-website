Ayy, Baba
Highly Spiritual
Everybody, dance with me, ha
Let's praise the Lord together
Let everyone everywhere
Shout the name of Jesus, say
From every tribe, (Yah-yah)
Every tongue
Praise Him for His goodness, say
Let everyone (Everywhere)
Everywhere (Shout the name)
Shout the name (Ah)
Of Jesus (From every tribe)
From every tribe (Every tongue, yeah)
Every tongue (Hallelujah!)
Praise Him for His goodness (Whoa! Everybody, sing, say!)
Lord, You are faithful (Lord, You're wonderful)
Lord, You are wonderful (For who You are)
For who You are, we worship You (let's go!)
I can't stop praising You
I can't stop loving You (The more I praise You, Lord)
The more I praise You, Lord (Hey)
The more I see Your blessing (I can't stop praising)
