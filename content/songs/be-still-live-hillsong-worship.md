Be still and know
That the Lord is in control
Be still my soul
Stand and watch as giants fall
I won't be afraid 'cause You are here
You silence all my fear
I won't be afraid, You don't let go
Be still my heart and know
I won't be afraid
Be still and trust
What the Lord has said is done
Find rest, don't strive
Watch as faith and grace align
I won't be afraid, You are here
You silence all my fear
I won't be afraid, You don't let go
Be still my heart and know
I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
