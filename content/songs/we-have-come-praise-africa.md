We have come
Just to praise
Our awesome Father
In this place
It's His love
That makes us sing
He's become
Our everything
So let us dance before Him
And make a joyful noise
So let us shout aloud
For He is our delight
He's the giver of new life
Awesome Father
It's You we praise
Precious Jesus
In this place
Holy Spirit, Holy Fire
Help us lift His name up higher
Praise
Almighty God
We have come (we have come)
Just to praise (just to praise)
Our awesome Father
In this place
