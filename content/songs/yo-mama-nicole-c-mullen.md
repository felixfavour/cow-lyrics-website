Your mama so cool like a gentle breeze
Blowin on a summer day
Your mama got a way of sayin things
That would chase all my pain away
I remember times
She looked me in the eyes
And tell me I could win
'Cuz when nobody else would take the time
To care about a broken hearted kid
Your mama did
Your mama so strong
She could sure lift the troubles
Right out of me
Your mama had a way of carvin out
What I was supposed to be
Sometimes she would scold me
Stand up for me boldly
Challenge me to win
'Cuz when nobody else would take the time
To care about a broken hearted kid
Your mama did
