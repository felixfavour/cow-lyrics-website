(feat. Deitrick Haddon)
There is power in the name of Jesus, there is power in the name of the Lord. There is power in the name of yeshuwa to break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
There is power in the name of Jesus. (x3) to Break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. (x2)
Awesome, vision, sacrifice. So freely given such a price. For our redemption Heavens gates swing wide
There is power in the name of Jesus. (x3) Break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
Break it up, break it up
There is power in the name of Jesus. (x3) Break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
Break it up break it up break it up
Everything is done undone. There's an army rising up, there's an army rising up. Break every chain, break every chain, break every chain(.x2)
Oh oh oh (x3)
There is power in the name of jesus(x3) to break every chain break every chain break every chain
There is power in the name of Jesus, there is power in the name of the Lord. There is power in the name of yeshuwa to break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
