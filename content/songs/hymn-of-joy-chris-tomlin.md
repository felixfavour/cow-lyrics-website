Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee
God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Opening to the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light of day
Rejoice, rejoice!
Emmanuel
Your love has come
Here to dwell
All Thy works with joy surround Thee
Earth and heaven reflect thy rays
Stars and angels sing around Thee
Center of unbroken praise
Field and forest, vale and mountain
Flowâ€™ry meadow, flashing sea
Singing bird and flowing fountain
Call us to rejoice in Thee
