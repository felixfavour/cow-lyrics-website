[Intro: Kirk Franklin, 
TobyMac
]
Yo, turn me up in my microphone
So I can bless God's people
You know Kirk Franklin and then
TobyMac on this gospel train 
(I got)
On the J-Train, ain't nothin' but a thing 
(I got)
Come on and lift up your hands
If you want to get on board
Baby, baby 
(I got)
(I got a ticket to ride to the other side)
[Chorus: Kirk Franklin, 
TobyMac
]
I got a ticket
 (Uh)
I got a ticket
 (Say what, say what)
I got a ticket to ride
 (Uh)
(I got a ticket to ride to the other side)
 (Come on)
I got a ticket
 (Say what, say what) 
(You got a what?)
I got a ticket
 
(Wha-wha-wha-what)
I got a ticket to ride
 (Uh, if you don't know, now you know)
Toby!
[Post-Chorus: TobyMac, 
Kirk Franklin

Ride, ride, wanna ride on the J-Train 
(That's right)
On the J-Train, wanna ride on the J-Train 
(That's right)
Ride, ride, wanna ride on the J-Train 
(That's right)
On the J-Train, wanna ride on the J-Train 
(Come on)
