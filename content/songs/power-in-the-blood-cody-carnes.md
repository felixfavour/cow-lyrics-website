Are you searching for a Savior?
Is there healing that you need?
Is your heart completely broken?
Have you lost yourself in grief?
Are you buried in depression?
Are you longing for some peace?
Is your past a weight you carry?
Are you desperate to be free?
There is power, power
Wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power
Wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There's no burden He can't carry
There's no life He can't redeem
There's no darkness He can't light up (Oh, no no no no)
There's no captive He won't free
