Saved by Your mercy
Found in Your grace
Totally surrendered to Your embrace
And there's nothing more than You
See Your perfection
I'm lost in Your peace
Your faithfulness sings over me
And Your love is the light of my soul
And I lift my eyes to You
Creator of the world
And I stand in awe of You
Of Your glory
And I live to worship You
Son of God, King of Heaven
King of Heaven, Jesus
I am saved by Your mercy
Saved by Your mercy
Found in Your grace
Totally surrendered to Your embrace
And there's nothing more than You
See Your perfection
I'm lost in Your peace
Your faithfulness sings over me
And Your love is the light of my soul
