Ah, take a look
You will see what He’s done
In my life, victory
He has won it all, uh
I’m amazed, it’s crazy
How He’s kept me
Won’t leave me alone
Evidence of His love, is Who I am, ha
Confident, He’ll hold me up in His hand, yeah
All I need, He is faithful to supply it
No denyin' that, uh
Everything I need for Him is easy
And this blows my mind every time
I think, so I’ll just sing
La-la-la-la (Woo, I’ll just sing)
La-la-la-la (Oh, it's my love song to you, woo)
La-la-la-la
And it blows my mind every time
I think, so I’ll just sing
La-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la (Ah)
La-la-la-la (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
La-la-la-la (And it blows my mind, ay)
It blows my mind, so I’ll just sing
La-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la (La-la-la-la)
And it blows my mind every time
I think, so I’ll just sing
