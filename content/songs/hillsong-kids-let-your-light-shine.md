Creep creep in the dark it comes
blow out all your lights

let your light shine woah ohh ohh ohh
let your light shine woah ohh ohh
let your light shine and let Jesus  shine through you
giant fears are really small
when all you see is God don't be afraid to stand up tall and give a great big shout
let your light shine woah ohh ohh ohh
let your light shine woah ohh ohh
let your light shine and let Jesus shine through you
cause I'm not scared I'm gonna let my light shine and you're not scared cos you're gonna let your light shine we're not scared we're gonna let our light shine Jesus is LORD and he's gonna let his light shine
let your light shine woah ohh ohh ohh let your light shine woah ohh ohh
 let your light shine and let Jesus shine through you
let your light shine woah ohh ohh ohh let your light shine woah ohh ohh  let your light shine and let Jesus shine through you
