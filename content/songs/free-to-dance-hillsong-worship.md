This song in my heart
This song in my soul
This song I was born to sing
It's Your song of freedom
Now I'm free to dance again
I'll sing in the darkness
I'll laugh in the rain
Rejoice in Your love again
It's Your song of freedom
Now I'm free to dance again
Your spirit brings me liberty
Your breath of life has set me free
This song in my heart
This song in my soul
This song I was born to sing
It's Your song of freedom
Now I'm free to dance again
I'll sing in the darkness
I'll laugh in the rain
Rejoice in Your love again
It's Your song of freedom
Now I'm free to dance again
