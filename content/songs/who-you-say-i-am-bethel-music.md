Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me
I was lost but He brought me in
Oh His love for me
Oh His love for me
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
And I'm a child of God
Yes I am
Free at last, He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Woah, He died for me
Who the Son sets free
Oh is free indeed
And I'm a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
And I'm a child of God
Yes I am
