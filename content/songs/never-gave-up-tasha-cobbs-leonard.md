Felt like the walls were closing in
Hard to believe this ain’t the end
I was hard pressed
Broken
Hopeless
But then...
You called me by name
Beckoned me to come
Gave me living water
You covered me with love
You silenced the shame
You kept Your arms wide open
And You never gave up
(You waited so patiently)
It was hard some days to love myself
Couldn’t find the words for what I felt
I was depressed
Wounded
Helpless
But then
