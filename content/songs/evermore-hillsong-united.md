Lost for words with all to say
Lord You take my breath away
Still my soul my soul cries out
For You are holy
And as I look upon Your name
Circumstances fade away
And now Your glory steals my heart
For You are holy
[Pre-Chorus]
You are holy
You are holy Lord
Evermore my heart my heart will say
Above all I live for Your glory
Even if my world falls I will say
Above all I live for Your glory
