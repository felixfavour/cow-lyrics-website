See
If I tell you say na you I dey think of when You call
If I tell You say I no forget You at all at all
You no go believe wetin I dey talk
Cause everyday if I remember you smile dey come my face
Day by day January to December you dey for my prayers
So make you believe me wetin I dey talk
Cause you’re always on my mind
Always on my mind
You are always on my mind yes you are
Always on my mind
If I tell you say I dey with you through your ups and downs
If I tell You say I dey with You even if I’m not around
Se You go believe wetin I dey talk
Cause in this our case
Out of sight no be out of mind
And by God’s grace
One day we go dey together just like old times
Se you dey feel everything I talk
And you’re always on my mind
No forget you're always on my mind
You are always on my mind yes you are aee
Always on my mind my mind yea ehhh
You are always on my mind yes you are
Always on my mind you're always on
You’re always on my mind i no forget you at all at all yes you are
Always on my mind
Before You go away
There’s one more thing I must tell You
Se You tell me say
Na the love of God dey compel You
And me I believe wetin You talk
So just in case just in case whatever you do make You no forget
If I seem to fail seem to fail don’t you blame my heart blame my head
Hope say You feel wetin I dey talk
But you're always on my mind you’re always on my mind
Always on my mind ey yeah wooh wooh wooh wooh uuh wooh
