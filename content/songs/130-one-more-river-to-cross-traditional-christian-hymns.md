I’ve Had A Lot Of Troubles And Trials,
In My Little Life’s Span. When I’m Standing Along And The Battle Gets Hard, I Always Do The Best I Can.
I’ve Crossed A Million Valleys, Shed A Million Tears. But When I Come To The 

River Of Jordan Hallelujah, Then I’ll Have No Fears, Then I’ll Have No Fears.

One More River To Cross, One More Mountain To Climb. One More Valley That I’ve Got To Go Through, Leaving My Troubles Behind. One More Battle With The Devil, Then I Know He’ll understand.

I’m Going Through With Jesus Hallelujah, Holding To His Nail Scarred Hands, Holding To His Nail Scarred Hands.

There’s Been A Lot Of People Talked About Me, Since I Walked This Narrow Way. But This Is Just Another Little Valley, I Came Through It When I Prayed. I’ve Climbed A Lot Of High Mountains, Crossed A Lot Of Little 

Streams, When I See Old Jordan Cold And Dark, That’ll Be The Last For Me, That’ll Be The Last For Me.
