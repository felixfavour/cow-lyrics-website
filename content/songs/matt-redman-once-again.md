tt Redman - Once Again
Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice
You became nothing, poured out to death
Many times I've wondered at Your gift of life
I'm in that place once again
I'm in that place once again
And once again I look upon the cross where You died
I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside
Once again I thank You
Once again I pour out my life
Now You are exalted to the highest place
King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow
But for now I marvel at Your saving grace
I'm full of praise once again
I'm full of praise once again
And once again I look upon the cross where You died
I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside
Once again I thank You
Once again I pour out my life
Once again I look upon the cross where You died
I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside
Once again I thank You
Once again I pour out my life
And I thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross, my friend
Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross
I thank You for the cross, my friend
Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross, my friend
Thank You for the cross
Thank You for the cross
I thank You for the cross, my friend
Thank You, Jesus I thank You, Jesus I thank You for the cross
