From the highest throne
To the earth below
You laid down Your life
For the likes of us
Great is the love of the Saviour
From a wounded heart
To a life made whole
Every human heart
Will declare as one
Great is the love of the Saviour
Lord of endless light
Let Your glory shine forever
All the earth
All the earth
Sing Your praise
Hope of every heart
Let Your Name be lifted higher
All our hearts
All our hearts
Sing Your praise
