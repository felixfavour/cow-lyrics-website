[Instrumental]
And I've got a river of living water
A fountain that never will run dry
It's an open heaven You're releasing
And we will never be denied
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're stirring up deep, deep wells
We're stirring up deep, deep waters
We're gonna dance in the river, dance in the river
'Cause we're stirring up deep, deep wells
We're stirring up deep, deep waters
We're gonna jump in the river, jump in the river
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
The deep cries out, the deep cries out to You
We cry out, and we cry out to You, You, Jesus
And I've got a river of living water
A fountain that never will run dry
It's an open heaven You're releasing
And we will never be denied
