You are still my first love
And all I am is Yours
You are still my anchor
Forever I'm secure
You are still my first  love
You're my guiding light
You're with me in the fire
And You lead me through the night
[Pre-Chorus]
You have my heart
You've won my heart
Oh how I love You, Jesus
You are my greatest joy
How I adore You, Jesus
Oh, my soul rejoice
You are still my first love
And all I'm longing for
You'll always be the fortress
My shelter in the storm
