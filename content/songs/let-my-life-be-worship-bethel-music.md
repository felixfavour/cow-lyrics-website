This moment is holy and I hear You calling
I turn my face towards You and my heart is open
You're always pursuing and my life's surrendered
You have my affection
[Chorus: Jenn Johnson]
So let my life be worship
And let my heart stay true
May my love never grow cold
May it burn forevermore
May my life be worship to You
Oh-oh-oh
Ayy
In blessing, in sorrow, in the ordinary
Whatever the cost is, You're always worthy
My heart's cry and my whole life is for Your glory
You have my attention
[Chorus: Michaela Gentile & Jenn Johnson]
So let my life be worship
Let my heart stay true
May my love never grow cold
May it burn forevermore
Let my life be worship to You
