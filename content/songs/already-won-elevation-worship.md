Welcome to a place
Where rejoicing reigns
Cause our God is great
And greatly to be praised
Tell it all around
That it's going down
Cause our God is great
And greatly to be praised
[Pre-Chorus]
Turn it up
Till the walls are shaking
We're ready now
Come alive in the name of Jesus
Now the party has begun
Come and celebrate this love
Cause our God already won
Now we're dancing
To the sound of freedom
Lift your voice and sing
If you've been redeemed
Cause our God is great
And greatly to be praised
