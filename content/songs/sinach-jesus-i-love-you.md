Jesus, I love you
Shepherd of my soul
Jesus, I love you
Your presence makes me whole
Jesus, I love you
Shepherd of my soul
Jesus, I love you
Your presence makes me whole
Your presence is comforting, is healing
Your embrace calms my heart
Your presence is power, is peace of mind
Your joy fills my heart
There's no place like your presence, my Lord
We worship you
We give you praise
No place like your presence
No place like your presence
Oh we wave our hands to you,
We lift our hearts to you
For we love you
Thank you for your love
Jesus, I love you
Shepherd of my soul
Jesus, I love you
Your presence makes me whole
Jesus, I love you
Shepherd of my soul
Jesus, I love you
Your presence makes me whole
Your presence is comforting, is healing
Your embrace calms my heart
Your presence is power, is peace of mind
Your joy fills my heart
There's no place like your presence, my Lord
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
Jesus, Jesus
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
Jesus, Jesus
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you

Your presence is comforting, is healing
Your embrace calms my heart
Your presence is power, is peace of mind
Your joy, your joy, your joy, your joy fills my heart
There's no place like your presence
Nowhere, no place, nowhere Lord like your presence
Nobody, not my mom, not my father, not anyone that I love
No place like your presence
There's no place like your presence, my Lord
