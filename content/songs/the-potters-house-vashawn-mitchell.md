In case you have fallen by the wayside of life
Dreams and visions shattered
You are broken inside
You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in
The potter wants to put you back together again
In case your situation has turned upside down
And all that you've accomplished
Is now on the ground
You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in
The potter wants to put you back together again
Oh, the potter wants
To put you back together again
(Repeat Verse)
Chorus:
You who are broken, stop by... the Potter's house
You who demanded, stop by... the Potter's house
Give him the fragments of your broken life
(Oh-oh-oh)
You who are broken, stop by... the Potter's house
You who demanded, stop by... the Potter's house
Give him the fragments of your broken life
My friend, the potter wants
To put you back together again
Oh, the potter wants
To put you back together again
