We've got a new life
In the light of your love
Called by name
To the saviour of all
We've got a new song
Generations will sing
We've got a new hope
All because of the cross
Saved by the grace
You have given to us
We've got a new song
All the nations will sing
For your name
Shines in all the earth
Great above our lives
Light of our salvation
For your glory
We will give all we are
All our lives
For the love of your son
We've got a new song
Now that we are redeemed
