The splendor of a King
clothe in majesty
let all the earth rejoice
let all the earth rejoice
He wraps Himself in Light
And darkness tries to hide
and trembles at His voice
trembles at His voice
How great is our God
sing with me
How great is our God
and all will see
how great
how great is our God
From age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end
The God head three in one
Father Spirit Son
Lion and the Lamb
Lion and the Lamb
How great is our God
sing with me
How great is our God
Oh we see
How great
how great is our God
Name above all names.    [how great in background]
you are worthy of all praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God
Name above all names     [how great in background]
you are worthy of all praise
My heart will sing
How great is ourGod
How great is our God
sing with me
How great is our God
Oh we see
How great,
How great is our God
How great is our God
sing with me
How great is our God
Oh we see
How great,
How great is our God
How great is our God
sing with me
How great is our God
Oh we see
How great,
How great is our God
