Mighty warrior, sovereign King
You win every battle, even in the shadows
Gentle Father, rich in love
You clothe the orphans and double their portions
Roaring waters, rushing wind
Running like a fountain, moving every mountain
Great Jehovah, the architect
Alpha and Omega, Holy Way Maker
Unto the Great I Am
With everything I have
Unto the Great I Am
I'm singing how great Your name
Unto the Great I Am
With everything I have
Unto the Great I Am
I'm singing how great Your name
Wonderworker, bread of life
Your body was broken, heaven tore open
Now resurrected and lifted high
Risen Messiah, glory in the highest
