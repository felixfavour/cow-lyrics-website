Oh Your name, is my first defense
And Oh Your name, is my last amen
It carries me when I cannot stand
It reaches me when I reach the end
Jesus Your name, when the whole world shakes
Jesus Your name, I will ever praise
My battle cry every night and day
I'll sing Your name over everything
I'll sing Your name over everything
Oh, Your name, is my greatest strength
It fights for me and it won't relent
I cast my cares, every burden fall
For there's one name that can bear them all
Jesus Your name, when the whole world shakes
Jesus Your name, I will ever praise
My battle cry every night and day
I'll sing Your name over everything
I'll sing Your name over everything
In every storm, You're the Prince of Peace
The Lord of all, You are Heaven's King
I'll sing Your name till my last breath here
Then I'll sing again with my first breath there
Jesus Your name, when the whole world shakes
Jesus Your name, I will ever praise
My battle cry every night and day
I'll sing Your name over everything
Oh yes, I'll sing Your name over everything
Jesus, I'll sing Your name over everything
My God, I'll sing Your name over everything
