So many hopes and dreams
I can think of a thousand things
That I am waiting for
That I'm still praying for
But that doesn't compromise
You're my hope and my hope's alive
You will not leave me in need
Jesus is willing
Jesus is here now
Jesus won't fail me
He doesn't know how
Be thou my vision
When I see no way out
I have no doubt
You will make a way
In the middle of the mystery
Nothing's clear like I'd hoped it'd be
I remember who You've always been to me
Always doing what You said You'd do
Every miracle goes to prove
You will not leave me in need
