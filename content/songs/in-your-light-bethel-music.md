In Your light I find my strength
And in Your truth I overcome
And in Your grace I lose myself
For in Your love...
You've turned my tears of sadness
Into such joy and gladness
My heart can't keep it in
I'm shouting, shouting
You've turned my tears of sadness
Into such joy and gladness
My heart can't keep it in
I'm shouting, shouting
And in Your joy I find my strength
And in Your hope I overcome
And in Your grace I lose myself
For in Your love...
You've turned my tears of sadness
Into such joy and gladness
My heart can't keep it in
I'm shouting, shouting
