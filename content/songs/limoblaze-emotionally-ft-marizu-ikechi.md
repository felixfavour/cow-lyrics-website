I de  get emotionally oh
See as e de ginger me
Your love e just de ginger me Your love e too de ginger me
 Ai Ta parole dans mon coeur (your word in my heart)
M'a délivré de mes douleurs (has delivered me from my pain)
Tu as effacé mes torts (you have erased my mistakes)
Brisé les chaÃ®nes de ma mort (broken i the chains of my death)
