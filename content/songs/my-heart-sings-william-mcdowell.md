How could I describe
A God that’s indescribable
How could explain
A love that’s unexplainable
I’m at a loss for words
[Chorus:]
Oh Oh Oh My heart sings Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh My heart sings Oh Oh Oh
How can I describe
A God that’s indescribable
How can explain
A love that’s unexplainable
I’m at a loss for words
[Chorus:]
Oh Oh Oh My heart sings Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh My heart sings Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh My heart sings Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh My heart sings Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh My heart sings Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh My heart sings Oh Oh Oh
