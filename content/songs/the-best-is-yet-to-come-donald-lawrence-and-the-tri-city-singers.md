Hold on, my brother
Don't give up
Hold on, my sister
Just look up
There is a master plan
In store for you
If you just make it through
God's gonna really
Blow your mind
He's gonna make it
Worth your time
For all of the trouble
You've been through
The blessings doubled
Just for you
The best is yet to come
Today is the first day
Of the best days of
Your life
You ain't seen nothing yet
