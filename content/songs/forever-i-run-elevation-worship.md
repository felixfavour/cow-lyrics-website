Here I lay my life down
To be found, found in You
Here I empty myself
To be filled, again with You
[Pre-Chorus]
Over and over again
Over and over again
You are, the strength of my heart
Forever I'll run, again to Your love
You are, the strength of my heart
Forever my God, Your love is enough!
There's no treasure on earth
That compares to who You are
I surrender it all
Just to know, know You more
[Pre-Chorus]
Over and over again
Over and over again!...
