We won't keep quiet
We won't be ashamed
We'll keep confessing
Jesus you reign
No matter how long
We'll keep on praying Thee
Nothing can stop you
You will remain always
You stand forever
Stand forever
Stand forever
Stand forever
We won't keep quiet
We won't be ashamed
We'll keep confessing
Jesus you reign
No matter how long
We'll keep on praying Thee
Nothing can stop you
You will remain always
You stand forever
Stand forever
Stand forever
Stand forever
You stand forever
Stand forever
Stand forever
Stand forever
We won't stop
Calling your name, calling your name
We won't quit
Seeking your face, seeking your face
We won't stop
Calling your name, calling your name
We won't quit
Seeking your face, seeking your face
We won't stop
Calling your name, calling your name
We won't quit
