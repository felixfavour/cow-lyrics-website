[Intro: Benjamin William Hastings]
One, two
One, two, three, four, five, six
Your word is a lamp unto my feet
Your way is the only way for me
It's a narrow road that leads to life
But I wanna be on it
It's a narrow road, but the mercy's wide
'Cause You're good on Your promise
[Chorus: Aodhan King & Benjamin William Hastings]
I'll take You at Your word
If You said it, I'll believe it
I've seen how good it works
If You start it, You'll complete it
I'll take You at Your word
Oh, You spoke and the chaos fell in line
Oh, I know 'cause I've seen it in my life
It's a narrow road that leads to life
But I want to be on it, yeah
It's a narrow road and the tide is high
But You're partin' the water
