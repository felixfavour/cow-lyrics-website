Never would have made it
Never could have made it, without you
I would have lost it all
But now I see how you were there for me
And I can say
Never would have made it
Never could have made it without you
I would have lost it all
But now I see how you were there for me and I can say
I'm stronger, I'm wiser
I'm better, much better
When I look back over all you brought me through
I can see that you were the one I held on to
And I never, never would have made it
Oh I never could have made it, never could have made it without you
Oh I would have lost it all
Oh but now I see how you were there for me
I never, never would have made it
No, I never, never could have made it without you
I would have lost my mind a long time ago
If it had not been for you
I am stronger, I am stronger
I am wiser, now I'm better
So much better
I made it through my storm
And my test because you were there
To carry me through my mess
I am stronger, I am stronger
I am wiser, I am wiser
I am better, I am better
Anybody better, I am better
I can stand here and tell you
I made it
Anybody out there that you made it
I am stronger, I am stronger
I am wiser, I am wiser
I am better, I am better
Much better, I am better
I made it, I made it
I made it, I made it
I made it, I made it
I made it, I made it
Never would have made it, never would have made it
Never could have made it, never could have made it without you
I would have lost my mind
I would have gave up
But you were right there
You were right there
I never, never would have made it
Oh I never, never could have made it without you
Somebody just need to testify to someone next to 'em
Tell 'em I am stronger
I am wiser
I am better, much better
When I look back over what he brought me through
I realize I made it because I had you to hold on to
Now I am stronger
Now I am wiser
I am better, so much better
I made it
Is there anybody in this house other than me that can
Declare that you made it
Tell your neighbor
Never would have made it, never would have made it
Tell 'em never could have made it, never could have made it without you
I wish I had some help here
I wish I had just two or three people
That would just declare it
Never would have made it, never would have made it
Never could have made it, never could have made it without you
I just, I just love to encourage myself
Sometimes I just look in the mirror and say;
I am stronger
I am wiser
I am better, so much better
When I look back over what he brought me through
I realize I made it because I had you to hold on to
But I never would have made it
I never could have made it without you
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh I, good God almighty
Never would have made it, never would have made it
Never could have made it, never could have made it without you
Sing it one more time
All I need is it one more time
Everybody sing with me
Never would have made it
Never could have made it without you
