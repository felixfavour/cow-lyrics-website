I'd rather have the wilderness if You are by my side
Than wander in the Promised Land alone
So I will watch the cloud by day and follow fire by night
Wherever You'd go I will go
Your presence is my inheritance
What more could I want?
And Your spirit is my portion, Lord
What more could I want?
I'd rather be a vagabond with You inside my heart
Than dwell in all the mansions of the world
I lay down all my treasure, I'd give up all I own
To follow wherever You go, oh, oh-oh
And Your presence is my inheritance
What more could I want?
And Your spirit is my portion, Lord
What more could I want?
[Bridge]
You are my hope, where else would I go?
I wanna walk with You, Jesus
Dwell in Your nearness
Lord, where else would I go?
I wanna walk with You, Jesus
Dwell in Your nearness
And dwell in Your nearness, oh
