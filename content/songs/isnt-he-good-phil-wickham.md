[Intro]
(Isn't He worthy? Isn't He worthy?)
(Isn't He worthy? Isn't He worthy?)
I was lost and He found me
I was sick and He healed me
I was dead and He raised me up again
I was bound and He freed me
Now I stand in His victory
I was desperate and He saved me from my sin
Isn't He good? Isn't He great? Isn't He faithful?
Look at my life, look what He's done, isn't He able?
Isn't He good? Isn't He great? Isn't He worthy?
Oh, He's worthy, He's worthy, isn't He?
Mighty God, Jehovah
Holy One, Messiah
All the glory to our rеsurrected King, yeah
Isn't Hе good? Isn't He great? Isn't He faithful?
Look at my life, look what He's done, isn't He able?
Isn't He good? Isn't He great? Isn't He worthy?
Oh, He's worthy, He's worthy, isn't He?
