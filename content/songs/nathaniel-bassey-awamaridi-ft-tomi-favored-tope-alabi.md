yeah.....oooooh
 you're the beginning,ending
alpha and omega.
you're seated in the circle of the earth.
 you're the God who made the universe out of void and emptiness
you spoke the word and it fell into place
you're deeper than my mind can grasp and what my eyes can see
eternity won't be enough to tell of you
as long as I've got breath in me and to the great beyond, I'll declare the greatness of your name
awamaridi... awamaridi oooh
you're a mystery revealed to me ooooh
so I've come to worship you
I've come to worship you.
Verse 2
The heavens of the heavens cannot contain your majesty and yet you've made my heart your dwelling place.
I find it hard to understand the reason for this kind of love
for mortal men who sometimes doesn't care...
You took the  journey to the cross and never looking back
You died the sinner's death so I can live again
if this is not the greatest love, I wonder what it is
I can only take a God who is like you
Jesus... Awamaridi... awamaridi oooh
