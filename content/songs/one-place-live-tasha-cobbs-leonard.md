[Chorus: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
This song just says...
In one place, in one tabernacle with Jesus
In one place, in one tabernacle with Jesus
There is no other place
Where I'd, I'd Rather be
Than in one place, in one tabernacle with Him
[Chorus: Pastor Bertha Cobbs, 
Tasha Cobbs Leonard
, 
Pastor Bertha Cobbs & Tasha Cobbs Leonard
]
In one place, in one tabernacle with Jesus (
Jesus
)
In one place, in one tabernacle with Jesus (
Jesus
)
There is no (
No
) other place (
No other place
)
Where I'd rather be
Than in 
one place, in one tabernacle with Him
(Come on somebody, lift your hands in the room)
I'm here because I wanna be
I'm here because I choose to be
I'm here because I love to be, in Your presence
I'm here because I wanna be
I'm here because I choose to be
I'm here because I love to be, in Your presence
And I find peace here, I find joy here
All I need is here, in Your presence
And I find peace here, I find joy here
All I need is here, in Your presence
