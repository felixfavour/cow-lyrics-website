Let's go to the enemy's camp 
To take back what the devil has stolen.
Let's go to the enemy's camp 
To proclaim our liberty.

Jesus is the rock
Jesus is the rock 
Jesus is the rock
Jesus is the rock 

Show me the good good things
That God cannot do
Show me the good good houses that God cannot give.
Show me the good good jobs
That God cannot give 
You just show me the good good children 
That God cannot give 

That's the reason why 
I sing the way I do 
That's the reason why 
I dance the way I do 

Cos I believe 

I believe I believe I believe I believe I believe I believe

Yes I believe 

I believe I believe I believe I believe I believe I believe

Way! We got to do it the Holy Ghost way 
We got to do it the Holy Ghost way

Way! we got to do it the Holy Ghost way 
We got to do it the Holy Ghost way

Way! We got to do it the Holy Ghost way 
We got to do it the Holy Ghost way

Way! we got to do it the Holy Ghost way 
We got to do it the Holy Ghost way

Holy Ghost style in a Holy Ghost style

We got to pull down the walls of iniquity 
At the shout of the name of Jesus 

Say we got to pull down the walls of hatred 
At the shout of the name of Jesus 

We got to pull down the walls of sickness 
At the shout of the name of Jesus 

We got to pull down the walls of failure 
At the shout of the name of Jesus 

Way! We got to do it the Holy Ghost way 
We got to do it the Holy Ghost way 

Anywhere you see God's children them are go oo
You got to leave them alone
