I need You
I need You now
More than ever before
Each day more and more
I can't go on without You
I need You
I need You
I need You now
More than ever before
Each day more and more
I can't go on without You
I need You
I'm hungry
I'm thirsty
I'm desperate for You
Lord touch me, fulfill my desire
I long to be near You
My heart's beating for You
Draw me and fold me
Consume me, consume me
I'm lost without You in my life
I need You
I need You now
More than ever before
Each day more and more
I can't go on without You
I need You
