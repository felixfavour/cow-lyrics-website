The way You love me
No one can ever love me that way
Help me to see me
From the lens of Your heart
I'm forever Yours
And I will sing of Your love
And Everything, You mean to me
The way You love me
No one can ever love me that way
Help me to see me
From the lens of Your heart
Cause I'm forever Yours
And I will sing of Your love
Lord And Everything, You mean to me
Chorus:
Kaunar ka, babu kamar sa
(Nothing can be compared to Your love)
Kai ka ba ni, sabon rai kyauta
(You've given me a new life for free)
Rayuwata da komai na
(All that I am and all that I have)
Duk naka ne har abada
(Belongs to You forever)
Lalala lalalala
Lalala lalala
Lalala lalalala
Lalalalala
