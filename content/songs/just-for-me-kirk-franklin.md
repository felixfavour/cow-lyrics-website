[Intro]
You keep on making a way, making a way just for me
You keep on making a way, making a way just for me
You keep on making a way, making a way just for me
Just for me
Many doors You've closed just for me
Sometimes You will say no
So I’ll be tested in Your fire
To purify my desires
So my blessings won't be just for me
So caught up in myself, I couldn't see
The world did not revolve around me
So storms are in Your will
So I can feel what others feel, their needs
If I could speak honestly
It don’t feel good, but growing never does
It don't seem fair for You to call this love
But if necessary pain is the ingredient for change
Even when life may be bittersweet, it's working
Just for me
All the moments I missed that were just for me
Because I chose not to wait patiently
But for every mistake was the same amount of grace
That kept my blessing waiting
Just for me
But trusting Your timing is not easy
And what I want's not always what I need
Somewhere, I forgot, You are God and I am not, I see
If I could speak honestly
