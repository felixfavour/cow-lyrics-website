Oh these days I'm at a distance
Sirens scream but I don't listen
There's a million distractions I can't escape
Like I'm sleepwalking now but I'm wide awake
And the picture I painted I want to change
Right now, right now
Bring me into the conversation
All my world you can see them shaking, yeah
I'm staring at You, hanging on every word You're saying
So bring me into the conversation, oh yeah
One by one we're separated
What I thought was love just looked like hatred
I've been losing myself trying to prove You wrong
And right now all I know is I can't go on
So I'm stepping across all the lines I've drawn
Right now, right now
Bring me into the conversation
All my world You can see them shaking, yeah
I'm staring at You, hanging on every word You're saying
So bring me into the conversation, oh yeah
