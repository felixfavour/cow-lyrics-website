When I think upon Christmas, words can't express
How our Father in heaven has sent us His best
To be born in a manger, the King in the hay
And creation will worship His name
For the joy of the world He was born
Bringing peace to us all through the gift of the Son
Now the darkest of ages are done
For the Saviour of heaven has come
When I think upon Jesus, the King of all days
I can't help but respond with an off'ring of praise
Like the wise men and shepherds, I'll follow Your light
Like the angels, I'll lift Your name high
For the joy of the world You were born
Bringing peace to us all through the gift of Your love
Now the darkest of ages are done
For the Saviour of heaven has come
