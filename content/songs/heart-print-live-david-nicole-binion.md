[Intro: MDSN]
On me
This is not an ordinary love
Passionate enough to bear a cross
Far beyond all I could ever want
Jesus
On me
This is not a thought that comes and goes
It's the air I breathe, the fire in my bones
The greatest power I will ever know
Jesus
On me
[Chorus: MDSN & Travis Greene]
I, I walk a little different now
I, I was lost but in Your love I'm found
More than just a moment, this is my identity
I'm changed, I'm loved, I'm free
You left Your heart print on me, on me
You left Your heart print on me, on me
More than just a temporary change
More than just a mark that fades away
My life will never, ever be the same
Jesus, oh Jesus
