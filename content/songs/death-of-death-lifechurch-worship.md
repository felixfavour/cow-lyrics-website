God and man were crucified
The day the Promised One had died
It seemed that heaven's love had lost
As Jesus hung upon the cross
His broken body laid to rest
As Earth was filled with hopelessness
'Til the son of man began to wake
And the tomb became an empty grave
Oh, the tomb became an empty grave
It was the death of death when You rose to life
When the dark surrendered to the risen Light
O praise the Savior, Jesus Christ
It was the death of death and our victory
The war is won, the work is done
And hope for all the world has come
The victor never lost his crown
'Cause hell and grave can't hold Him down
No, hell and grave can't hold Him down
