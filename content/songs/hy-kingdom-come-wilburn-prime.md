1 Thy kingdom come, O God,
thy rule, O Christ, begin;
break with thine iron rod
the tyrannies of sin.

2 Where is thy reign of peace
and purity and love?
When shall all hatred cease,
as in the realms above?

3 When comes the promised time
that war shall be no more,
and lust, oppression, crime
shall flee thy face before?

4 We pray thee, Lord, arise,
and come in thy great might;
revive our longing eyes,
which languish for thy sight.

5 Men scorn thy sacred name,
and wolves devour thy fold;
by many deeds of shame
we learn that love grows cold. 

6 O'er lands both near and far
thick darkness broodeth yet:
arise, O Morning Star,
arise, and never set!
