[Intro]
Come and have Your way
For we hunger for You
Oh, we hunger for You
Come and move
Come and move
Come alive, come alive, come alive, dry bones
Come alive, come alive, come alive, dry bones
Awake, arise, inhale the light
And come alive, come alive
I'm gonna sing to you, dry bones
Till you're covered in life
And the valleys bloom
Like a rosebud in the light
Hear the call to attention
Feel the change in the air
For the ground is dry
But the clouds are overhead
[Pre-Chorus]
So I'ma sing it again
