I met Jesus in Miami
And He changed me overnight
You can tell me that I'm crazy
But this love I can't deny
I woke up in the city
Supernatural high
Took a trip down to South Beach
Best sunburn of my life
Perfect day for the top down
Cruising Ocean Drive
Missing Liv on a Sunday
But I've never felt so alive
Oh my God
I'm falling in love with You
With You
I met Jesus in Miami
And He changed me overnight
You can tell me that I'm crazy
But this love I can't deny
I don't care what you say about me
I don't care what you think, alright?
I met Jesus in Miami
And you'll never change my mind
ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
ooh oh oh oh oh oh oh
De la playa a mi barrio
95 feeling desesperado
Rush hour got me locked in my lane
Wasting away
Gridlocked in my pain
Hit the crosswalk now I'm changed
Won't forget the day He called my name, yeah
Don't care what I'm missing
FOMO ain't my prison
Here I gotta vision
The party's just beginning
Oh my God
I'm falling in love with You
With You
I met Jesus in Miami
And He changed me overnight
You can tell me that I'm crazy
But this love I can't deny
I don't care what you say about me
I don't care what you think, alright?
I met Jesus in Miami
And you'll never change my mind
Lights are shining in the big, big city
And now You're shining in me
Lights are shining in the big, big city
And now You're shining in me
Lights are shining in the big, big city
And now You're shining in me
Lights are shining in the big, big city
And now You're shining in me
Oh my God
I'm falling in love with You
With You
Oh my God
I'm falling in love with You
With You
I met Jesus in Miami
And you'll never change my mind
