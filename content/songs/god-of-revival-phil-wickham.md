And we've seen what You can do
Oh, God of Wonders
Your power has no end
The things You've done before
In greater measure
You will do again
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's no prison wall You can't break through
No mountain You can't move, all things are possible
And there's no broken body You can't raise
No soul that You can't save, all things are possible
The darkest night
You can light it up
And You can light it up
Oh, God of Revival
Let hope arise
Death is overcome
And You've already won
Oh, God of Revival
