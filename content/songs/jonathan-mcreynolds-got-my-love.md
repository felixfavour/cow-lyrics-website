Got My Love  Jonathan McReynolds
Father, you pursued me, even when I walked away
You put me on this journey and promised me you would stay
You took my dirty laundry and washed it white as snow,
You took what they called ugly, and called it beautiful
You caught my eye
You stole my heart
You Got My Love
Forever for real, God
You caught my eye
You stole my heart
You Got My Love
Forever for real, God
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
How can I repay you
For a whole life time of grace
Your love don't stop on Sunday
Even when i stop my praise
I gave up with these chances
Cos I didn't realize
It's only your mercy that's keeping me alive
You caught my eye
You stole my heart
You Got My Love
Forever for real, God
You caught my eye
You stole my heart
You Got My Love
Forever for real, God
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
I made up my mind to love you for life
The strongest tie is our love
I made up my mind to love you for life
The strongest tie is our love
I made up my mind to love you for life
The strongest tie is our love
I made up my mind to love you for life
The strongest tie is our love
You caught my eye
You stole my heart
You Got My Love
Forever for real, God
You caught my eye
You stole my heart
You Got My Love
Forever for real, God
You caught my eye
You stole my heart
You Got My Love
Forever for real, God
You caught my eye
You stole my heart
You Got My Love
Forever for real
