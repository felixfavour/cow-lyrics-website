all stature of a girl
Small footsteps in the world
Didn't want anyone to see
I just wanted you to be seen
I listen to your words
Every phrase I have heard
Why do you belittle yourself
Don't you know you're killing yourself
Chin up, shoulders back, and stride
Hair down, wear it out with pride
You don't need a crown to be queen
You don't need a stage for a scene
You're the show, the star, the event
start, main, end, and the rest
Telling you what you fail to see
Wondering how you fail to see you're the
Leading lady
Like Mercedes
Should I steer you
Through the gears
Live it louder
Love you prouder
Pushing daisies
Weeping lady
You know me
Acting cozy
Did 180
Acting shady
Mental ruler
Peace intruder
You need me
Bleeding lady
Feeling shaky
Her anxiety
Peaking daily
Hold the worry
Till your eighty
Stage right enter
Front and center
Pretty lady
Say you need me
I can't hear you
Crystal clear
Say it louder
Speak it prouder
Say you're pretty
Leading lady
