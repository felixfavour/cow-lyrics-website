How do I find the right word to say
lord how do I find  enough  Faith to pray
cause all that I have is a wounded heart
I  just wanna find were the healing starts
(chorus) lord,wo oh oo
       I knw am broken, my home  is falling so far
I need u lord to lift me up,. up
Am going in under ,my heart is braking apart
I need  u lord to lift me up .    uoooo.up
    lift me up,
 lord lift me up ooo up
too many battles ,no strength to fight
too many days with no sun light
 all of my questions  no reply
I just wanna feel dis void inside
ohooooo
(chorus)
rap
i've been carring a weight on my shoulders trying not to break while this world's gettin' colder man feeling like no matter how hard i fight i know choas is always ready to strike like a cobra
and when i can't seem to find my way feeling out pf place you show me grace for my mistakes you lift me up and show what you love and i will never find a love, love like this i will never find a love
