Destroy this temple and in three days, I will raise it up [x3]
Early Sunday morning as the noon day was dawning
Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to the tomb
Behold! There was a great earthquake! [x2]
For the angel of the Lord descended from Heaven
The angel of the Lord descended from Heaven [x3]
And rolled, rolled
And rolled
Back the stone
His countenance was like lightening and his raiment was as white as snow. [x3]
And for fear of Him the keepers did shake and became as dead men
Fear not. [x3]
For I know ye seek Jesus who was crucified
He is not here [x4]
For He has risen as he said
Yeah!
See the place where the Lord lay
Fear not. [x3]
For I know ye seek Jesus who was crucified
He is not here [x4]
For He has risen as he said
Yeah!
See the place where the Lord lay
