I will sing for You alone have rescued this life
Jesus, You have set me free
You alone took away all sin and disgrace
When You gave Your life to ransom me
I am forgiven at the foot of the Cross
I am accepted by the power of Your love
My every stain is washed away
I am forgiven
So here I stand in the light of Your glory and grace
Where Heaven's love and justice meet
Now I live for the One who has called me by name
And Who is risen and alive in me
I am forgiven at the foot of the Cross
I am accepted by the power of Your love
My every stain is washed away
I am forgiven
I am forgiven at the foot of the Cross
I am accepted by the power of Your love
My every stain is washed away
I am forgiven
