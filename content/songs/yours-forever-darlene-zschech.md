My life is in Your hands
My times are in Your hands
Though nations shake and thunders roll
I will trust in You completely
I yearn for more of You
Your grace alive in me
My life is nailed to hands that bled
In this love my soul is free
[Chorus: Kari Jobe]
You took my place, You took the fall
You took the nails, that I may live forever, live forever
You rose again, You made a way
You broke the chains and now I'm Yours forever
I'm Yours forever, yeah
We are Yours forever
I worship You forevermore
In joy and suffering
Until the day I see Your face
My whole life to You my offering
[Chorus: Darlene Zschech]
You took my place, You took the fall
You took the nails, that I may live forever, live forever
You rose again, You made a way
You broke the chains and now I'm Yours forever
I'm Yours forever
