God I'm wrestling with the wounds, again
My impatience a disease in this cage for mice and men
They say "Boy you better keep running" but this pace I can't Jesustain
My head knows to trust You but the heart of me is slain
Faithful are the wounds of a friend
Faithful are the dealings of Your hand
The troubles and the trials like the gold refining fire
Faithful are the wounds of a friend
God these questions, that just won't leave me alone
Will this crushing ever end
Or is this ache now my home
Am I a prisoner of hope? But just the warden of my pain
When my head knows to trust You but the heart of me is slain
Faithful are the wounds of a friend
Faithful are the dealings of Your hand
The troubles and the trials like the gold refining fire
Faithful are the wounds of a friend
And faithful are the wounds of a friend
Faithful like the tides pulled by Your hand
I've learned to piece the wage that pushed my soul into a cage
Faithful are the wounds of a friend
