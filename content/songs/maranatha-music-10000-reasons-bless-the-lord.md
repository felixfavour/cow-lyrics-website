Blessed lord oo my soul ooo my soul
worship his holy name,
sing like never before
oo my soul
il worship your holy name
the sun comes up, its a new day downing
its time to sing your song again
what ever may pass and whaatever lies before me
let me be singing when the evening comes
(chorus )
blessed lord oo my soul oo my soul
worship his holy name,
oo my soul
il worship your holy name
your rich in love
and your slow to anger
your name is great , and your heart is kind
for all your goodness i will keep on singing
10, 000 reasons for my heart to find
(chorus) 2
and on that day when my strength is failing
the end draws near and my time has com e
still my soul will sing your praise on ending
10, 000 year and then forever more
FOREVERMORE
(blessed lord oo my soul oo my soul
worship his holy name
sing like never before
oo my soul
il worship your holy name)   2
il worship your holy name.
