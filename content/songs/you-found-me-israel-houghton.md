You found me, You found me
Once I was lost but now I'm found
You loved me, You loved me
You broke the chains that held me down
You healed me, You healed me
Once I was blind but now I see
You freed me, You freed me
With what You did at Calvary
Thank You for the cross
You are stronger than sin, You're the cure for my disease
You are more than enough, more than enough for me
Your grace has made a way for me to say what I believe
I am found, I am loved, I am healed
I am free, I am free
You found me, You found me
Once I was lost but now I'm found
You loved me, You loved me
You broke the chains that held me down
You healed me, You healed me
Once I was blind but now I see
You freed me, You freed me
With what You did at Calvary
Thank You for the cross
