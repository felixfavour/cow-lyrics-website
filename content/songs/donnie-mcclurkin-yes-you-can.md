Listen, gather 'round, I found something that you can use
And if you listen, well, I'm here to tell you, you cannot lose, oh
A simple song, simple melody, yea yea, to remind you that you can be
The greatest ever, defeated never, oh
Even though sometimes you may lose, oh my
Yes you can, you can do anything if you try, just try
Yes you can, but you have to believe and rely on what you have inside
You can make it through your trials, for your trials will just make you strong
You can do anything, yes you can, oh oh oh
Teach your children well, it's time to tell them just who they are, oh oh oh
Train them as they go to let them know that they can go far, oh
Oh my brother why do you wait, now tomorrow just might be too late
For God gave the provision, made the decision, yea
You can do all things through your faith, c'mon you all say
Yes you can, you can do anything if you try, just try
Yes you can, but you have to believe and rely on what you have inside
You can make it through your trials, for your trials will just make you strong
You can do anything, yes you can, oh oh oh
Yes I can, I can do anything if I try, just try
Yes I can, but I have to believe and rely on what I have inside
I can make it through my trials, for my trials will just make me strong
I can do anything, yes I can, oh oh oh
I can, I can, I can, yes I can do anything
I can, I can, I can, yes I can do anything
I can, I can, I can, yes I can do anything
I can, I can, I can, yes I can do anything
No matter what if you can just conceive it
If you believe it, then you can achieve it
No matter what if you can just conceive it
If you believe it, then you can achieve it
