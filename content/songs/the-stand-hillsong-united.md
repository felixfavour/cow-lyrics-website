You stood before creation
Eternity in Your Hand
You spoke the earth into motion
My soul now to stand
You stood before my failure
And carried the cross for my shame
My sin weighed upon Your Shoulders
My soul now to stand
[Pre-Chorus]
So what could I say?
And what could I do?
But offer this heart, Oh God
Completely to You
So I'll walk upon salvation
Your Spirit alive in me
This life to declare Your Promise
My soul now to stand
[Pre-Chorus]
So what could I say?
And what could I do?
But offer this heart, Oh God
Completely to You
So what could I say?
And what could I do?
But offer this heart, Oh God
Completely to You
