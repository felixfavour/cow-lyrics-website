The name of Jesus is a refuge
A shelter from the storm
A help to those who call
The name of Jesus is a fortress
A saving place to run
A hope unshakeable
[Pre-Chorus]
When we fall, You are the Savior
When we call, You are the answer
There is power in Your name
There is power in Your name!
In the name of Jesus
There is life and healing
Chains are broken in Your name
Every knee will bow down
And our hearts will cry out
Songs of freedom in Your name
Oh, in your name!
Bring salvation, bring Your kingdom
Let all that You have made
Bring glory to Your name!
