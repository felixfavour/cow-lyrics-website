[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
For those of you that are going through it
I want you to wipe every tear from your eye, hahahaha
'Cause Jesus said he'd meet us someday, haha
Down by the riverside
Can I get a witness up in here?
It's Friday and my bills are due
My three-month-old baby need some shoes
Can you feel what I'm going through?
Clock on the wall keeps tickin' tockin'
No stoppin' and somebody's knockin'
On the door tellin' me to go (
Lord have mercy
)
Brother, I can't take no mo'
So with my knees I hit the flo'
And say help me Jesus, help me Jesus
(
Well, come on, y'all
)
[Chorus: Choir, 
Kirk Franklin
]
Let's go down by the riverside (
Woo
)
Leave your problems all behind
You can rest your troubled minds
Down by the riverside
[Interlude: Kirk Franklin]
I don't think you heard me the first time
So then why don't I say it one more time
Everybody, Jesus is gon' meet us down there by the riverside
One time for your holy minds
Come on
