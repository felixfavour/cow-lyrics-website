There's not a world of difference
Out in the world tonight
Between this world of people
Red, yellow, black and white
But instead of riding a rainbow of love
We still are fighting with prejudice gloves of anger
With something to claim
But nothing to gain, so
Why can't we be colour blind?
You know we should be living together
And we'd find a reason and rhyme
I know we would
'Cause we could see better
If we could be colour blind
Somebody's just assuming
He's up to nothing good
'Cause he's not like the others
There goes the neighbourhood
What kind of world are we living in
When we judge a man by the tone of his skin
It's crazy
'Cause he has a heart
Like you have a heart and
