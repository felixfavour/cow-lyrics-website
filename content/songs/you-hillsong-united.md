As I pray and wait upon the Lord
I know Your grace
In love I am restored
As I think of all You've done for me
The mystery of Your love
[Pre-Chorus]
Who walked upon the sea
Who lived and died for me
You Lord
You Lord
You are Lord
As I look upon You
I am changed though I fail
Your faithful love remains
As I sing and worship You
I find again no words describe Your love
[Pre-Chorus]
Who watches over me
Whose love has covered me
