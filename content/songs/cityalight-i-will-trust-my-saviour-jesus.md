I will trust my Saviour Jesus
When my darkest doubts befall
Trust Him when to simply trust Him
Seems the hardest thing of all
I will trust my Saviour Jesus
Trust Him when my strength is small
For I know the shield of Jesus
Is the safest place of all

Jesus, only Jesus
Help me trust You more and more
Jesus, only Jesus
May my heart be ever Yours
I will trust my Saviour Jesus
He has said His way is best
And I know the path He's chosen
Leads to everlasting rest
