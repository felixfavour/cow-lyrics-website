[Chorus: Joth Hunt, 
Israel Houghton
]
Through You, I can do anything
I can do all things
For it's You who gives me strength
Nothing is impossible
Through You, blind eyes are opened
Strongholds are broken
I am living by faith
Nothing is impossible
[Interlude: Israel Houghton]
Yeah
Nothing is impossible
Oh-ooh
I'm not gonna live by what I see
I'm not gonna live by what I feel
[Pre-Chorus: Joth Hunt, 
Israel Houghton
]
Deep down I, know that You're here with me
 (
Here with me
)
And I know that You can do anything
[Chorus: Joth Hunt & Israel Houghton]
Through You, I can do anything
I can do all things
For it's You who gives me strength
Nothing is impossible
Through You, blind eyes are opened
Strongholds are broken
I am living by faith
Nothing is impossible
