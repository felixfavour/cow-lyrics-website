[Instrumental]
[Spontaneous]
You're giving us new memories
You're giving us new memories
For all the places shame wrote our story
You're giving us Your memory
It's not just perspective
It's innocence restored
You're giving us Your memories
You're giving us a new memory
You're rewriting our story
Our story with Your love
Unreserved, unrestrained
Your love is wild
Your love is wild for me
It isn't shy, it's unashamed
Your love is proud
To be seen with me
'Cause You don't give Your heart in pieces
And You don't hide Yourself to tease us
