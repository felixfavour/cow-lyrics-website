On a hill, Your blood was spilled
Your brow, Your hands, Your feet
With nails and thorns, the veil was torn
To make a way for me
You made a way for me
Jesus, Savior
My God, my King, my Lord
Jesus, Savior
The victory is Yours
Wrapped and bound, they laid You down
A perfect sacrifice
But in three days, the stone was rolled away
Forever You're alive
Forever You're alive
Jesus, Savior
My God, my King, my Lord
Jesus, Savior
The victory is Yours
The victory is Yours
