Through your story is My fingerprint
In the valley there is confidence
In the shadow, I will be your strength
One thing's for sure, I am your Lord
Yes, I am
I am, I am
Through the chaos, I will be your joy
When you're finished, I have so much more
In the waiting, I'm an open door
Stand still and know, I am your Lord
They'll be times when you're up
And times when you're down
I'm never too far
Just look around and you'll find Me
I'm by your side, arms open wide
I am good, you are loved
Oh, I am good, you are loved
Oh, yes, you are loved, you are loved
What was and is, is covered
By the One who was and is
You're covered by love
What was and is, is covered
By the One who was and is
You're covered by love
I am good, you are loved, oh
Oh, I am good, you are loved
Yes, you are loved
They'll be times when you're up
(Times when you're up)
Times when you're down
(Times when you're down)
I'm never too far
Just look around and you'll find Me
I'm by your side, arms open wide
I am good, you are loved, oh, oh-oh
I am good, you are loved, yeah, yeah
I am good, you are loved
So no matter what comes or goes
One thing that you must know
Is that I am good, you are loved
You are loved, yes, you are
You're still loved by Me
So what was and is, is covered, yeah
By the One who was and is
You're covered by love
What was and is, is covered
By the One who was and is
You're covered by love
You're covered by My love
(Covered by love)
Covered by My love (Oh-oh)
Doesn't matter you've done (No)
Doesn't matter where you've been
Doesn't matter who you were
You're still covered, covered, covered
You're still covered, covered, covered
Oh, if you forget, just lift your head
My banner over you is love
If you forget, just lift your head
My banner over you is love
If you forget, just lift your head
My banner over you is love
If you forget, just lift your head
My banner over you is love
My banner over you is love
What was and is, is covered

Yes, always remember
I am good, you are loved
The proof of my [life] is [love], yeah
The proof of my [life] is [love]
It's time to read it, it's time to believe it
It's love, it's love, it's love, it's love, it's love
It's always been love, love, love, love, love, love, love
We receive Your love now, now, now
Oh, You're not dread of our stories (Yeah)
You turn it all to glory (Ayy)
You're not afraid

We receive, we receive
We receive, we receive
We receive, we receive
We receive it now
There's a cloud over our head
There's a cloud over our head
There's a cloud over our head
Raining love, raining peace
Raining joy, raining life
We receive it now, now
We receive it now, now, now, now, now
Pour it out now
Pour it out now
Pour it out now
Pour it out now
Give us Your love
To the one who wants to come into our side
Receive His love now
To the one who's wrestling with their identity
Receive His love now
To the one who's wrestling with confusion
Receive it, receive it
Receive it, receive it
Receive it, receive it
Receive it, receive it
We've been searching in the wrong places
But we need the love of Abba now
Right now
I am good, you are loved
I am good, you are loved
Don't forget it
I am good, you are loved
Don't forget it
That I am good, you are loved
Oh, I am good
