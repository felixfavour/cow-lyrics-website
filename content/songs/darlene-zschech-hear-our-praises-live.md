"Hear Our Praises"
May our homes be filled with dancing
May our streets be filled with joy
May injustice bow to Jesus
As the people turn to pray
From the mountains to the valleys
Hear our praises rise to You
From the heavens to the nations
Hear our singing fill the air
May Your light shine in the darkness
As we walk before the cross
May Your glory fill the whole earth
As the water o'er seas
From the mountains to the valleys
Hear our praises rise to You
From the heavens to the nations
Hear our singing fill the air
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah...
From the mountains to the valleys
Hear our praises rise to You
From the heavens to the nations
Hear our singing fill the air
