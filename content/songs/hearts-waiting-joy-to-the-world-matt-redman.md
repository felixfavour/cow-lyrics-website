Hearts waiting, waiting on a Saviour
Come, O come, Emmanuel
Hear the prophets, speaking of the promise
Come, O come, Emmanuel
A light of glory filled the sky
And we heard the angel choir
Joy to the world, Joy to the world
The Lord has come, the Lord has come to us
Joy to the world, a Saviour for all
The Lord has come, the Lord has come to us
Messiah, Ruler of the nations
Come, O come, Emmanuel
Our Redeemer
God is with us, God is for us
Come, O come, Emmanuel
The doors of heaven open wide
Can you hear the song inside?
Joy to the world, Joy to the world
The Lord has come, the Lord has come to us
Joy to the world, a Saviour for all
The Lord has come, the Lord has come to us
