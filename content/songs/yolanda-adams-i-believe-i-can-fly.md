0:01]I used to think that I could not go on
[00:07]And life was nothing but an awful song
[00:15]But now I know the meaning of true love
[00:23]I'm leaning on the everlasting armsChorus:
[00:31]If I can see it' then I can do it
[00:39]If I just believe it' there's nothing to it
[00:46]I believe I can fly
[00:50]I believe I can touch the sky
[00:54]I think about it every night and day
[00:58]Spread my wings and fly away
[01:02]I believe I can soar
[01:06]I see me running through that open door
[01:10]I believe I can fly
[01:14]I believe I can fly
[01:18]I believe I can fly
[01:27]See I was on the verge of breaking down
[01:35]Sometimes silence' it can seem so loud
[01:43]There are miracles in life I must achieve
[01:51]But first I know it starts inside of meChorus:
[01:58]If I can see it' then I can be it
[02:07]If I just believe it' there's nothing to it
[02:14]I believe I can fly
[02:18]I believe I can touch the sky
[02:22]I think about it every night and day
[02:26]Spread my wings and fly away
[02:30]I believe I can soar
[02:34]I see me running through that open door
[02:38]I believe I can fly
[02:42]I believe I can fly
[02:46]I believe I can fly
[02:52]Yeah' 'cause I believe in youChorus:
[03:02]If I can see it (wooh)' then I can do it (I can do it)
[03:10]If I just believe it' there's nothing to it
[03:18]I believe I can fly (wooh)
[03:22]I believe I can touch the sky
[03:26]I think about it every night and day
[03:30]Spread my wings and fly away
[03:34]I believe I can soar
[03:38]I see me running through that open door
[03:42]I believe I can fly (I can fly)
[03:46]I believe I can fly (I can fly)
[03:50]I believe I can fly (I can fly)
[03:54]If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
[03:58]I can fly (I can fly)
[04:02]I can fly (I can fly)
[04:06]I can fly (heh! I can fly)
[04:10]If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
[04:14]I can fly (I can fly' I can fly' I can fly' I can fly)
[04:34]Fly' high' high
