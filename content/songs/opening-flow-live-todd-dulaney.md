[Intro]
Come on
Clap your hands
Lion of the tribe of Judah rise up in the room
And the king of Glory shall come in
And the king of glory shall come in
(And the king of glory shall come in)
(And the king of glory shall come in)
(And the king of glory shall come in)
(And the king of glory shall come in)
(And the king of glory shall come in)
(And the king of glory shall come in)
(And the king of glory shall come in)
Three parts
(And the king of glory shall come in)
(And the king of glory shall come in)
(And the king of glory shall come in)
(And the king of glory shall come in)
