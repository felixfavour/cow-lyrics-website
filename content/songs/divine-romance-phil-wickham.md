The fullness of
Your grace is here with me
The richness of
Your beauty's all I see
The brightness of
Your glory has arrived
In Your presence, God
I'm completely satisfied
For You: I sing, I dance
Rejoice in this divine romance
Lift my heart and my hands
To show my love
To show my love
A deep, deep flood
An ocean flows from You
Of deep, deep love
Yeah, it's filling up the room
Your innocent blood
Has washed my guilty life
In Your presence, God
I'm completely satisfied
