Let everything that has breath praise the Lord
(Let everything that has breath praise the Lord)
Sound the alarm to our most high God
(Praise the Lord, oh praise the Lord!)
Praise Him for His excellent greatness
(Praise Him for His excellent greatness)
With the cymbals and stringed instruments
(Praise the Lord, oh praise the Lord!)
Let our praise ring, be glorified, be glorified
Lord, we praise Your name!
Just like David, we'll praise in a-dancing
(Just like David, we'll praise in a dance)
Praise Him with lifting and clapping of hands
(Praise the Lord, oh praise the Lord!)
Bow down before You in majesty
(Bow down before You in majesty)
We declare Your name is holy
(Praise the Lord, oh praise the Lord!)
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord
Praise the Lord!
Sound the alarm to our most high God
Oh, praise the Lord!
Lord, inhabit our praise
Let our praises of Your name
Dwell among us, oh God
And live in our praise
Lord, inhabit our praise
Let our praises of Your name
Dwell among us, oh God
And live in our praise, in our praise
Praise Your name!
Hallelujah, hallelujah...
Hallelujah, hallelujah...
Hallelujah, hallelujah...
Release your praise, all the nations rejoice
(2x)
Hallelujah, hallelujah...
Hallelujah, hallelujah...
Hallelujah, hallelujah...
Release your praise... release your praise...
Release your praise, all the nations rejoice!
