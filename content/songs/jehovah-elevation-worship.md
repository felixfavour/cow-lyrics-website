He shames every idol, He reigns without rival
He goes by the name of Jehovah, Jehovah
He speaks into nothing and darkness goes running
He goes by the name of Jehovah, Jehovah
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Call the name, call the name
Call the name, Jehovah
All our praise, all our praise
All our praise belongs to Him
His foes will be silenced, He's fighting for Zion
There's no other god like Jehovah, Jehovah
His arm never tires, His eyes are like fire
There's no other god like Jehovah, Jehovah
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Call the name, call the name
Call the name, Jehovah
All our praise, all our praise
All our praise belongs to Him
[Bridge: Chris Brown]

Jehovah Nissi, fight your battles
Jehovah Nissi, fight your battles

Jehovah Nissi, fight your battles
Jehovah Jireh, meet your need

Jehovah Shalom, be your peace
Jehovah Nissi, fight your battles
Jehovah Jireh, meet your need
