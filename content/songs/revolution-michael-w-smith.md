You push me and I push back
'Cause it's a MÃ¶bius strip, an endless track
We're going oh, whoa
This carousel keeps on spinning
As the warning bells go on ringing
Singing, oh, whoa
Revolution
Revolution
I build a bridge to the other side
Across the great divide
Do we care and do we hear
All the voices raised and [?] fear
They're singing oh, whoa
All these lights at the raiding
With chores in mind, suffocating
Saying oh, whoa
Revolution
Revolution
I build a bridge to the other side
Across the great divide
Whoa, whoa
