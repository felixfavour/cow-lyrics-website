I feel your love right through my heart
My spirit lifted by yours
You are too great
To great for words
So hear the song of my heart
How I long
Father
How I long for you
Freedom is where you place your feet
Light always shines through the dark
Ever thought of you
For I am yours
Greatest of any rewards
