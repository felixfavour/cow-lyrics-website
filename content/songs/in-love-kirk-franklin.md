Hey hey hey
Thought I had it together now
Hey hey hey
Thought I could handle the weather now
Hey hey hey
Thought Id make it on my own
Hey hey hey
But now I see I was wrong
Hey hey hey
Life ain't the same when you're not with me
Hey hey hey
I feel a change when you're near me
Hey hey hey
I am not afraid to be strong
Hey hey hey
I know I'm never alone, alone
When no ones around and the rains falling down
You cover me
When I can't see a light and my days turn to night
You rescue me
I hope they see
Can't make it without you
Ain't a good day without you
And if they say I'm crazy about you
I just want everybody to see
When they look at me, I hope they can see
I just want the whole world to see
