I bow my knee before Your throne
I know my life is not my own
I offer up this song of praise
To bring You pleasure Lord
I seek the giver not the gift
My heart's desire is to lift Him/You high above all earthly kings
To bring You pleasure Lord
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, Glory to the King
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, Glory to the king
