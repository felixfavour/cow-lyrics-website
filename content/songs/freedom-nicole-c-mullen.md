Ain't got no halo, no wings to fly away
I've got to labor, for many many days
I'm on a journey, I'm looking for a place
To rest by burdens, far from this tyranny
From the shores of Africa
Up to the doors of America
With voices to heaven praying for liberty
We cry freedom (freedom, freedom, freedom)
We marched in 'Bama
We marched in Tennesee
Brown men and white men
Stood for equality
We kept our chin up
We kept our dignity
And our proclamation
Let everbody sing
From the shores of Africa
Up to the doors of America
With voices to heaven praying for liberty
We cry freedom (freedom, freedom, freedom)
