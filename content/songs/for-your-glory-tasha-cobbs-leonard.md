Lord if I
Find favor in your sight
Lord please hear my heart's cry
I'm desperately waiting
To be where you are
I'll cross the hottest desert
I'll travel  near or far
For your glory
I will do anything
Just to see you
To behold you as my king x2
First verse
Chorus x3
I wanna be where you are
Gotta be where you are
I wanna be where you are
Gotta be where you are x8
For your glory
I will do anything
Just to see you
To behold you as my king
