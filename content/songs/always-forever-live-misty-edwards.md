And You are the hand
That catches my fall
You are the friend
That answers my call
You are my day
And You are my night
You are my love
And all of my life
You are the love I need
You are the air I breathe
You are my love, my life
Always forever
And I would lay down my life
Just to be by Your side
You are my love, my life
Always forever
Always forever
You are the grace
That covers my sin
You're everything
Beginning and end
You have my soul
My heart and my mind
You have my love
And all of my life (Life)
