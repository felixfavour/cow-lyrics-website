In my weakest moment I see you
Shaking your head in disgrace
I can read the disappointment
Written all over your face
Here come those whispers in my ear
Saying, "Who do you think you are?"
Looks like you're on your own from here
'Cause grace could never reach that far
But in the shadow of that shame
Beat down by all the blame
I hear you call my name
Saying, "It's not over"
And my heart starts to so beat so loud
Now drowning out the doubt
I'm down but I'm not out
There's a war between guilt and grace
And they're fighting for a sacred space
But I'm living proof
Grace wins every time, yeah
No more lying down in death's defeat
Now I'm rising up in victory
Singing Hallelujah
Grace wins every time
Words can't describe the way it feels
When mercy floods a thirsty soul
A broken side begins to heal
And grace returns what guilt has stole
And in the shadow of that shame
Beat down by all the blame
I hear you call my name
Saying, "It's not over"
And my heart starts to beat so loud
Now drowning out the doubt
I'm down but I'm not out
There's a war between guilt and grace
And they're fighting for a sacred space
But I'm living proof
Grace wins every time, yeah
No more lying down in death's defeat
Now I'm rising up in victory
Singing Hallelujah
Grace wins every time
For the Prodigal Son
Grace wins
For the woman at the well
Grace wins
For the blind men and the beggar
Grace wins
For always and forever
Grace wins
For the lost out on the street
Grace wins
For the worst part of you and me
Grace wins
For the thief on the cross
Grace wins
For a world that is lost
There's a war between guilt and grace
And they're fighting for a sacred space
But I'm living proof
Grace wins every time, yeah
No more lying down in death's defeat
Now I'm rising up in victory
Singing Hallelujah
Grace wins every time
Every time
