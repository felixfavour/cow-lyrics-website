I've come too far to look back again
There is nothing behind me
All the treasures I used to love
Have all faded from view
There's a new day ahead for me
All my heartache is over
For I left it at calvary
Where my new life began

I've come too far to look back
My feet have walked thru the valley
I've climbed mountains, crossed rivers
Desert places I've known
But I'm nеaring the home shore
Thе redeemed are rejoicing
Heaven's angels are singing
I've come too far to look back

Look around, there's no happiness
There's no reason for living
Life will give you a broken dream
Full of sorrow and fear
Turn around, don't look back again
Face the new day before you
Place your heartache in Jesus' hand
He can mend broken dreams

I've come too far to look back
My feet have walked thru the valley
I've climbed mountains, crossed rivers
Desert places I've known
But I'm nearing the home shore
The redeemed are rejoicing
Heaven's angels are singing
I've come too far to look back

But I'm nearing the home shore
The redeemed are rejoicing
Heaven's angels are singing
I've come too far to look back
Too far to look back
