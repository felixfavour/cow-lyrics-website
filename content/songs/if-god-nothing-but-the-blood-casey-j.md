What shall
We say to these things?
There's still cancer
And so much disease

What shall
We say to these things?
So much hurting
And broken esteem
So many questions
But still one answer

If God be for me, who can be against me?
If God is with me, whom shall I fear?
If no one knows me, still His heart adores me
I am safe, I am loved, I am healed

What shall
We say to these things?
So much violence
It's getting hard to believe
And what shall
We say to these things?

So many people hurting
With broken esteem
So many questions
But still one answer

If God be for me, who can be against me?
If God is with me, whom shall I fear?
If no one knows me, still His heart adores me
I am safe, I am loved, I am healed

If God be for me, who can be against me?
If God is with me, whom shall I fear?
If no one knows me, still His heart adores me
I am safe, I am loved, I am healed

Now what can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
And what can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
It was no other fount I know
It was nothing but the blood of Jesus

That I could do, no worse
That I could say, no price
That I could pay
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh, precious is the flow 
That makes me white as snow
It was no other fount I know
It was nothing but the blood of Jesus

That we could do, no worse
That we could say, no price
That we could pay
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

It was
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
It was
Nothing but Your blood, my Jesus
It was
Nothing but Your blood, my Jesus

If You are for me, who can be against me?
If You are with me, whom shall I fear?
If no one knows me, still His heart adores me
I am safe, I am loved, I am healed
I am safe, I am loved, I am healed
I am safe, I am loved, I am healed
I am safe, I am loved, I am healed
