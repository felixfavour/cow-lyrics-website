Track "Chris Tomlin"
     "His Name Is Wonderful"
Come see the baby, crib for a bed
His mother Mary lay down His sweet head
The starlight was shining, the wisemen were led
Come see the baby and worship Him
chorus:
His name is Wonderful Counselor
Mighty God, Prince of Peace
Everlasting Father, Emmanuel
Holy One, Son of God
Savior of the world
Come and adore Him on bended knee
He came to ransom someone like me
What could I offer, what could I bring
Come and adore Him, King of Kings
chorus:
His name is Wonderful Counselor
Mighty God, Prince of Peace
Everlasting Father, Emmanuel
Holy One, Son of God
Savior of the world
And the greatness of His reign will never end
Let there be peace on earth and all goodwill to men
Come let us worship Him
Wonderful Counselor
Mighty God, Prince of Peace
Everlasting Father, Emmanuel
Holy One, Son of God
Savior of the world
His name is Wonderful Counselor
Mighty God, Prince of Peace
Everlasting Father, Emmanuel
Holy One, Son of God
Savior of the world
