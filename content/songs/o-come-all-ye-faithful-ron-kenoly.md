O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Yea Lord we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus to Thee be all glory given
Word of the Father now in flesh appearing
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God
Glory in the highest
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
