There is a day coming when the old will pass away
Every wrong will be made right, no darkness, no night, the Son will light the way
Can you imagine? Can you imagine?
There is a king coming, the one who conquered death and grave
No more pain and no more sorrow, this hope for tomorrow is our hope for this day
This day in this place
[Pre-Chorus]
He who was, He who is
He who was, He who is
He who is to come, Christ the Son of man
Riding on the clouds with a crown upon His head
Oh, every eye will see Him with the nail scars in His hands
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Only one, only one
There's only One worthy of all glory and all praise
All wealth and all honor, speak wisdom and power to the Lamb that was slain
Oh
