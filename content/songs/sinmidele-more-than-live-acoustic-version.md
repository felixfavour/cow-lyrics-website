re than silver
More than gold
You're the treasure I behold
More than the beauty of this world
I love You Lord
More than the pleasures of this life
More than the accolades that feed my pride
I love You Jesus
I love You Jesus
It's why I live
And what I breathe for
To love you Jesus
To love you Jesus
Is why I live
And what I breathe for
To love you Jesus
To love you Jesus
Is why I live
And what I breathe for
More than silver
More than gold
You're the treasure I behold
More than the beauty of this world
I love You Lord
Oh the comfort of this life
Means nothing to being by Your side
I love you Jesus
I love you Jesus
It's why I live
And what I breathe for
Oh the pleasures of this life
Means nothing to being by Your side
I love You Jesus
I love You Jesus
You're why I breathe
And what I live for
May this love keep on burning
May my heart keep on yearning
To love you Jesus
To love you Jesus
Is why I live
And what I breathe for
I love you Jesus
Above my flesh
I love you Jesus
You have my yes

Above my flesh
I love you Jesus
You have my yes
Oh the pleasures of this life
Is nothing to being by Your side
