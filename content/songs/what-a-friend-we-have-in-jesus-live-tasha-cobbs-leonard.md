What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry
We bring everything to my God in prayer
Oh, what peace we often forfeit
And, oh, what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer
Carry everything to God in prayer, ooh, mm
We bring everything, yeah
Everything to God in prayer
[Outro]
He is my friend
You oughta take a personal moment right here
And love Him back, love Him
