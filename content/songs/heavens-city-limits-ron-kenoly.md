As we walk along life's highway there are signs along the way
Some signs are there to guide us and others cause us to stray
But the sign we've all been looking for will melt our fears away
Cause when we read that sign this is what that sign will say
Heaven City Limits, we're almost home now
Work you've done for Jesus is worth your time
No more tears, no more sorrow, no more trouble on your mind
Soon as we reach that city limit line
My friend, if your not happy traveling down the road you're on
Won't you take a walk on my road? My road leads straight to home
It may be tomorrow, or around the next bend
Traveling days are over, we have reached the end
Heaven City Limits, we're almost home now
Work you've done for Jesus is worth your time
No more tears, no more sorrow, no more trouble on your mind
Soon as we cross that city limit line
No more tears, no more sorrow, no more trouble on your mind
Soon as we cross that city limit line
