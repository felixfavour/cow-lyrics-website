Before I knew my name, before I drew a breath
He was making ways for me
Now and every day, in each and every step
He is making ways for me
[Pre-Chorus: Naomi Raine]
When my heart is full of doubt
Feels like faith is running out
I've come too far to turn around
I know
[Chorus: Naomi Raine]
God will work it out
God will work it out
One thing I know
One thing Iâ€™ve found
God will work it out, woah
Oh, yes, He will
Oh, things are coming together
Pushing past the fear, fighting to believe
He is making ways for me
And He won't let me down, never ever leave
He's still making ways for me
