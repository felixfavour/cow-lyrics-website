How can say thanks for the things
You have done for me
Things so undeserved yet you gave
To prove your love for me
The voices of a million angels
Could not express my gratitude
All that am and ever hope to be
I owe it all to thee
To God be the glory, to God be the glory
To God be the glory for the things he has done
He has done
With his blood he has saved me
With his power he has raised me
To God be the glory for the things he has done
Just let me live my life and
Let it be pleasing LORD to thee
Should I get any praise let it go to Calvary
To God be the glory
To God be the glory for the things he has done
With His blood he has saved me
With His power he has raised me
To God be the glory for the things he has done
He has done
He has done great things
He has done great things
How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see
How great is our God
Oh oh oh
How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see
How great is our God
Our God
How great
How great
Is our God
How can I say thanks for the things you have done for me?
