This is my prayer that you would bless me
This is my prayer that your hand be with me
This is my prayer from evil you'd keep me Lord (oh yeah)
This is my prayer that it would not grieve me
Enlarge my territory

I see increase all around me
Stretch forth, break forth
Release me, enlarge my territory
No limits

Can you see it
No limits
Can you feel it
No Limits

Can you see it
No Limits
Go and Get it
Can you see it, No limits
