A long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible says
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ
Was born on Chris-ta-mas-day

Listen, hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Chris-ta-mas-day

While shepherds watched their flocks by night
Them see a new brighting star
And then them hear a choir sing
It seemed to come from afar

Listen, hear the angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Chris-ta-mas-day
