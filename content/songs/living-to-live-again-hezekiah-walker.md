I'm living to live again
I'm living to live again
When he [?] mountain
This whole world goodbye
When he [?] mountain
This whole world goodbye
They'll be no more crying
They'll be no more dying
They'll be no more sorrow
No more sad tomorrow
I'm living to live again
I'm living to live again
When he [?] mountain
This whole world goodbye
When he [?] mountain
This whole world goodbye
When he [?] mountain
This whole world goodbye
When he [?] mountain
This whole world goodbye
They'll be no more crying
They'll be no more dying
They'll be no more sorrow
No more sad tomorrow
They'll be no more crying
They'll be no more dying
They'll be no more sorrow
No more sad tomorrow
I'm living to live again
