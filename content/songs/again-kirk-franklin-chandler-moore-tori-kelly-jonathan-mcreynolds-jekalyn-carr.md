[Chorus]
See I don't know how
And I can't tell you when
When our fears will all fade
And a new season begins
But I know somehow
How the story will end
See I believe God for more
And if He did it before
He will do it again, again, again, again and again
God will do it again, again, again, again and again
L've been down before
I was born at the end
Never learned how to fly
Loneliness was my friend
So when the storm came
I looked deep in my soul
When the planet got loud
I knew just where to go, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
There's a secret place far above all the things I see, mmm
Where peace like a river flows to encourage me
