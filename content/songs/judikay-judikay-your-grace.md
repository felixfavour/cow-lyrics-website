Your mercies endures forever
Your mercies are new every morning
You're so gracious, so kind
So full of love
Your tender mercies are rich towards me
Your mercies endures forever
Your mercies are new every morning
You're so gracious, so kind
So full of love
Your tender mercies are rich towards me
Your grace overwhelms me
Your love overwhelms me
Who am I without Your grace?
Your grace overwhelms me
Your love overwhelms me
Who am I without Your grace?
Your grace, Your grace, Your grace
Your grace overwhelms me
Your love overwhelms me
I am nothing- (who am I without Your grace?)
Darling Jesus, Your grace overwhelms me
Your grace overwhelms me
Your love overwhelms me
Who am I without Your grace?
Thank You for Your grace
Thank You for Your grace
Thank You for Your grace
What greater love than this
That a man should lay down His life for me
For a debt He did not owe (eh yah, ah)
Look what Your blood has done
I am no longer the same
Now I stand boldly, righteous
Completely forgiven
Darling, darling Jesus
I am nothing without Your grace
Nothing without Your grace
You're so gracious, so kind
So full of love
Your tender mercies are rich towards me
Your grace overwhelms me
Your love overwhelms me
Who am I without Your grace?
Your grace, Your grace, Your love
(Your grace overwhelms me) Your mercy, Your goodness
(Your love overwhelms me) I'm nothing without Your grace
Who am I without Your grace?
Your grace overwhelms me
Your grace overwhelms me
Your love overwhelms me
Who am I without Your grace?
Darling Jesus, Your grace overwhelms me
Your grace overwhelms me
(Your love overwhelms me) I am nothing without
Who am I without Your grace?
I'm nothing without Your grace
I'm nothing without Your grace
I'm nothing without Your grace
I'm nothing without Your grace, you say
I'm nothing without Your grace
I'm nothing without Your grace
I'm nothing without Your grace
I'm nothing without Your grace
Completely nothing (I'm nothing without Your grace)
Completely nothing (I'm nothing without Your grace)
Completely nothing (I'm nothing without Your grace)
Completely nothing (I'm nothing without Your grace)
Nothing without Your grace (I'm nothing without Your grace)
Nothing without Your grace (I'm nothing without Your grace)
