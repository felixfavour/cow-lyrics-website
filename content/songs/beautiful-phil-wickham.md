I see Your face in every sunrise
The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes
The world awakens in the light of the day
I look up to the sky and say
You're beautiful
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)
I see Your power in the moonlit night
Where planets are in motion and galaxies are bright
We are amazed in the light of the stars
It's all proclaiming who You are
You're beautiful
(Oh, Oh, You're beautiful, Oh, Oh)
I see You there hanging on a tree
You bled and then You died and then You rose again for mе
Now You are sitting on Your heavenly thronе
Soon we will be coming home
You're beautiful
(Oh, Oh, You're beautiful, Oh, Oh)
Let's sing it out
When we arrive at eternity's shore
Where death is just a memory and tears are no more
We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring
Your bride will come together and we'll sing
You're beautiful
Oh, You're beautiful
