It breaks your heart
When you see me dancing with the enemy (wow, wow)
Yes, it breaks your heart
When You see your bride in adultery
You were meant to be my only one
[Chorus: Chandler Moore & 
Maverick City Choir
]
You are a jealous God
You are jealous for me
You are a jealous God
You are jealous for me
You know my heart
How easily it wanders when I look away
But You have my heart
And there's no competition when it comes to you
You were meant to be my only one
[Chorus: Lizzie Morgan, 
Chandler Moore
 & 
Maverick City Choir
]
You are a jealous God (yes You're)
You are jealous for me (oh oh)
You are a jealous God
You are jealous for me (I know it, I know that)
You are a jealous God (this is the way You love it)
You are jealous for me (oh oh oh)
You are a jealous God
You are jealous for me
