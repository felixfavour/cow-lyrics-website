Have you ever seen the wonder
In the glimmer of first sight
As the eyes begin to open
And the blindness meets the light
If you have so say
[Chorus:]
I see the world in light
I see the world in wonder
I see the world in life
Bursting in living colour
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light
Have you ever seen the wonder
In the air of second life
Having come out of the waters
With the old one left behind
If you have so say
[Chorus:]
I see the world in light
I see the world in wonder
I see the world in life
Bursting in living colour
I see the world Your way
And I'm walking in the light
