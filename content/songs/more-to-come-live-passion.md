You're the God who makes the giants fall
You bring down the walls of Jericho
You’re the God who gives the miracle
We believe
You're the God who parts the ocean wide
Just to bring us closer to Your side
You're the God who brings the dead to life
We believe
Oh, we believe
God, how great You are
And great things You have done
For everything we’ve seen
There is more to come
Every victory
Every battle won
For everything we've seen
There is more to come, hey
We are confident in all Your ways
'Cause we know You never make mistakes
God, You fill us with a greater faith
We believe (Do you believe? Do you believe? Oh, God)
