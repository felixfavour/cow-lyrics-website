There is a sound I love to hear
It's the sound of the Saviour's robe
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear praises, He hears faith
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
Oh, awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud (Oh)
(Hallelujah)
(His praise, yeah)
There is a sound that changes things
The sound of His people on their knees
Oh, wake up, you slumbering
It's time to worship Him
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
Oh, awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
And when He moves
And when we pray
Where stood a wall now stands a way
Where every promise is amen
And when He moves
Make no mistake
The bowels of hell begin to shake
All hail the Lord, all hail the King
Hey, oh
Oh let the king of glory enter in
Hey, oh
(Fall down on your knees and worship Him)
Fall down on your knees and worship Him
Hey, oh
(Let His praise rise up, don't hold it in)
Don't hold it in, oh
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
Oh, awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
