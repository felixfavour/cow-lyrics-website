[Intro: Phil Wickham]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Joy to the world!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Joy to the world! The Lord is come!
Let earth receive Her King
Let ev'ry heart prepare Him room
[Pre-Chorus: Phil Wickham]
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heav'n, and Heav'n, and nature sing

Joy to the world! (

We will sing, sing, sing (
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Joy to the world! The Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ! (
Their songs employ!

While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains
