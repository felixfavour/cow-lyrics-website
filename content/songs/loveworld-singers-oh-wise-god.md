Hallelujah
Just lift your hands and glorify God
He's the wisest of all
He's the greatest of all
His wisdom I personified and out
We worship you forever O God

Unfailing God, I worship you today

Unfailing God, I worship you today
For you are holy, You are holy, Jesus
You are holy and you are beautiful, Jesus

From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same
Your name be praised
Lift your hands and glorify him

And the earth is His footstool
