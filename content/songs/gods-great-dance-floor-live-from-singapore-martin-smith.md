I’m coming back to the start
Where You found me
I’m coming back to Your heart
Now I surrender
[Pre-Chorus]
Take me
This is all I can bring
You’ll never stop loving us
No matter how far we run
You’ll never give up on us
All of heaven shouts: let the future begin
So where the chains fall of
God is freedom
And here we feel Your heart
Your heart before us
[Pre-Chorus]
Take me
This is all I can bring
