I'm coming apart at the seams and everyone's pulling at me
And I am unraveling
The smile isn't quite what it seems
But it does well to hide what's beneath
Where the pressure is staggering
And in the unraveling, Father unravel me
And when I can't feel a thing
Have mercy and let me bleed
I know it's dumb, yeah
But I have been numb, for way too long
Oh, oh, oh
And oh, oh, oh, oh
So goodbye now, yellow brick road
Thanks a lot what I need is back home
So homeward I'm traveling
In the unraveling, Father unravel mе
When I can't feel a thing
Have mercy and lеt me bleed
I know it's dumb
But I have been numb, for way too long
And oh, oh, oh
And oh, oh, oh, oh
