It's over now
It's over now
I feel like I can make it
The storm is over now
It's over now
It's over now
I feel like I can make it
The storm is over now
It's over now
It's over now
I feel like I can make it
The storm is over now
No more cloudy days
They're all gone... gone away
I feel like I can make it
No more cloudy days
They're all gone away
I feel like I can make it
The storm is over now
If I walk alone
I'm not on my own
I feel like I can make it
 the storm is over now
If I walk alone
I'm not on my own
I feel like I can make it
 the storm is over now
It's over now
It's over now
I feel like I can make it
The storm is over now
No more no more
Cloudy days cloudy days
The storm  is the storm is
Over now over now
No more no more
Cloudy days cloudy days
The storm is the storm is
Over now over now
No more no more
Crying at night crying at night
The storm is the storm is
Over now
No more no more
Sickness in my body sickness in my body
The storm  is the storm is
Over now
No more no more
Crying at night crying at night
The storm  is the storm is
Over now,,,over now
No more no more
Crying at night crying at night
The storm is,,,the storm is
Over now,,over now
No more no more
Crying at night crying at night
The storm  is the storm is
Over now over now
No more tears and sorrow
No more no more no more
Heartache and pain
Over now
No more no more
Suffering no more
No more no more
It's over now over now
