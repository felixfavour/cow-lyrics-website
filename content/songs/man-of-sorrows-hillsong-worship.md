Man of Sorrows, Lamb of God
By His own betrayed
The sin of men and wrath of God
Has been on Jesus laid
Silent as He stood accused
Beaten, mocked, and scorned
Bowing to the Father's will
He took a crown of thorns
And oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"Praise and honour unto Thee
Sent of heaven, God's own Son
To purchase and redeem
And reconcile the very ones
Who nailed Him to that tree
Oh that rugged cross, my salvation
Where Your love poured out over me
Now my soul cries out "Hallelujah!"Praise and honour unto Thee
