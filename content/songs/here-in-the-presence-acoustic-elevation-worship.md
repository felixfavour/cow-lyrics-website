Here I lay my burdens down
Lose my worries in Your love
Casting every care on You
I have carried them enough
We're not alone
Here within His love
Emmanuel
He is still with us
When the world becomes too much
Near the cross, I will remain
Until every fear is stilled
At the mention of Your name
We're not alone
Here within His love
Emmanuel
He is still with us
He is with us now
[Interlude]
