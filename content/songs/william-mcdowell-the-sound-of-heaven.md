There is a sound
Sound of hope
Sound of love
Drawing all to come
There is a sound
Sound of joy
Sound of peace
Flowing out of me
Sound to heal the broken heart
Comfort for the least of these
Justice for the lawless
Righteousness and ever flowing stream
For the fatherless, the widows and the orphans
To hear the sound
We will release the sound of heaven

There is a sound
Sound of hope
Sound of love
Drawing all to come
There is a sound
Sound of joy
Sound of peace
Flowing out of me
Sound to heal the broken heart
Comfort for the least of these
Justice for the lawless
Righteousness and ever flowing stream
For the fatherless, the widows and the orphans
To hear the sound
We will release the sound of heaven
They're crying
They're seeking
The world is searching
They're searching
For the sound of heaven
They're calling
They're watching
Watching and waiting for you..
They're waiting
For the sound of heaven
They're hungry
They're thirsty
They're desperate
For the sound of heaven
We will release the sound
We will release the sound
We will release the sound of heaven
We will release the sound
We will release the sound
We will release the sound of heaven
The world is waiting for you and me
We will release the sound
We will release the sound
We will release the sound of heaven
We will release the sound
We will release the sound
We will release the sound of heaven
