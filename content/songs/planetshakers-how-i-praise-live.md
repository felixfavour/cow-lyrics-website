To You my Saviour
I'm gonna stand up
And give You everything, everything
Everything, all that I am
This is how I praise You

Yeah I'm on fire
I'm gonna dive in
And give You everything, everything
Everything, all that I am
cos I'm In love with You
I'm in love with You
For all You've brought me through
My praise belongs to You

This is how I praise You
This is how I praise You
This is why I praise You
'Cause You're amazing
And You are greater
You're everlasting
And You are everything, everything
Everything, Jesus you are
cos I'm In love with You
I'm in love with You
For all You've brought me through
My praise belongs to You
This is how I praise You
This is how I praise You
