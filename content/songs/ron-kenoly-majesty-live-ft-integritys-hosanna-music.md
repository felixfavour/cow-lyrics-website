Majesty
Worship His majesty
Unto Jesus
Be all glory power and praise
Majesty
Kingdom authority
Flows from His throne
Unto His own
His anthem raise
tonight lord Jesus we set aside the balance of this evening to focus upon your kingship and your lordship, yes lord we acknowledge you as the sacrifice, great sacrificial lamb, we thank you lord God for the blood you shed for us,  we thank you oh lord God for the great mercies and blessings that you shower upon our lives.  but tonight lord, we want to see you not as the lamb but we want to worship you as  that lion of Judah the king above all kings,  thank you, thank you for your presence, we bow before you, we acknowledge you,  we honor you as king of kings and lord of lords.
So exalt
Lift up on high
The name of Jesus
Magnify
Come glorify
Christ Jesus the King
Majesty
Worship His majesty
Jesus who died
Is now glorified
King of all kings
Jesus who died
Is now glorified
Jesus who died
Is now glorified
Jesus who died
Is now glorified
King of all kings
Amen
