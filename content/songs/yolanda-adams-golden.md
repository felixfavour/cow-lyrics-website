Yeah, Everything we touch turns Golden
Yeah, Everything we touch turns Golden
Yeah, Everything we touch turns Golden
Everything we touch turns Golden
He told me that I was the apple of His eye
Then He told me there were big things I could define
Then He gave me all the power that was in his hands
Reassuring there were things that I could command
If that's what you want
The ability, the authority
If that's what you need
The power and the victory
He's got what you want
The power to rule and the power to reign
Come get what you need
'Cause it's all in His name, and everything we touch turns Golden
Everything we touch turns Golden (Oh yeah)
Everything we touch turns Golden (Yeah yeah yeah)
Everything we touch turns Golden
Everything we touch turns Golden (Everything)
Everything we touch turns Golden (We touch)
Everything we touch turns Golden (Turns Golden)
Everything we touch turns Golden
Everything we touch turns Golden
Yes I believe and I receive every Word He said
From the impossible to the possible destinies ahead
So if you're ready to live this life just like we do
No more stress and no regretting, it's all up to you
If that's what you want
The ability, the authority
If that's what you need
The power and the victory
He's got what you want
Power to rule and the power to reign
Come get what you need
'Cause it's all in His name, and everything
Everything we touch turns Golden (Turns Golden)
Everything we touch turns Golden (Everything)
Everything we touch turns Golden (Turns Golden)
Everything we touch turns Golden (My life)
Everything we touch turns Golden (Is Golden)
Everything we touch turns Golden (My child)
Everything we touch turns Golden (Is Golden)
Everything we touch turns Golden
You don't have to live
In defeat worrying about how it's gonna be, no
'Cause if you only knew, what's inside of you
You'll stand bold 'cause you know
That you hold the power that makes you Golden
Everything we touch turns Golden
It makes you Golden (Everything we touch turns Golden)
Yeah yeah yeah (Everything we touch turns Golden)
It's in His blood (Everything we touch turns Golden)
That makes you Golden (Everything we touch turns Golden)
Yes It's in the blood (Everything we touch turns Golden)
That make you Golden (Everything we touch turns Golden)
And His Word (Everything we touch turns Golden)
Makes your Golden (Everything we touch turns Golden)
Yes his Word (Everything we touch turns Golden)
Makes you Golden (Everything we touch turns Golden)
You keep on saying (Everything we touch turns Golden)
You keep on living (Everything we touch turns Golden)
You keep on breathing (Everything we touch turns Golden)
Because you're golden (Everything we touch turns Golden)
If that's what you want
The ability, the authority
If that's what you need
The power and the victory
He's got what you want
The power to rule and the power to reign
Come get what you need
'Cause it's all in His name (Yeah yeah yeah)
You're Golden
Don't let no body tell ya, you ain't Golden
It's in His blood, that's why you're Golden
It's in His word, that's why you're Golden
You are Golden
