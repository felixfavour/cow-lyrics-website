[Intro]
There is God, He is alive and well
And He reign supreme over everything
He is the God of all flesh
He is the God that's created everything by the word of His power
And so we give God praise, and we give God honor, and we give God glory
Somebody rise up and praise Him, shake this place real quick
Yeah, yes, hallelujah
The song says:
There is love that is like no other
There is strength that will pull you through
There is God standing in your corner
There is nothing, nothing He cannot do
There is grace that has no measure
There is mercy that has no end
There is a life for you, there is joy and pleasure
There is God, He's your closest friend
There is, there is
There is, there is
There is, there is
There is, there is God
There is, there is
There is, there is
There is, there is
There is, there is God
