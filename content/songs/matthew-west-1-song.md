ohhh yayayayax2
love written in a bunch of these
words cause melodies
i picked up my first guitar and never looked back.
still in search for a perfect verse
same to same the same at first
but just in case it's my last
i want you to know this is how it would go.
CHORUS
if i only had one song
i will sing it for you
one last chance and let my words ring too it would be a hallelujah be thankin Lord be an Amen and all made new.
one song
i will sing it for you
ohhh yayayaya
you
ohhh yayayaya
i can use some Cain chains worth the kind you only hear in church make you really sound good all good impress a lot of people but if i was down to my last breath if i had one heart beat left
i keep sure and simple
CHORUS
If i had one song
i would sing it for you
one last chance and let my words ring too it would be a hallelujah be thankin  Lord be an Amen and all made new.
one song
i would sing it for you
ohhh yayayaya
you
ohhh yayayaya
instrumental
i want you to know this is how it would go
i just tell you i love you
if i only had one song
i would sing it for you one last chance
and let my words ring to you it will be a hallelujah be thankin Lord be an Amen and all made new one song
if only had one song i would sing it for you one last chance and want the last thing I do be hallelujah be thankin Lord be an Amen and all made new one song
i will sing it for you
every storm every night every word every time
i will sing it for you X2
every storm every night every word every time
i will sing it for you
ohhh yayayaya
