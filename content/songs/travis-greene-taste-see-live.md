Searching far and wide for anything to fill your heart
Love that was inside is far away when the pain starts
And the day has become dark
Everything's falling apart now
God is good
So taste and see that the Lord is good
Taste and see that the Lord is good
Try him now, one thing's for sure
He will never forsake you
Peace is hard
Peace is hard to find
When the storm
When the storm crashes on you
Stand the
Test of time
What you've tried
Is what you've tried your best to do
And loneliness stays close to
Loneliness stays close to you
Those you love somehow
Those you love somehow you lose
Now
Now
But God is
But God is good
So taste and
Taste and see that the Lord is good
Tast and
Taste and see that the Lord is good
Try him now
Try him now, one thing's for sure
Yes, he will never forsake you
Taste and see
Taste and see that the Lord is good
Taste and see
Taste and see that the Lord is good
Try him now
Try him now, one thing's for sure
He will never forsake you
Come on now, you got it
Taste and see
Taste and see that the Lord is good
Taste and see
Taste and see that the Lord is good
Try him
Try him now, one thing's for sure
He will
He will never forsake you
Taste and
Taste and see that the Lord is good
Taste and
Taste and see that the Lord is good
Try him now, one thing's for sure
He will never forsake you
Hey
Hands up
Never forsake you
Oh oh oh, the Lord is good
