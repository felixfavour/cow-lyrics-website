I remember what You did for me
I remember how You bled for me
It was the greatest sacrifice
That You gave up Your life
I remember what You did for me
All the pain You had to bear for me
How You took the greatest fall for me
All my sin and all my shame
It took You to the grave
I remember how You died for me
But it wasn't over
For You are greater
And Your love is stronger
You're alive
You rose up from the grave
You're alive
Forever You will reign
Jesus You are greater
You are Christ, our Saviour
You're alive
I remember when I was alone
I remember how Your mercy flowed
and You wiped away my tears
You took away my fears
I remember how You brought me home
But it wasn't over
For You are greater
And Your love is stronger
For You have the victory
Over the enemy
Jesus You're mighty
You're alive
You rose up from the grave
You're alive
Forever You will reign
