Eyes haven't seen
And ears haven't heard

Keep defeat out the door

Get ready for overflow
'Cause I'm getting ready

(I'm getting ready to see)
Oh, something I've never seen
(Something I've never seen)
Yo, aye yo, beach house vibes, maneuver the jetski
'Cause-'cause I serve the God that parted the Red Sea
Multi-million dollars commercials for Pepsi
From food-stamps to more ice than Gretzky
I don't gotta talk, the Lord defends me
I watch them all fall for going against me
'Cause me and all my angels shot the devil up
While you was trying to pull me down, I levelled up
I levelled up twice, I levelled up three times
He tapped 'em and told 'em "she's mine"
So even when I cried I knew I'd be fine
Prepare for a miracle blessing in these times
Now praise Him, raise Him, name it, claim it
Every tongue that rises up against me, shame it
I breathe success in and out my lungs
I got the power of life and death coming out of my tongue
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh
You gotta move a little bit with that
Say oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh
Said again, say I'm
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh
It's about to be real big, say oh
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oh, ooh-ooooh
Now somebody raise it
Say I'm getting ready (I'm getting ready)
Ready for overflow (ready for overflow)
It's real easy, somebody declare it
Say I'm getting ready (I'm getting ready)
What are you ready for? (ready for overflow)
Say it again, say I'm getting ready (I'm getting ready)
Ready for overflow (ready for overflow)
It's about to be running over in my lfe, yeah (I'm getting ready)
Ready for overflow (ready for overflow)
