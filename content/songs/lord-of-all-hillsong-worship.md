Lord, I long to see You glorified
In everything I do
All my heartfelt dreams, I put aside
To see Your spirit move with power in my life
Jesus Lord of all eternity
Your children rise in faith
All the earth displays Your glory
And each word You speak brings life to all who hears
Lord of all
All of creations
Sings Your praise
In Heaven and earth
Lord we stand
Hearts open wide
Be exalted
Lord of all
All of creations
Sings Your praise
In Heaven and earth
Lord we stand
Hearts open wide
Be exalted
