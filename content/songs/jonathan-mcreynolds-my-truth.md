"My Truth"
Everyone has a God
Whether they notice it or not
Something to glue their beliefs to
As for me, that's something's You
For better or for worse
We all have a life we must preserve
And everyone is on key to their own melody
I just feel Your song was made for me
And everybody has their point of view
And everyone lives like life taught them to
But I'm just gonna keep my eyes stayed on You 'cause
You are my truth
Everyone won't agree
And I don't always live You perfectly
But that doesn't change the strength of Your name
We've got history that can't be erased
Just 'cause everybody has their point of view
And everybody lives like life taught them to
I'm just gonna keep my eyes stayed on You 'cause
You are my truth
Oh, You are my truth
We were helpless when You arrived
And You flipped the game on its side
Then You took the blame and You died
Just so I can have life everlasting
Everybody has their point of view
And everybody lives like life taught them to
But I'm just gonna keep my eyes stayed on You 'cause
You are my truth
Whoa, this world will prepare
A pulpit for theirs
But You
You are my truth
