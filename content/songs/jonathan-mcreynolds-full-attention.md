Hey, no, no
I don't need another tragedy (No)
Just to realize how much I need (Hey)
See I don't need a girl to break my heart (No)
Just to realize where true love starts (Yea)
I've been so convinced lately
You're the only thing I see (Oh)
You've got my full attention
You've got my full attention
Seek You first, then I'll find, everything I've wanted
You've got my full attention (Hey)
If I am Yours and You are mine (Oh)
Why do I give everybody else my time (Mmm)
See I don't wanna have so much to do (No)
I become the child you never knew, never knew
I am so convinced lately
You're the only thing I see
You've, got my, full attention
You've, got my, full attention
Seek You first, then I'll find, everything I've wanted
You've, got my, full attention
So even if I lose control
And my strength is running low
There's only one thing that I know for sure, My
Focus will remain on You
You've got my full attention
You've got my full attention
Seek You first, then I'll find, everything I've wanted
You've got my full attention
Yeah Yea
You've got it, you've got it (Hey)
You've got it, you've got it, you
Yea, one time, one time
