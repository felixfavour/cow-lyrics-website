Like a soldier with no armor
In the middle of the battle I was broken
I was broken
It was only getting darker
In the valley of the shadow, I was hopeless
I was hopeless
[Pre-Chorus: Bart Millard]
I never thought that I would ever see the day
When every single chain would break
Or hear the voice of Heaven call my name
[Chorus: Bart Millard]
Then Christ came
Changing everything, He took my sin and shame away
Now every song
I sing will be for Him, ever since the moment He walked in
Then Christ came
I was searching for a reason
To believe that I could ever really matter
Ever matter
And I was hoping, I was reaching
So desperate for my soul to find its Savior
Oh, I need a Savior
