You came down
From Heaven's throne
This earth You formed
Was not Your home
A love like this
The world had never known
: Chris Tomlin
A crown of thorns
To mock Your name
Forgiveness fell
Upon Your face
A love like this
The world had never known
[Chorus]: Chris Tomlin
On the altar of our praise
Let there be no higher name
Jesus, Son of God!
You laid down Your perfect life
You are the sacrifice
Jesus, Son of God!
You are Jesus, Son of God!
: 
Christy Nockels
You took our sin
You bore our shame
You rose to life
You defeated the grave
A love like this, the world has never known (oh)
