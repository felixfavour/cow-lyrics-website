I know he rescued my soul
His blood has covered my sin
I believe, I believe
My shame, He's taken away
My pain is healed in his name
I believe, I believe
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll raise a banner (Oh-oh-oh)
'Cause my Lord has conquered the grave
My Redeemer Lives
My Redeemer Lives
My Redeemer Lives
My Redeemer Lives
[Bridge]
You Lift my burdens
I'll rise with You
I'm dancing on this mountain top
To see your kingdom come
