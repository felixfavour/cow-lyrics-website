think about life
think about us
and all the crazy things we see
they're vanity
they fade away like the grass in the open field.
trapped in time what would you do
would you rather let your life pass you by
say yes to the master don't let him live
it's your day don't let it slip away.
you never say.
ah another day
another day
ah another day
another day /2
you give so many reasons yet none is so appeasing.
do you know it is appointed for man once to die.
after that judgement where would you be then.
have you ever wondered oh oh oh
you see the Pharisees and the saducees
where so amazed at the miracles that Jesus did.
even Nicodemus believed in this God.
now I say to you stop asking for.
ah another day
another day.
ah another day
another day /2
you've come this far to loose everything yeah yeah yeah yeah
build up the trashes were most cannot enter eh mm.
there is a place prepared for you that's your inheritance.
so make up your mind and give in today.
stop asking for(ah another day, another day)
stop asking for (ah another day, another day /2)
I need you today /3
not another day
stop procastinating yeah
not tomorrow ooo
I need you today /4
he wants you
he needs your heart
Jesus is calling
I need you today/3
not tomorrow
not another day eh yeaahh oooohhh ohhh
