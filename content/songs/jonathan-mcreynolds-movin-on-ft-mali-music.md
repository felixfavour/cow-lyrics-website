Movin' On"
I'm closing chapters
I'm turning pages
Glory to glory
From faith to faith
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
I'm getting older
So I'll keep it straight
It hurts to let go, but it
Hurts more to stay
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I know my rear view
Can't compare to
What God will do with my life
I am forgetting
What's behind me
I have finally decided
I'll be
Movin on
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
My mother told me
She taught me well
Forget your failures
Forgive yourself
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
I know my rear view
Can't compare to
What God will do with my life
now I am forgetting
What's behind me
I have finally decided
I'll be
I know my rear view
Can't compare to
What God will do with my life
I am forgetting
What's behind me
I have finally decided
I'll be
 movin on
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
Know that I will be
Know I will
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
Forgetting what's behind me
Focusing on what's inside me
Christ the head and I'm just in this body
Never will the love be spotty
I pride myself on bringing light to your parties
Holy Ghost rectify the mind, I'm naughty
Without ya
It's powder, I'm a dry land
Without your power I'm a night man
Nothing but trouble saying 'bye man'
Can't have two miles on the die man
My brother called me I could cry man
Told me we movin, I'm in God's hands
Told me we movin, I'm in God's hands
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
Where my movin' truck at?
Gotta go
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
I'm movin on
Told me we movin, I'm in God's hands
