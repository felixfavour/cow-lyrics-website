You are good in all things perfect
Oh, I can trust Your promise
I’ve never seen You turn away
You have loved me undeserving
Oh, I have seen Your mercy
Follow me all my days
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it doesn’t make sense
How Your love is so good
You called me Your friend
And I thought I was too far gone
Now I know You’re never gonna let me go
You are good
And You can only be good
You can’t be anything else
You can’t be anything else
Hindsight’s always 20/20
Oh, I can look behind me
And see just how far I’ve come
You’ve savеd me from the brink of falling
Mercy shutting doors bеfore me
Now I see all the good You’ve done
