Chorus:
Persecuted but not forsaken
Cast down but not destroyed
I have something this world can't away from me. 2x
No matter how hard you try you can take it
I may even have to cry but I I'll make it
There's joy for my sorrow
Hope for tomorrow
I have something this world can't take away.....
Chorus 1x
In the midst of my trials I will be alright
In the midst of my pain I know I will I'll survive
There's joy for my sorrow
I have hope for my tomorrow
I have something this world can't away.....
Chorus:
Persecuted but not forsaken
Cast down but not destroyed
I have something this world can't take 2x
I have something this world can't take away from me
