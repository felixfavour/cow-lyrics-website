My heart was heavy with desperation
Just too ashamed to lift my head
'Til all my chains were finally broken
As I prayed the sinner's prayer
Oh God, have mercy on me
Oh God, have mercy on me right now
'Cause I just need a place to lay my weary head
So God, have mercy on me
Have mercy on me now
Have mercy on me now
You weren't looking for a holy roller
With a point of pride to prove (But oh)
How irresistible to grace is failure
To hear a sinner singing, "God, I need You"So God, have mercy on me
God, have mercy on me right now
'Cause I just need a place to lay my weary head
And I just need a place to raise my empty hands
So have mercy on me now
