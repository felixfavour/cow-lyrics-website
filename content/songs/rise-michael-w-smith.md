Walk across the shore
Walk across the sea
Stand upon the waves
And walk with me
Journey through the door
Come see what I can see
All the reasons we were made
Who we were meant to be
Rise, He's calling you to go
Just leave it all behind
And rise above
Beyond the obvious
And what you can attain
Past the here and now
Where faith remains
Lift your weary head
There's too much left to lose
More than you can imagine
It's waiting there for you
Rise, He's calling you to come
Just leave it all behind
And rise above
