You sustain the whole world in your hand
And in your breath there is life
Your power no one can contend
At the sound of your voice darkness flees
You sustain the whole world in your hand
And in your breath there is life
Your power no one can contend
At the sound of your voice darkness flees
So come in your glory, come in your majesty
Come in the greatness of your mighty name
Come in your splendour full of authority (Oh Lord God)
Come in the power flowing in your blood
Baba fagba ra rẹ han
Baba fagba ra rẹ han
Baba fagba ra rẹ han
Baba fagba ra rẹ han
The Hills and mountains (The hills and mountains skip like rams)
The seas they make way when you turn
The raging storms they become shy
The raging storms they become shy
And at your word Lord
And at your word they keep still (They keep still)
For you are a God
You are a God and nothing is hard for you
Maker of all the earth
Maker of all the Heavens and the earth
Oh come oh come
Come in your fullness, come in your sovereignty
Come let the whole world know
Come let the whole world know that you are God
