No matter if the crowds are gone curtains drawn
If no one knows my name
And if I’m forgotten by the whole world wide
I will tell you, what I do
As long as there is
Still one breath in me there always will be
One more song for you
Like no one is listening we down to just the two
If you want to hear it
I will sing it from my spirit for you;
Eh, eh, For you oh..yeah, yeah
Cause whether I’m rich or poor
Young or old, infamous or faint
And whether I’m in distress
Over blessed
I’ll love you and I’ll serve you
As long as there is
Still one breath in me there always will be
One more song for you
Like no one is listening we down to just the two
If you want to hear it
I will sing it from my spirit for you;
