What a mighty God we serve
What a mighty God we serve
What a mighty God we serve
What a mighty God we serve
Angels bow before Him
Heaven and earth adore Him
What a mighty God we serve
What a mighty God we serve
He holds the winds in His hand
And He is the great I am
He is the bright and morning star
And without Him I would fall
Angels bow before Him
Heaven and earth adore Him
What a mighty God we serve
What a mighty God we serve
He holds the winds in His hand
And He is the great I am
He is the bright and morning star
And without Him I would fall
