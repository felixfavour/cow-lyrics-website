I'm gonna be free
I'm gonna be free
Loose my from chains
Cleanse me from my stains
Heal me from my shame
Yeah
Give me wings to try
Point me to the sky
Cheer me as I fly
Cause I'm, I'm gonna be free
No boundry of slavery
Can't hold back my liberty
Because who the Son sets free
Is absolutely free indeed
That they cannot take from me
Cause I, I, I'm gonna be free
Tell me what you know
Give me seeds to sow
Leave me room to grow
Oh
