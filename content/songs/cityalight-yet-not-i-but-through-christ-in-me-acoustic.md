what gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer
There is no more for heaven now to give
He is my joy ,my righteousness and freedom
My steadfast love ,my deep and boundless  peace
 To this I hold ,my hope is only Jesus
For my life is wholly bound to his
Oh how strange and devine, I can sing  All is mine" Yet not I but through christ in me,
The night is dark but I am not forsaken
For by my side, the savior he will stay
 I labour  on in weakness and  rejoicing
For in my need his power is displayed
 To this I hold my shepherd will defend me
Through the deepest valley he will lead
 Oh the night has been won ,and I shall overcome
 Yet not i but through christ in me
No fate I dread I know I am forgiven
The future sure, the price it has been paid
 For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
 And he was raised to overthrow the grave
 To this I hold ,my sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea
Oh the chains are released, I can sing  I am free "
Yet not I but through christ in me
With every breath I long to follow Jesus
  For he has said that he would bring me home
And day by day I know he will renew me
Until I stand with joy before the throne
 To this I hold my hope is only Jesus
All the   glory evermore to him
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I but through christ in me
To this I hold my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to him
When the race is complete still my lips shall repeat Yet not I but through christ in me
When the race is complete still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I but through christ in ,yet not I but through christ in me ,yet not I but through christ in meee
