Tell rich and poor in slavery
The King has ordered a decree
Ransom all captivity
Ring the bells of liberty
He sacrificed His everything
To buy us new identities
So every knee could bow
And every tongue confess
That Jesus our Lord is marvelous
So let the redeemed of the Lord, say so
Talk about it, say so, talk, talk about it
Let the redeemed of the Lord, say so
Talk about it, say so, talk, talk about it
Bangladesh to Bangor, Maine
If you're talking about His name
Give Him glory unashamed
His love is so exciting
Say it loud and quietly
Nod you head or disagree
