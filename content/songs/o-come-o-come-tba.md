1 O come, O come, Emmanuel, And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.

Refrain
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

2 O come, Thou Wisdom from on high,
Who orderest all things mightily; To us the path of knowledge show, 
And teach us in her ways to go.

Refrain
3 O come, Thou Rod of Jesse,
free.
Thine own from Satan’s
tyranny;
From depths of hell Thy people
save,
And give them victory over the grave.

Refrain
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

4 O come, Thou Day-spring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent
here;
Disperse the gloomy
clouds of night,
And death’s dark shadows
put to flight.

Refrain
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

5 O come, Thou Key of David,
come,
And open wide our heavenly
home;
Make safe the way that leads on high,
And close the path to misery.

Refrain
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

6 O come, O come, great Lord of might,
Who to Thy tribes on Sinai’s
height
In ancient times once gave the law
In cloud and majesty and awe.

Refrain
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

7 O come, Thou Root of Jesse’s
tree,
An ensign of Thy people
be;
Before Thee rulers silent
fall;
All peoples on Thy mercy
call.

Refrain
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

8 O come, Desire of nations,
bind
In one the hearts of all mankind;
Bid Thou our sad divisions
cease,
And be Thyself our king of Peace.

Refrain
Rejoice! Rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
