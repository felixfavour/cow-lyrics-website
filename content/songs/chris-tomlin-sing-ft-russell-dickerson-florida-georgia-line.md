First thing in the morning 'till the end of the day
There's a heavenly little melody to the rhythm of Your praise
And I gave You my heart, and something's different ever since
I can't keep Hallelujah off my lips, now
You make me wanna sing
All about Your love
Make me wanna tell the whole world what You've done
How You turned my life around
I was lost, but now I'm found
You're the song stuck inside my head all day
Yeah, You make me wanna sing
Sing
Sing all about You
Yeah, You make me wanna sing
Free as a free bird, faith like a child
Your love is a river, and that river's running wild
People think I'm crazy for the way I'm acting lately
That's true, I'm crazy 'bout You, and
You make me wanna sing
All about Your love
Make me wanna tell the whole world what You've done
How You turned my life around
I was lost, but now I'm found
You're the song stuck inside my head all day
Yeah, You make me wanna sing
Sing
Sing all about You
Yeah, You make me wanna sing
Oh, yes You do, whoo
I gave You my heart and something's different ever since
I can't keep Hallelujah off my lips, now
You make me wanna sing (sing)
All about Your love (all about Your love)
Make me wanna tell the whole world what You've done
How You turned my life around (life around)
I was lost, but now I'm found (now I'm found)
You're the song stuck inside my head all day (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, You make me wanna sing
Sing, sing, sing
Sing all about You (all about you)
Yeah, You make me wanna sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing all about You
Yeah, You make me wanna sing
Yeah, You make me wanna sing
Aww, yeah, you make me wanna sing
