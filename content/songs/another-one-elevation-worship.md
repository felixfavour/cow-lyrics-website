You do everything on purpose
I can feel Your spirit stirring
I've been praying, You've been working
You're working it all for good
So fan the flame and keep it burning
You're refining in the furnace
All the waiting will be worth it
'Cause You're working it all for good
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Miracle after miracle
Open door after open door
Here it comes, so get ready for another one
'Cause another one is on the way
Miracle after miracle
Open door after open door
Here it comes, so get ready for another one
'Cause another one is on the way
[Interlude: Chris Brown]
Oh, another one is on the way
Oh
Oh, rushing wind and living water
You're the God of signs and God of wonders
If You will it, what can stop it?
'Cause You're working it all for good
Yeah, You're working it all for good
