In the middle of the trial
We find a place to laugh
In the art of wicked justice
We forged ahead to grow
Bumpy roads and darkened homelands
Don't kill our will you know
Still we got to go (ooo oooo)
When the road that stands before you looks like it never ends
When the fire will devour you
All so it seems my friend
With the more you sing
The more you will make that trouble end
Sing and let it end (o yeah)
I am glad
Glad to walk the earth
I am glad
That I was born in Nigeria
I am glad
Glad to be alive
Glad that I was born (oooo yeah)
I am glad
Oooo I am happy
I am glad
To be a part of destiny
I am glad
Glad to have the earth
Glad that I was born (ooo oooo) Add or View Explanation In the absence of a visa
When no where left to go
