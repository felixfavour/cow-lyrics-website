Red blanket -Phil Thompson
Sitting here
don't know how i made it over
wondering
wondering
have i lost my way
is it north or is it south?
and which road should i take
is this my faith?
but you placed inside of me
a storm kit that I've held on to
my own proverbial red blanket
and when it seems all hope
was lost
Chorus
You gave me hope
riches unspeakable
love that's unstoppable
more than you'll ever know
ohhhh
you gave me Christ
weapons with which to fight
you taught me sacrifice
love that will never die
And when times got hard
you taught me how
to worship God
When times got hard
you taught me how
to worship God
Verse 2
Looking back
thinking of all the stuff I've been through
Pondering
what could have been
but I've learnt along the way
that through the storm and in the valley
I cant loose my faith
and I'll give God praise
You placed inside of me
a storm kit that I've held on to
my own proverbial red blanket
and when it seems all hope was lost
Chorus
You gave me hope
riches unspeakable
love that's unstoppable
More than you'll ever know
Oh you gave me Christ
Weapons with which to fight
You taught me sacrifice
Love that will never die
When times got hard
you taught me how
 to worship God.
When times got hard
you taught me how
to worship God.
Interlude...
You gave me hope
riches unspeakable
love that's unstoppable
more than you'll ever know
oh you gave me Christ
Weapons with which to fight
you taught me sacrifice
love that will never die.
when times got hard
you taught me how
to worship God
ohhh
 i know when times got hard
that i can get on my knees
that i can look to you Lord
oh i worship God....
