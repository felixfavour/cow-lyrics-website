House on Fire by JayMikee
      Verse 1
We are living in a world that is complicated
The right seems wrong and the wrong seems right it's complicated
Different philosophies and ideologies of identities
This is where we are it is the world that we live in
We are living in a world of countless decisions
Where to go and who to follow who to trust
All that everybody knows everyone knows that the clock is ticking
So choose this day who you will be serving
  Chorus
As for me and my house(aaayyy)
As for me and my house we will serve the Lord (aaayyy )
As for me and my house there is no other God(aaayyy)
As for me and my house we will serve the Lord .We will serve the Lord
Living in a house on fire
We are living in a house on fire (4)
    Verse 2
We are living in the final times and seasons
Where many peoples love for God will begin to weaken
All that everybody knows everyone knows that the clock is ticking
So if you are not serving the Lord then whom are you serving?
    Chorus
As for me and my house(aaayyy)
As for me and my house we will serve the Lord (aaayyy )
As for me and my house there is no other God(aaayyy)
As for me and my house we will serve the Lord .We will serve the Lord
Living in a house on fire
We are living in a house on fire
