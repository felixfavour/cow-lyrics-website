God will make a way
Where there seems to be no way
He works in ways we cannot see
He will make a way for me
He will be my guide
Hold me closely to His side
With love and strength for each new day
Oh, He will make a way
God will make a way
Where there seems to be no way
He cares for you, He understands
He'll hold you in His loving hands
He will do for you
(He will do)
What no other friend can do
(No other friend can do)
With love and strength for еach new day
He will make a way
Hе will make a way
By a roadway in the wilderness
He’ll lead me
And rivers in the desert will I see
Heaven and earth will fade
But His Word will still remain
He will do something new today
