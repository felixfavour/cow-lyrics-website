YOU ARE
CHORUS
You are the love of my life.
You are the hope that I cling to
You mean,more than this world to me
I wouldn't trade you for sliver or gold
I wouldn't trade you for riches untold
You are,you are my everything.x2
I couldn't take one step with you
I could never go on.
I couldn't live one day without you
I don't have the strength to make it on my own.
REPEAT CHORUS
Until the world stops turning.
Until the stars,fade from the sky
Until the sun stops striving
I will need you in my life,here's the reason why
       REPEAT CHORUS TILL THE
        SONG FADE AWAY
