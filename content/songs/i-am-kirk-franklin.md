How do you do
I am a sinner
Born into sin and shaped in iniquity
Now I believe not who I was but still not what I shall be
You found me and gave me your name and
Things I desired have changed but
Inside you'll see it's still broken pieces
Deep in me reaches for you
How do you do
I am a beggar
Desperate for more
I hunger for your truth
See I am shattered
Though I may fall still you make all things new
You speak, the storm, it obeys and ..
There is no way to mistake
Though I still feel you continue to heal, look close and see, whoa
I am so far from perfect
I thought life is worthless
Until you showed me who I am
Not here by mistake
No luck only grace
I'm on my way to
Who I am
I am
I am
I am
Thank God I am
I am, I am
