[Instrumental]
Your voice ever close, You called me
You never gave up, pursuing
I fell in love, You stole my heart
Your hand ever near, I hold to
I long for Your heart, to know You
Just to live in Your fellowship
Just to be close to You
And just to walk next to You
Oh this is my one thing
You are my one thing
And just to be close to You
Just to walk next to You
Oh this is my one thing
You are my one thing
My eyes ever fixed upon You
To live like a child, to trust you
Oh I hold on to this treasured love
My life ever set at Your feet
I give you my heart completely
To live this life always by Your side
