You invite me to the table
To fill my cup again
And oh, to be here with the Savior
And be welcomed as a friend
[Pre-Chorus]
All that my heart can say is thank You
All that my heart can say is thank You
Thank You, Jesus
How marvelous, how wonderful
How precious is the blood
How precious is the blood
It washes me, what a miracle
How precious is the blood
How precious is the blood of Jesus
Oh, the blood of Jesus
Your body broken, arms open
As You hung there on a tree
And through the suffering, through the crushing
That You would think of me
