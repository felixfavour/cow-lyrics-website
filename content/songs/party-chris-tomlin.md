You got one word
We're gonna party
We're gonna party
I can feel it down inside
We're gonna party
I was dead now I'm alive
Gonna outshout the heavens now
Gonna sing loud and drown the sea out
Gonna celebrate the life I found
I'm found, I'm found
I was blind but now I see
I was lost but He rescued me
He saved the day and He set me free
Set me free, now I'm free
We're gonna party
I can feel it down inside
Party
I was dead now I'm alive
Gonna outshout the heavens now
Gonna sing loud and drown the sea out
Gonna celebrate the life I found
I'm found, I'm found
