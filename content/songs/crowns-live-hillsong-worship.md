There is a hill I cherish
Where stood a precious tree
The emblem of Salvation
The gift of Calvary
How is it I should profit?
While He is crucified
Yet as His life was taken
So I was granted mine
My wealth is in the cross
There's nothing more I want
Than just to know His love
My heart is set on Christ
And I will count all else as loss
The greatest of my crowns
Mean nothing to me now
For I counted up the cost
And all my wealth is in the cross
I will not boast in riches
I have no pride in gold
But I will boast in Jesus
And in His Name alone
