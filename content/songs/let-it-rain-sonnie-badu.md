If this is your power
If this is your glory
If this is your presence
Then let it rain Let it rain all over, let it rain all over me
Let it rain all over, let it rain all over me
Let it rain all over, let it rain all over me (continue)
If this is your power
If this is you glory
If this is your presence, let it rain
Let it rain all over me
Let it rain all over me
Break me, mould me, fill me use me
Break me, mould me, fill me use me
Break me, mould me, fill me use me
Use me for your glory
Let it rain on me
