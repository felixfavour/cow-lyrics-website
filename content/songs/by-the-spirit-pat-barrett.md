I’m standing here with open arms
I’m learning where my help comes from
And I’m singing like the battle’s won, oh
'Cause I’m learning where my strength comes from
Not by power
Not by might
By the Spirit of God
Up to the heavens
I lift my eyes
Fully surrendered
All of my life
I’m laughing in the face of fear
'Cause Your perfect love is with me here, oh
And I’m living in Your victory
'Cause heaven is surrounding me
Not by powеr
Not by might
By the Spirit of God
Up to the heavеns
I lift my eyes
Fully surrendered
All of my life
