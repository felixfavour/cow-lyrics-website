V1
The   Lord   reigns,   the   Lord   reigns
And   all   the   earth   rejoices
Higher,   higher
Your   name   be   glorified
The   Lord   reigns,   the   Lord   reigns
Creation   lift   your   voices
Louder,   louder
Your   praise   be   amplified
Chorus
Rejoice,   rejoice
Rejoice   in   the   Lord
And   be   glad
Rejoice,   rejoice
Rejoice   In   the   Lord
Singing
He   has   made   me   glad,   he   has   made   me   glad
Bridge
Oh   taste   and   see
Oh   taste   and   see
I   know   God   is   good
He’s   so   good   to   me
Oh   taste   and   see
Oh   taste   and   see
I   know   God   is   good
He’s   so   good   to   me
