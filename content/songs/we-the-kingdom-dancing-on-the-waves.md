I'm standing at your door
My heart is calling yours
Come fall into my arms
You're weary from it all
Been running for so long
I'm here to bring you home
I'm reaching out
I'll chase you down
I dare you to believe how much I love you now
Don't be afraid
I am your strength
we'll be walking on the water
Dancing on the waves
Look up and lift your eyes
The future's open wide
I have great plans for you
  oh yes I do
Your past is dead and gone
Your healing has begun
I'm making all things new
    oh oh oh oh oh
I'm reaching out
I'll chase you down
I dare you to believe how much I love you now
  oh oh oh oh
Don't be afraid
I am your strength
we'll be walking on the water
Dancing on the waves
2x
(can you see us just dancing)
I set every star into place
So you would remember my name
I made it all for you
You are my masterpiece
You are the reason I sing
This is my song for you
(every star in the sky)
I'm reaching out
I'll chase you down
I dare you to believe how much I love you now
Don't be afraid
I am your strength
we'll be walking on the water
Dancing on the waves
oh we're walking on the water
 dancing on the waves
