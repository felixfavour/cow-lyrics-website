A*aw
I overcame, hallelujah
He won the victory, hallelujah
He said it's finished and oh ohhh
My story is written and oh ohhh
I overcame, hallelujah
I overcame, hallelujah
Hallelujah he's alive
And because he lives I live
Hallelujah Jesus lives
And my future is alive in him
I overcame, hallelujah
He won the victory, hallelujah
He said it's finished and oh ohhh
My story is written and oh ohhh
I overcame, hallelujah
I overcame, hallelujah
Say to the mountain, I overcame
Say to the problem, you came too late
Tell that sickness, I already won
Declaring boldly, I'm born of God
He said it's finished and oh ohhh
My story's written and oh ohhh
I overcame, hallelujah
I overcame, hallelujah
Hallelujah, he's alive
And because he lives I live
Hallelujah, he's alive
And because he lives I live
Hallelujah, Jesus lives
And because he lives I live
He said it's finished and oh ohhh
My story's written and oh ohhh
He said it's finished and oh ohhh
My story's written and oh ohhh
I overcame, hallelujah
I overcame, hallelujah
I overcame, hallelujah
I overcame, hallelujah
Ahhhhh
It is finished
Yea yea
