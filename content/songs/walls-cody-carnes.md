We are daughters and sons
Singing as one, we've got a hope now
Walls have tried to divide
But nothing can hide the power that we've found
You are walking with us
And all of the walls are turning to dust
They are faling down
Sing praise, we sing praise
We fill the skies with songs from our hearts
Sing praise, we sing praise
'Til enemies know how faithful you are, oh God
I will lift up your name
Put darkness in chains
You go before us
And love is swallowing fear
And all of the walls will soon disappear
They are crumbling down
Sing praise, we sing praise
We fill the skies with songs from our hearts
Sing praise, we sing praise
'Til enemies know how faithful you are, oh God
