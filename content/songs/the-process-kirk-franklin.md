Let it Go
My mama gave me up when I was four years old
She didn't destroy my body but she killed my soul
Now it cold cause Im slipping in my back seat
I understand the spirits willing but my flesh is weak (let me speak)
Never had a chance to dream 10 years old and finding love in dirty magazines
Ms December remember I bought you twice
Now I'm 30 plus and I'm still paying the price
Had a sister that I barely knew
Kind of got separated by the age of two
Same mama different daddy
.......
Saw my sisters daddy beat her naked
Taking serious the Demonds in a mans mind
The same man with rape charges now he's doing time
Crack followed and like daddy prison 13 years
Haven't seen her cause she's traded tears for fears
Shout shout let it all out
These are the things I can do without
So come on (come on)
Now I'm talking to you so come on
Sex was how I made i through
I wasn't the one to teach with love but said this one ought to do
See where I'm from the call you gay say you ain't a man
Show em you ain't no punk get all the girls you can
This simple plan even hunts me even now today
Back to 17 and got a baby on the way
Well dear God all I see is failure in my eyes
If your listening and remember I apologize
I was raise all in a church
Made mistakes and heard the Lords cold .....
After service on the parking lot getting high
Wanting to be accepted so bad i was willing to die
Even thrived to tell the pastor but he couldn't see
Years of low self-esteem and Insecurity
Church taught me how to stop and speak in tongues
Preacher teach me how to live when the tongue is done
