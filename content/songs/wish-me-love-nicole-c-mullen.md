You know to me somehow
It seems to me they change
Just the way the story should be
In my mind it's clear I still remember
What I’ve done and what he did to me
And yet my heart did survive
Through the tug of war
When push came to love
Love came to shove
And it hurt too much to stay
'Cause even strong hearts surrender
When they get hated away
So maybe wish me love
Wish me love, wish me love
And I'll be okay
Wish me love, wish me love
Tell me, am I dreaming loud enough
For you to wish me love
(You don’t wish me love)
Gone again, this time you say it's over
Gone for good or playing goodbye
Baby, I can see you really love him
But going back could be a disguise
