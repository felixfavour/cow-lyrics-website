Lord rend the heavens
Rain down on us now
That the mountains might shake
As Your glory comes down
We've heard of Your wonders
Your works and Your ways
We're desperate for You Lord
To move in our day
Move Spirit move
Move Spirit move
Move in us among us
Touch the world through us
Without You we can't find our way
Move Spirit move today
Jesus we need You
Much more than we know
If we don't have You
Then where can we go
We're anticipating all that You'll do
Turn to our cry Lord
We're turning to You
Move Spirit move
Move Spirit move
Move in us among us
Touch the world through us
Without You we can't find our way
Move Spirit move today
