[Chorus]
I am not my own
I was bought with a price
I was purchased with the precious
Blood of Jesus Christ
All my debts were paid
By His sacrifice
Hallelujah to the Lamb
Who redeems my life
I am not my own
I was bought with a price
I was purchased with the precious
Blood of Jesus Christ
All my debts were paid
By His sacrifice
Hallelujah to the Lamb
Who redeems my life
I am not my own
I was bought with a price
I was purchased with the precious
Blood of Jesus Christ
All my debts were paid
By His sacrifice
Hallelujah to the Lamb
Who redeems my life
