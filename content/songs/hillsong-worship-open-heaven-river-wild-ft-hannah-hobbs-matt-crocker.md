Signs and wonders from above
When You poured out Your Spirit
On the old and the young
In the power of Your presence
Holy Spirit rain
Falling like a flood
Break upon my praise
As I sing of Your love
Holy Spirit fire
Burn within my soul
As I call on Your Name
As I call on Your Name
Dreams and visions of the Son
As I stand in Your presence
Revelations of Your love
As I look to the heavens
Holy Spirit rain
Falling like a flood
Break upon my praise
As I sing of Your love
Holy Spirit fire
Burn within my soul
As I call on Your Name
As I call on Your Name
As I call on Your Name
As I call on Your Name
Jesus
Oh Holy Spirit
Burn like a fire
All consuming
Consume me
Here in Your presence
Lord I surrender
To Your glory
For Your glory
Oh Holy Spirit
Burn like a fire
All consuming
Consume me
