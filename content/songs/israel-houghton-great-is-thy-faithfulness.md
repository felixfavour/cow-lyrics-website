Great is thy faithfulness oh God my father
There is no shadow of turning with thee
Thou changest not thy compassion they fail not
As thou has been thou forever will be
 CHORUS
Great is thy faithfulness
Great is thy faithfulness
Morning by morning new mercies I see
All I have needed thy hands have provided
   2. Summer and  winter, spring time and harvest
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above
Join with all nature in manifold witness
To thy great faithfulness, mercy and love
   Back to chorus
Lord you are faithful, faithful to me
(Xxx)
