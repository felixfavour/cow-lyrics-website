Your love has won my heart forever
Not because of anything I’vedone
But You have scaled the hills and mountains
Just to search and find the one You love
Chorus:
I belong to You, I belong to You
I belong to You, forever Yours
And when I was drowning in my doubt
Your mighty right hand lifted me out
And now we are walking on the water
‘Cause you lift my head above the crowd
And when this life is over
And I stand to see You face to face
There’s nothing that I will have wanted
But to be with the One
I belong to always
