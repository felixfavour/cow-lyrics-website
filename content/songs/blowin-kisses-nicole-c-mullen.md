Walkin' down Broadway
I saw a mom and her baby
She came up to me
And asked me for a dime
I said now come on
I'll take you to this diner
Gave her more than food
It cost me 6 o' 5
People don't need just money, people need love and time
Spent a little time with the hurting honey and got myself love-a-fied
Now I'm
(Chorus)
Blowin' kisses to the one I love
Blowin' kisses to the father above
Helpin' others to feel His touch
Blowin' kisses to the one I love
Well, she said their names
Were Rachel and Little Nikki
I said, "Hey, that's strange
Cause Niki's my name too"
As she turned to go
She spoke the words of blessing
With an angel's voice, she said
"I see the Christ in you"
