You are great 
You do miracles so great 
There is no one else like you
There is no one else like you

You reign you ancient Zion's king.
Kadosh kadosh. You are mighty on your throne 

Break forth oh spirit of the King. we cry out kadosh . You are mighty on your throne.

You are mighty on your Throne 4x

Amen amen 
Blessings and Glory 

with some thanksgiving and honour.
Power and might be unto the Lord. Forever and ever. Amen

Jesus must be honored.
Must be honored 2x

Jesus must be honored in my life everyday

Water you turn into wine.
Open the eyes of the blind. There's no one like you.

Into the darkness you shine
Out of the ashes we rise.
There's no one like you

Our God is greater
Our God is stronger 

Lord you are higher than any other

Our God is greater 
Our God is stronger 

Our God
