LEND ME YOUR EAR
THUS SAYETH THE LORD
JUST KNOW THAT MY WORD
WILL NOT RETURN VOID
THE TIME I'VE SUSTAINED
THERE'S NO NEED TO FEAR
I'M RESTORING THE YEARS
YOU'VE SEWN IN TEARS
RESTORING THE YEARS
YOU'VE SEWN IN TEARS
I AM THE AUTHOR
THE WRITER OF TIME
NO MATTER HOW LONG
THINGS WILL WORK OUT JUST FINE
DEPOSIT THIS WORD
THERE'S NO NEED TO FEAR
I'M RESTORING THE YEARS
YOU'VE SEWN IN TEARS
RESTORING THE YEARS
YOU'VE SEWN IN TEARS
LIFT UP YOUR HANDS
RECEIVE FROM THE LORD
YOUR BROKEN SPIRIT
RECEIVE THIS WORD FROM THE LORD
DEPOSIT THIS WORD
THERE'S NO NEED TO FEAR
I'M RESTORING THE YEARS
YOU'VE SEWN IN TEARS
RESTORING THE YEARS
YOU'VE SEWN IN TEARS
I'M HEALING YOU
HEALING YOU
I'M RESTORING THE YEARS
YOU'VE SEWN IN TEARS
RESTORING THE YEARS
YOU'VE SEWN IN TEARS
