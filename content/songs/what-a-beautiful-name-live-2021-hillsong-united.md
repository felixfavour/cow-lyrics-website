[Bridge]
Death could not hold You
The veil tore before You
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring
The praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again
You have no rival (Let 'em know)
You have no equal
Now and forever, God, You reign
'Cause Yours is the Kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names
Oh, death could never
Death could not hold you
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
Thе heavens are roaring
Thе praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again
'Cause you have no rival
'Cause you have no equal
Now and forever, God, You reign
'Cause Yours is the Kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names
