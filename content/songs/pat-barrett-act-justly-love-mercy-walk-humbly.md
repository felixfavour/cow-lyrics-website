It all comes down to this
What you require of me
Love my neighbor as myself
And You above all things
Act justly, love mercy, walk humbly
With You, God
In all things, in all ways, walk humbly
With You, God
It all comes down to this
To be Your hands and feet
Good news to all the world
The truth will set us free
Act justly, love mercy, walk humbly
With You, God
In all things, in all ways, walk humbly
With You, God
It's beauty for ashes
It's mourning to dancing
It's closer and closer
The Kingdom of heaven
It's beauty for ashes
It's mourning to dancing
It's closer and closer
The Kingdom of heaven
And years from now we'll see
The fruit our hands have sown
Faith just like a seed
The only way it grows
Act justly, love mercy, walk humbly
With You, God
In all things, in all ways, walk humbly
With You, God
