Strength for all the weak
Love for all the least
Hope that's never failing
Grace for everyone
There's power in the blood
Freedom for the captives
Jesus, Jesus
There's nothing more to say
Jesus, Jesus
I'll never be the same
Jesus, Jesus
Treasure in my hands
Life that never ends
Mercy everlasting
The lamb who takes our sin
Where life begins again
A Kingdom never ending
Jesus, Jesus
There's nothing more to say
Jesus, Jesus
I'll never be the same
Jesus, Jesus
