Mali, let's go get 'em!
Gimme that joy I can't explain
Add extra peace that'll ease my pain
I want that love that'll never change
Give me that, Give me that
Give me that power to walk away
When another god wants to take your place
As much of you as I can take
Give me that, Give me that
Oh oh oh
Anybody ready
Oh oh oh
Ready for his glory
Oh oh oh
If you're a seeker for life
Oh oh oh
Let me tell you this story
Oh oh oh
Every place that's dark
Oh oh oh
He will bring it to light
Oh oh oh
Hypocritical hearts, backs sliders, liars it's time to get right
Oh oh oh
See I include myself
Oh oh oh
I cast my own stones
Oh oh oh
I'm the man in the mirror y'all
Oh oh oh
I can see my wrong
Oh oh oh
But I'm here by grace
Oh oh oh
Through Christ by faith
Oh oh oh
