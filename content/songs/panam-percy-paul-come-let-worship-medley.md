Come let us worship and bow down
Let us kneel before the Lord our God our maker
Glory and splendor and majesty
Thou O Lord art the king of all creation
For He is our God
We are the sheep of His pasture
And he is the Lord of all creation
Come let us worship and bow down
Let us kneel before the Lord our God our maker
Father, Father
God of all creation
Unto thee we worship
Power, glory
Lord we give to you-ou-ou our God
Jesus, Jesus
Son of God almighty
Conqueror and captain
Power, glory
Lord we give to you-ou-ou our God
Holy, Spirit
You are the sweet communion
You are powerful and gentle
Power, glory
Lord we give to you-ou-ou our God
I will bless You Lord
For you are my God
Creator of my soul
I exalt your name
Glory unto you
Forever you are the same
God of gods we pray
Lord, You are holy
Lord, You are worthy
You are God forever

Glory unto you
Forever you are the same
God of gods we pray
