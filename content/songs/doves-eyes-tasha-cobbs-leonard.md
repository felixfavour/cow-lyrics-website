I don't wanna talk about You
Like You're not in the room
I wanna look right at You
I wanna sing right to You
I don't wanna talk about You
Like You're not in the room
I wanna look right at You
I wanna sing right to You
Don't wanna talk about You
Like You're not in the room
I wanna look right at You
I wanna sing right to You
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I believe, You are listening
And I believe, that You move at the sound of my voice, yeah
I believe, You are listening, yeah
And I believe, that You move at the sound
So give me dove's eyes
Give me undistracted devotion
For only You
Give me dove's eyes (that's what I want, Lord)
Give me undistracted devotion
For only You
It's all about You
