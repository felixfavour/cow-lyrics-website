No praise can define You
No thought can contain You, God
No other one is Holy
No other one is robed in righteousness
God, You are my God
Glorious, glorious
No lights can outshine You
No power can defeat You, God
No other one is Holy
And no other one is high and lifted up
God, You are my God
Glorious, glorious
God, You are my God
Victorious, victorious
[Bridge]
From the dawn of time, You reign
To the end of days, You're the God who saves, sing
All the earth will shout Your praise
You will never change
You're the God who saves, sing
From the dawn of time, You reign
To the end of days, You're the God who saves, sing
All the earth will shout Your praise
You will never change
You're the God who saves
