You unravel me
with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance
from my enemies
'Til all my fears are gone.
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
From my mother's womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I've been born again
Into your family
Your blood flows through my veins.
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I am surrounded
By the arms of the Father
I am surrounded
By songs of
Deliverance
We're deliver-ed
From our bondage
We're the sons and the daughters
Let us sing our freedom
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
Bridge:
You split the sea so I could walk right through it.
My fears are drowned in perfect love.
You rescued me and I will stand and sing.
I am a child of God.
You split the sea so I could walk right through it.
You drowned my fears in perfect love.
You rescued me and I will stand and sing.
I am a child of God.
Yes, I am.
I am a child of God.
I am a child of God.
Yes, I am.
I am a child of God.
I am a child of God.
I am a child of God.
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
