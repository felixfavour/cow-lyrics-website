So God is saying he has seen your
 worship he has seen your praise
He has seen the activities
He has seen your desires your passion
But he's calling us for more
He's calling us to deeper in him
He's calling us to the place of intimacy a place of sincerity
He has seen that we have done all we have done
But he wants us to go deeper
He wants us to do this things in spirit and in truth
He is calling us to a place that you know ..  you know a place of brokenness
A place where we love him sincerely
A place where beyond the red carpet beyond the stadium
We are sincere about our worship on our life's
A place where we come broken
A place where we come notwithstanding what we have been through
Notwithstanding what we have achieved
We are bowing our heads and our crowns to him knowing that he's God over our life's
He's calling us to that place where
Nothing else matters
He's calling us to that place where social media does not matter anymore trends don't matter
He's calling us to a place where
 ABBA is our portion
 ABBA is our desire
 ABBA is the name we call
whenever in needy
whenever we seek his face
He's calling us to the place of father
And son relationship
Father and daughter relationship
A place where my words don't matter
My streams don't matter the downloads don't matter
A place where the crowd in my church does not matter
A place of sincerity
A place where our prides does not matter
He's calling us to a place of sincerity
A place where our ego does not matter
It's all about kingdom
It's all about his will
Is all about his desires
A place where all the things we boast about does not matter
He's calling us for more
The place where forgiveness
 Becomes bread becomes butter
You freely forgive you freely let go
You are calling us to that place where we are praying for the body of Christ
You are calling us to that place where
A minister is up there ministering
And we are interceding for that minister
A preacher is ministering up there
And we are interceding
Because we are all we have
Because in this body it is not about who is bigger who is stronger
Who is better
Is about how we complete ourselves
In this body it's not about which part of us is Finner which part of us is better
As much as that is important in this body
What matters is how much we complete ourselves
God is calling us to a place of sincere
intimacy
Not the one we show in public
He's calling us to a place of deep intimacy
Spirit and truth
Not the one we show about and show off
And make people clap for us and you know give us accolades and on and on
He is calling us to a place of sincerity
Where from our hearts of hearts we are sincere with him
We love our brothers we love our neighbors
We are sincere with our worship
We are sincere with our praise
Beyond envelopes beyond accolades
Beyond stadium
He is calling us to a place
Where kingdom comes matters to us
More than anything more than the name of our churches
Teach us to forgive teach us to forbear
Teach us to endure
Teach us to support
Open our eyes to realities in you JESUS
Teach us to know that we are not perfect
But we can complete ourselves
In a time like this you are calling us for more
Help us to go deeper with you
Help us to see beyond our ego
Help us to see beyond our priories
Help us to see beyond all we have achieved
Help us to see beyond these things
Help us to see you clearly
Help us to hold fast our crown so no Man takes it because you are coming soon
THANK YOU JESUS x2
 Help us Lord God help us Lord
Take control of our body
Take control of our spirit
Take control of your body
Have your way
Help us to love like you love
Help us to forgive as you forgive
Help us to honor like you honor
Help us to teach like you teach
Help us to be humble like you are humble
Help us to be merciful like you are merciful
Help us to totally be like you
