I'm telling myself so I'll know
I speak to my heart like a daughter
Someties it's hard to let go
Sometimes the staying is harder
So farewell broken heart
This is where we must part
Fare thee well cloudy days
Moods of Blue, Shades of Gray
I thought I heard love loud and clear
It said it would be mine if only
I learn to let go of my fear
And cradle the hope of what could be
So Farewell broken heart
This is where we must part
Fare thee well cloudy days
Moods of blue, shades of gray
Rain go away
Don't come again
