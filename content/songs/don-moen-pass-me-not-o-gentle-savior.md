"Pass Me Not O Gentle Savior"
Pass me not, O gentle Savior
Here my humble Cry
While on others thou art calling
Do not pass me by
Saviour, Savior
Hear my humble cry
While on others thou art calling
Do not pass me by..(X2)
Trusting only in thy merit
Would I seek thy face
Heal my wounded, broken spirit
Save me by thy grace
Saviour, Savior hear my humble cry
While on others thou art calling
Do not pass me by...
Thou the spring of all my comfort
More than life to me
Whom have I on earth beside thee
Whom in heaven but thee
Saviour, Savior hear my humble cry
While on others thou art calling
Do not pass me by
Saviour, Savior hear my humble cry
While on others thou art calling
Do not pass me by....
