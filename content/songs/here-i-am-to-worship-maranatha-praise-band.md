Chorus:
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So You can use me
(Repeat Above)
Here I am
Here I stand
Lord, my life is in your hands
Lord, I'm longing to see
Your desires revealed in me
Chorus:
I give myself away
I give myself away
So you can use me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So you can use me
Take my heart
Take my life
As a living sacrifice
All my dreams, all my plans
Lord I place them in your hands
