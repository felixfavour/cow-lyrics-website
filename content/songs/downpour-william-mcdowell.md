We are dry and thirsty
Lord, we need a saturation
A time of refreshing
Let Your Glory rain down
Let it fill us to running over, running over
(Chorus:)
Open up the gates
Flood us with Your rain
Manifest Your Glory Lord
We're thirsty for downpour
We can see the rain clouds
As they gather overhead
We're ready to see them break
Send us living water
Let it fill us to running over, running over
(Vamp:)
Say Yes (x4)
Rain down in this place
And fill us to
Running over (x6)
