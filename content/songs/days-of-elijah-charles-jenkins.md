Behold he comes 
riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun 
at the trumpet call
So lift your voice 
it's the year of jubilee
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes

These are the days of Elijah
Preparing the word of the Lord
And these are the days 
of Your servant Moses
Righteousness being restored
And these are the days of the harvest
The fields are white in the world
And we are the laborers 
in Your vineyard
Declaring the Word of the Lord

There's no God like Jehovah
There's no God like Jehovah
There's no God like Jehovah
There's no God like Jehovah
