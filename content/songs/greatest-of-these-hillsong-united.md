I could chase after greatness
First to fall on my knees
Lose myself to be found
Where You want me
I could do all the right things
Sing the words till they bleed
But I know it's just noise
If I don't have love
[Chorus:]
So I won't waste my breath
If it's not for love
I don't have the heart
If it's not for love
Don't let me say it's faith
If it counts no cost
'Cause there's no fear in love
But there is a cross
I could speak like the angels
Prophesy knowing all
I could live with the faith
To move mountains
And should I die like a martyr
Give my wealth to the poor
It would all scream loud-nothing
If I don't have love
