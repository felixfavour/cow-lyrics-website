You are here in our midst
How we've waited for moments like this
Have Your way in this place
Holy Spirit come do as you wish
We are changed as You move in our midst
You are here among us for we have gathered in Your Name
We can feel Your presence in this place
You are here among us
You are enthroned upon Your praise
You are here, here to heal and here to save
You are here in our midst
How we've waited for moments like this
Have Your way in this place
Holy Spirit come do as you wish
We are changed as You move in our midst
