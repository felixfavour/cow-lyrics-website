Author of my destiny
You are more than enough for me
Champion of my faith, my hope
You are more than enough for me
Before I was born You chose me
I have only come this far by Your grace
In my future years to come, You hold me
You are more than enough for me
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
You are more than enough for me
Author of my destiny

Oh, the champion of my faith, my hope

Oh God, You're the reason I'm standing today (more than enough)
The rock on which I'm standing
All my days are in Your hands (more than enough)
Before I was born, You chose me
I have only come this far by Your grace
In my future years to come, You hold me (hey ay)
You are more than enough for me
You are everything I need, Jesus
My pillar, my destiny
You are my source and hope, my stay
Oh my future, You are everything
You are more than enough for me
