Let me talk to ya
Some people come out of a storm better
And some people come out of a storm bitter
The difference between the bitter and the better is the compass of your heart
And the direction that you wanna go
So let's go
See, some people wanna stay in the position of a victim
But those of us we know we are victors because we have victories, you see, haha
Becausе when you have victory, you understand that thе pain was part of the plan to make you greater
You understand that the circumstances or the weights that you kept lifting every day
And today is a new day, look at you
You had to cry, but you're smiling now
You had to go through it, but you're better now
Because you are something special
God plans ya
Even in the darkness, you are the light
Where's the light?
[Pre-Chorus: Ant Clemons]
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
Keep your eyes on the road ahead
But if you're feelin' lost in the night
It's okay to cry
Just as long as you hold your head
