Oh Lord You've searched me
You know my way
Even when I fail you
I know You love me
Your holy presence
Surrounded me
In every season
I know You love me
I know You love me
At the cross I bow my knees
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now
You go before me
You shield my way
Your hand upholds me
And I know You love me
At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this
You have overcome the grave
Your glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now
At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now
You tore the veil, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You tore the veil, You made a way
When You said that it is done
And when the earth fails
Falls from my eyes
And You stand before me
I know You love me
Oh, I know You love me
At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now
At the cross I bow my knee
Where Your blood was shed for me
There's no greater love than this, no
You have overcome the grave
Glory fills the highest praise
What can separate me now
You tore the veil, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You tore the veil, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You tore the veil, You made a way
When You said that it is done
You tore the veil, You made a way
When You said that it is done
