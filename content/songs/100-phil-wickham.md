I'm a little scared to sing this song
'Cause I know it's comin' with a cost
But You said I gotta die to live
So God, I'm pickin' up my cross
'Cause I've tasted what the world gives
The things they say that matter most
And all of it compared to You
No, it doesn't even come close
You can have it all, every single part
Givin' You a hundred percent of my heart
Anything it costs, for everything You are
You can have a hundred percent of my heart
All of my life surrendered
Jesus, I'm Yours forever
Lovеr of my soul, never-failing friend
I'm givin' You a hundrеd percent
God, I'll give You anything You ask
Nothing I have You didn't give me first
And You gladly give it all back
It's like tradin' in a star to get the universe
See me now, I'm raisin' up a white flag (A white flag)
Runnin' to You, comin' just as I am (Just as I am)
I'm a livin' sacrifice
Layin' at Your altar
