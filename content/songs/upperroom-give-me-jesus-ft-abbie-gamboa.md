I don't want anything but You
You're more than every dream come true
All of the things I thought I wanted don't come close to knowing You
Now that I'm Yours and You are mine
Our love is the secret that I find
I'll spend forever in the pleasure I've found looking in Your eyes

Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world
More than silver, more than gold
You are the treasure that I hold
Now that I've tastÐµd of Your goodness, nothing else will satisfy

Just givÐµ me Jesus
Give me Jesus
And you can have all this world
You can have all this world
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
And you can have all this world
You can have all this world

Just give me Jesus
I only want Jesus
I only want Jesus
I only want Jesus
[Bridge]
I don't want anyone else
I don't need anything else
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
I don't want anyone else
I don't need anything else
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
I don't want anyone else
I don't need anything else
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
I don't want anyone else
I don't need anything else
'Cause You are my one thing
You are my one thing
[Refrain]
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
You are my one thing

Just give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world
[Bridge]
Oh, and I don't want anyone else
And I don't need anything else
'Cause You are my one thing
You are my one thing
I don't want anyone else
And I don't need anything else
'Cause You are my one thing
You are my one thing
Oh, I don't want anyone else
And I don't need anything else
'Cause You are my one thing
You are my one thing
I don't want anyone else
And I don't need anything else
'Cause You are my one thing
You are my one thing
[Refrain]
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
Oh, You are my one thing
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
Oh, You are my one thing
You are my one thing
You are my one thing
Yeah, You are my one thing
You are my one thing
You are my one thing

Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
You can have all this world
