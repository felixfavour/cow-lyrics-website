[Pre-Chorus]
Lord let my life be an altar
Light up my lungs with your praise
Cause I can’t breathe
Until you Breathe
So breathe on me
Let my life be an altar
Lord let my life be an altar
Light up my lungs with your praise
Cause I can’t breathe
Until you breathe
So breathe on me
Let my life be an altar
This is a moment when wind meets fire
Come on in
Our hearts are burning for fresh revival
Blow again
This is a moment where wind meets fire
Comе on in
Our hearts are burning for fresh rеvival
Blow again
[Post-Chorus]
Our God is consuming fire
Our God is a Holy wind
Whatever You speak is done
Whatever You touch will live
Our God is consuming fire
Our God is a holy wind
Whatever You speak is done
Whatever You touch will live
