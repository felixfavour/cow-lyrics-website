Ayy
(I'll be afraid with you)
I can't stop your tears
But I'll lay beside you on the floor
And let mine fall into yours
I can't be your peace
But I'll stay right by you in the storm
I'll fight beside you in the war
I might not have all the words
Might not be able to fix all the hurt
Ooh, can't pretend to know what you're goin' through, yeah
But when the weight of the pain's too heavy
When you're lost and you're scared to death
I wanna feel it too
I'll be afraid with you
If your fear's got your heart surrounded
I'm right here, you can take my hand
I wanna feel it too
I'll be afraid with you, afraid with you
Ay-yeah, yÐµah, yeah
Ay-yeah, yeah, yÐµah
Ay-yeah, yeah, yeah (I'll be afraid with you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you let me in
I'll listen to the voices in your head
I'll meet you in the middle of your mess
I might not have all the words
Might not be able to fix all the hurt
Ooh, but thinkin' you're alone is a lie
'Cause when the weight of the pain's too heavy
When you're lost and you're scared to death
I wanna feel it too
I'll be afraid with you
If your fear's got your heart surrounded
I'm right here, you can take my hand
I wanna feel it too
I'll be afraid with you, afraid with you
Ay-yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay-yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay-yeah, yeah, yeah (I'll be afraid with you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come a little closer, come a little closer
You can let your secrets out
Come a little closer, come a little closer
You can let the walls come down
Come a little closer, come a little closer
You can be yourself right now
You can be yourself right now
Thinkin' you're alone is a lie (Woo)
When the weight of the pain's too heavy
When you're lost and you're scared to death
I wanna feel it too (Oh, I wanna feel it too)
I'll be afraid with you (I'll be afraid with you)
If your fear's got your heart surrounded
I'm right here, you can take my hand
I wanna feel it too (I wanna feel it too)
I'll be afraid with you, afraid with you
Ay-yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ay-yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Ay-yeah, yeah, yeah (I'll be afraid with you, ooh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay-yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Ay-yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh-ooh-ooh) (Ooh-ooh)
Ay-yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll be afraid with you, afraid with you
[Outro: Bishop T.D. Jakes]
So here are your takeaways
God is saying that if you are going to be like Him
You have to love like Him
You have to love people who don't think like you, who don't look like you, who don't vote like you, who don't dress like you
And you have to take down the tribunal whereby you try people before you love them
And begin to understand that love has no loopholes
Don't dress it up in political clothes
Don't dress it up in religious clothes
Don't dress it up in status, love has no loopholes
See, well, love will make you change your mind
Love'll make you go an extra mile
Love'll make you apologize, even though you thought you was right
Love'll make you feed somebody who cussed you out
Love'll make you call somebody, even though it makes you look like the weaker one
Does anybody understand the words that are comin' out of my mouth
