I have a home, eternal home
But for now, I walk this broken world
You walked it first, You know our pain
But You show hope can rise again
Up from the grave

Abide with me, abide with me
Don't let me fall and don't let go
Walk with me and never leave
Ever close, God, abide with me
There in the night, Gethsemane
Before the cross, before the nails
Overwhelmed, alone You prayed
You met us in our suffering
And bore our shame

Abide with me, abide with me
Don't let me fall and don't let go
Walk with me and never leave
Ever close, God, abide with me
[Bridge]
Oh love that will not ever let me go
Love that will not ever let me go
You never let me go
Love that will not ever let me go
For You'll never let us go
And up ahead, eternity
We'll weep no more, we'll sing for joy
Abide with me
