Did You rise the sun for me
Or paint a million stars that I might
Know Your majesty
Is Your voice upon the wind
Is everything I've known marked with my
Maker's fingerprints
[Pre-Chorus]
Breathe on me
Let me see Your face
Ever I will seek You
'Cause all You are is all I want always
Draw me close in Your arms oh God
I wanna be with You
Can I feel You in the rain
Abandon all I am to have You
Capture me again
Let the earth resound with praise
Can You hear as all creation lives to
Glorify one name
