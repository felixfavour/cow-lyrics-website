You put Your love on the line
To bear the weight of sin that was mine
Washing my river of wrongs
Into the sea of Your infinite love
With arms held high
Lord I give my life
Knowing I'm found in Christ
In Your love forever
With all I am
In your grace I stand
The greatest of all romance
Love of God my Savior
(Oh You're my Savior, Jesus)
Mercy roars like hurricane winds
Furious love laid waste to my sin
With arms held high
Lord I give my life
Knowing I'm found in Christ
In Your love forever
With all I am
In your grace I stand
The greatest of all romance
Love of God my Savior
(Oh your love Jesus)
