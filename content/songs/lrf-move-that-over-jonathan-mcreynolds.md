[Bridge: Jonathan McReynolds]
Mmm
My friends (move that over)
My family (You can move that over)
My relationships (You can move that over)
Whatever it is (You can move that over, too)
My Facebook time (You can move that over)
My Instagram time (You can move that over)
See, I will make room, yeah
See, whatever it is, God (You can move that over)
Whatever it is, Jesus (You can move that over, too)
If it's in Your way, God (You can move that over)
You need to move it over (You can move that over, too)
You need to move it over (You can move that over)
You need to move it over (You can move that over, too)
See, I will make room (turn up the life room, come on)
[Bridge: Travis Greene]
Whatever it is (You can move that over)
Move it over (You can move that over, too)
Jesus, move it over (You can move that over)
Move it over (You can move that over, too)
Everything, yeah (You can move that over)
Everything, Jesus (You can move that over, too)
I will make, make room for You
