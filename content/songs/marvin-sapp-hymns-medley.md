So since my mama here
I just wanna sing a couple songs
That I remember that she taught me
When I was a little bitty boy
One of 'em goes like this
Yield (Alright, yes, sir) not to temptation
For yielding is sin (Yes, sir)
Each victory will help you
Some others to win
Fight manfully onward
Dark passions subdue
Woah, look ever to Jesus (Yes)
And He will carry you through
You just ask the savior to help you
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you
He is willing to aid you
Oh, He will carry you through
Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
Your heart, does the spirit control?
You can only be blessed
And have peace and sweet rest
As you yield Him your body and soul
Let's go to the verse
You have longed for sweet peace (Yeah, yeah)
And for faith to increase
You have earnestly, fervently prayed
But you cannot have rest
Or be perfectly blessed
Until all on the altar is, is laid (Yes)
Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
Your heart, does the spirit control?
You can only, only be blessed
And have peace and sweet rest
As you yield Him (Our God) your body and soul
