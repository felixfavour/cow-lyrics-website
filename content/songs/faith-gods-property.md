Yo my brother, Myron
Myron, do you really have faith?
I got mustard seed faith
So you won't mind telling everybody
Check it out
I can do the impossible
I can see the invisible
Because I got fatih
('Cause I know I got faith yeah yeah)
I can climb a mountain
Said I can reach my goal
More than a conqueror
Down in my soul
The devil is a liar
I've won the race
Said I got victory
All because I got faith YEAH
I can do the impossible
I can see the invisible
Because I got faith
('Cause I know I got faith yeah yeah)
I can climb a mountain
Said I can reach my goal
More than a conqueror
Down in my soul
The devil is a liar
I've won the race
Said I got victory
All because I got faith YEAH
