We humbly bow
Before You now
We lift our lives up to You
On our knees we bring
Our humble offering
Of worship and honor and praise
[Chorus:]
Boldly we come to Your throne O Father
But only by grace can we come
We've been bought by the precious blood of the Lamb
We lay down our lives before You, Jesus
We willingly give You all
As humbly at Your feet we fall
For it's the highest place of all O Lord
On this Holy ground
Our hearts bow down
Your awesome splendor overwhelms
But there is no fear
For Jesus You are here
Your shed blood has made us a way (a way)
[Repeat Chorus:]
