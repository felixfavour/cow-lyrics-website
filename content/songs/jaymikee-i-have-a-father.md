I've been called many titles
A wretched boy, a sinner,
a little orphan
I have journeyed in circle, like a little piece of
nothing in a deep ocean.
 Until I discovered the power of love,
The lord of creation adopted me,  He gave me a new hope,
A reason to believe,
Now on the edge of glory
 I'm proud to say
I have a father, almighty father, He never slumbers,
Jehovah shama
 Eyin sha lawi maye un,
Eyin sha leleburu
ike,
O se mi lanu, Emi na-an re, baba o Baba ara to mo yi omo
 Many times I'm unworthy
 To look upon the greater view of you
But compassion and mercy is all I see Hold my hand and call me your
own
 You said I'm created in the image of you
 If you are not in me
then what can I do,
 Only your power and wisdom can carry me through,
So until the end, I'll keep on calling baba mi o
Bridge: Omo Omo, omo, omo...
Eyin lasheda ameda aweda o Ogbe ogo kari ogo o o o (
Alade o maa wo le) (
Baba ton dabo mi Baba ton toju mi)
