No time to be worried about
So called friends who's not around
No time to be worried about
Gossipers that pull you down
No time to be worried about
The whose the who's and what they do
No time to be worried about
Finding things you know the truth
There's no time to waste
Get your business straight
You gotta be ready ready ready when He comes
Be ready ready ready when He comes
There's no time no time to waste
No time to be worried about
So called friends who's not around
No time to be worried about
Gossipers that pull you down
No time to be worried about
The whose the who's and what they do
No time to be worried about
Finding things you know the truth
There's no time to waste
Get your business straight
You gotta be ready ready ready when He comes
Be ready ready ready when He comes
You gotta be ready ready ready when He comes
Be ready ready ready when He comes
You gotta be ready ready ready when He comes
Be ready ready ready when He comes
There's no time no time to waste
