Woke up to a world that is changing
Looking out the window, got me wondering lately
Will we be okay?
Will we be okay? (Huh, yes)
One day I can feel the sun shining
Next day a bullet can leave a momma cryin'
Will she be okay? (Lord have mercy)
Tell me will we be okay?
[Pre-Chorus]
(Truth is)
Life is taking everything that I have
Just to survive (Can I testify?)

I got twenty-five dollars in my pocket
And I think another ten in my glove compartment
I'm trying so bad not to cry, but it's hard to stop it
But you say all of my needs, you promised, you got it
[Refrain]
So I'm gon' be okay (Hahaha, yes)
I'm gon' be okay (Sing) (Okay, okay)
See I gotta remember, that my God is bigger
Than any battle I'll ever face
So I'm gon' be okay
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, it's dark right now
But I still see the light
Come on!
Why do we hate one another (Yeah)
When love is the most beautiful color?
It takes away the grey (I hope somebody's listening)
And makes everything okay (Huh, my Lord)
Where is the American dream
If only one percent knows what it means
To really be okay? (Are y'all listening)
Tell me, is that okay? (Huh, say it again)
[Pre-Chorus]
Life is taking everything that I have
Just to survive (Well, lemme talk to ya)

I got twenty-five dollars in my pocket
And I think another ten in my glove compartment (Ayy)
I'm trying so bad not to cry, but it's hard to stop it (But you say)
But you say all of my needs, you promised, you got it (Help me)
[Refrain]
So I'm gon' be okay (Even in the midst of trouble, say)
I'm gon' be okay (Sing) (Okay, okay)
See I gotta remember, that my God is bigger (My God is bigger)
Than any battle I'll ever face
So I'm gon' be okay
[Bridge]
(Say)
See our god is great
This season of pain, it won't last always (Hallelujah)
Life is taking everything that I have
Just to survive (Open up your eyes y'all)
You got twenty-five dollars in your pocket
And you think another ten in your glove compartment
But that family with no food would trade places with you
Give thanks and don't forget how you got it
[Refrain]
And we gon' be okay (Yeah, huh, can I get a witness?)
We gon' be okay (Sing) (Okay, okay)
('Cause I gotta remember)
See I gotta remember (No matter what i go through)
That my god is bigger (My God is bigger)
Than any battle I'll ever face (Come on)
So I'm gon' be okay
(If one door closes, God's got another)
We gon' be okay
(And your doctor's not the final answer y'all, hey)
And you gon' be okay
(You needed this storm to wake you up and make you better)
I'm gon' be okay (Now sing) (Okay, okay)
So I'm gon' be okay
