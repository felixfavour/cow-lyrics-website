You could have stepped into creation
With fire for all to see
Brought every tribe and nation to their knees
Arriving with the host of Heaven
In royal robe and crown
The rulers of the earth all bowing down
But You chose meekness over majesty
Wrapped Your power in humanity
Glory be to You alone
King who reigns from a manger throne
My life, my praise, everything I own
To Jesus the King on a manger throne
You could have marched in all Your glory
Into the heart of Rome
Showed thеm splendor like they'd nеver known
But You wrote a better story
In humble Bethlehem
Creator in the arms of common men
You died for our redemption
And You rise so we can live
