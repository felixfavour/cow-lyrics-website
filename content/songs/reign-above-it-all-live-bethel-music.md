The reign of darkness now has ended
In the kingdom of light
In the kingdom of light
Forever under Your dominion
You're the King of my life
You're the King of my life
You reign above it all, You reign above it all
Over the universe and over every heart
There is no higher name
Jesus, You reign above it all
On the cross, the work was finished
God, You poured out Your life
Just to give us new life
Now from the lips of the forgiven
Hear an anthem arise
'Cause, Jesus, You're alive, oh
You reign above it all, You reign above it all
Over the universe and over every heart
There is no higher name
Jesus, You reign above it all
Let all of Heaven and the Earth erupt in song
Sing Hallelujah to the Everlasting One
There is no higher name
Jesus, You reign above it all
Yes, You reign above it all
