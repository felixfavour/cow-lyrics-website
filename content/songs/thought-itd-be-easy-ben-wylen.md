I was just gazing
Over my shoulder
Your hand touching mine
You were just standing
Painting a picture
At me with your eyes
So it’s all the stranger
To watch as you watch me
Waving goodbye
I thought it’d be easy
To finally leave you behind
I thought it’d be easy
But it only feels like dying
(Ooh)
(Ooh alright)
I was just driving
I glance in the mirror
And you’re in the backseat
