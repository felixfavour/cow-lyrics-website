Maybe the streets are gold
And there's a table with plenty room
Maybe we don't grow old
And we got nothing to lose
Maybe in the Promise Land
There's a choir when you walk through
Oh, but I pray Heaven is like rain on a tin roof
Maybe the sun don't set
And the waters don't rise
Maybe we don't forget
How to laugh like a child
Maybe in the Promise Land
We're all made for what we do
Oh, but I pray Heaven is like rain on a tin roof
Washing away
Washing away my sorrows
Giving me faith
Giving me faith to follow a new tomorrow
They tell me in the Promise Land
There are mansions to choose
Oh, but I pray Heaven is like rain on a tin roof
