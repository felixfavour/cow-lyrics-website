I walk into your gates, I know I am welcome
I step into your peace, I know I am loved
I walk into your gates, I know I am welcome
I step into your grace, I know I am loved
It is new every morning, new every morning, I come
Your mercy is new every morning, new every morning, I come
 I come
I come in by your grace, I know I am welcome
I come in by your grace, I know I am loved
I am loved by you
It is new every morning, so I come afresh
It is new every morning, so I come afresh
Your mercy is new every morning, new every morning, I come
Your mercy is new every morning, new every morning, I come
I've come to receive from you
I've come to receive help from you
Your mercy is new this morning, so I come afresh.
New this morning
Holy father we come
We come we come
We come running
Daddy to receive
We come running
