What an Honor to be invited
To the Marriage of the Lamb,
To come and Worship Him
Celebration it's the joining
Of the Bride and the Son,
The two becoming One
All the Prophecies Fulfilled
In a Moment so we Sing
Like the Roar of many Waters
Like the Sound of Rolling Thunder
Hallelujah, give him Glory
For the Marriage of the Lamb is coming
We're getting ready
Filled with Wonder,
As we behold the Man
With Fire in his Eyes,
The very Word of God
You are Worthy Every Kingdom,
Every Nation bowing down
We'll Crown you with many Crowns
Every Creed and Tribe
And Tongue declaring
In Unity
Like the Roar of many Waters
Like the Sound of Rolling Thunder
Hallelujah, give him Glory
For the Marriage of the Lamb is coming
Hallelujah, give him Glory
For the Marriage of the Lamb is coming
We're getting ready
