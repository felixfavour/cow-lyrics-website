Eeeeh
Eeeeeh
Can we go?
When trouble says that I need more time to heal
But His hands have touched me
Though trouble says that I need more time to heal
But it's His hands that touched me
I have been transformed
I have been transformed
I have been transformed
I have been transformed
For His hands have touched me
Better than time, He's healed my wounds
I have been transformed
Better than time, He's healed my wounds
I have been restored
You restored me
Your healing hands restored me
I have been transformed
I have been transformed
I have been transformed
I have been transformed
For His hands have touched me
I have been transformed
I have been transformed
I have been transformed
I have been transformed
For His hands have touched me
Better than time, He healed my wounds
I have been transformed
Better than time, He's healed my wounds
I have been restored.
