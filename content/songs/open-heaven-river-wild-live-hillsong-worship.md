Signs and wonders from above
When You poured out Your Spirit
On the old and the young
In the power of Your presence
Holy Spirit, rain, falling like a flood
Break upon my praise as I sing of Your love
Holy Spirit, fire, burn within my soul
As I call on Your Name
As I call on Your Name
Jesus
Dreams and visions of the Son
As I stand in Your presence
Revelations of Your love
As I look to the heavens
Holy Spirit, rain, falling like a flood
Break upon my praise as I sing of Your love
Holy Spirit, fire, burn within my soul
As I call on Your Name
As I call on Your Name
