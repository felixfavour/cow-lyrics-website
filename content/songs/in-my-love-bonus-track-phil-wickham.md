I have looked you in the eyes
I have seen the tears you cried
I have heard you question why you are here
There is a reason, there's a plan
There is a God who understands
He's got your life inside His hands, have no fear
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause He says
"In all your hurt, in all your pain
I'll never leave, I won't forsake
You're my child and I'm Your God
Come and rest in my love"I know this road is steep
And I know you're tired and weak
But the God of perfect peace is right here
He is the shelter from the storm
He is a rock, firm and secure
He is hope forever more, have no fear
