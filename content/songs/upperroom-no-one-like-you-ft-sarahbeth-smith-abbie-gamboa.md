No One Like You (Spontaneous) Lyrics

Who is like You?
No one that I know
I could search all the earth and find no one
There's no shadow that You won't be found in
Your face illuminates the deep in me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
No one like You
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Faithful and true
No one like You

All creation flickering Your beauty
Every starlight responding to Your name
All of heaven caught up in Your glory
Jesus Christ, our humble wounded King

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
No one like You
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Faithful and true
No one like You

[Bridge]
I could search all of heaven above
And never find another like You, another like You
I could search all the earth below
And never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more beautiful
Never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more wonderful
Never find another like You, another like You
I could search all of heaven above
And never find another like You, another like You
I could search all the earth below
And never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more beautiful
Never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more wonderful
Never find another like You, another like You
Who is like the Lord?
Who is like the Lord?
Who is like the Lord?
Who is like the Lord?
Whoa, no one like You
Whoa
Whoa, faithful and true
No one like You
Whoa, no one like You
Whoa
Whoa, faithful and true
No one like You
I could search all of heaven above
And never find another like You, another like You
I could search all the earth below
And never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more beautiful
Never find another like You, another like You
There's no other more wonderful
Never find another like You, another like You
Who is like the Lord?
Who is like the Lord?
Who is like the Lord?
Who is like the Lord?
