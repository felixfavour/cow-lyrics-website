I surrender all to You my God
I will give You all I have
For You took my filthiness
And made me clean
I love You, Lord
Your praises I will sing
Let Heaven shout
For I have been redeemed
I lay down my life
My plans, my rights
For I'm captured by Your love
And though I lose this world, I will know You
I love You, Lord
Your praises I will sing (I will sing)
Let Heaven shout
For I have been redeemed
[Bridge]
Oh God
Nothing compares
To who You are God, no
And nothing compares
Oh, I know that
Nothing compares, to You
I've tasted and I've seen, I know that
Nothing compares!
Sing it out
