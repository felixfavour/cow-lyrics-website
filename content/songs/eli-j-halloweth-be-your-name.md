With open hands we say
Hallowed be Your Name
Whatever comes our way
Hallowed be Your Name
The One who is to come (we lift our voices and say)
Hallowed be Your Name
(O Lord) The Beginning and the End (we lift our voices and say)
Hallowed be Your Name
Oh

You've never failed me
You are just the same (the same)
Yesterday, today (today)
Look at me, look at me
The one You saved
Hallowed be Your Name
