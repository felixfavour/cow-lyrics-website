Jesus your love is amazing
I see your grace all around me
And everywhere I turn I see favour
What would I do without You?
Jesus your love is amazing
I see your grace all around me
And everywhere I turn I see favour
What would I do without You?
Brand new mercies (everyday)
Signs and wonders (daily basis)
And even when I don't deserve it
Show me favour anyway
Brand new mercies (everyday)
Signs and wonders (daily basis)
And even when I don't deserve it
Show me favour anyway
You turn my mourning to dancing
You showered me with blessings
Now I see my cup overflowing
I'll tell the world what you've done
Brand new mercies (every day)
Signs and wonders (daily basis)
And even when I don't deserve it
Show me favour anyway
Brand new mercies (every day)
Signs and wonders (daily basis)
And even when I don't deserve it
Show me favour anyway
Your love is unconditional
Jesus the love you've shown me,
Lord has turned my life around
Your love is unconditional
Jesus the love you've shown me,
Lord has turned my life around
Your love is unconditional
Jesus the love you've shown me,
Lord has turned my life around
Your love is unconditional
Jesus the love you've shown me,
Lord has turned my life around
(Eh yah, eh yah eh)
Eh yah eh
I love the way you love me
Eh yah eh
Eh yah eh
I love the way you love me
