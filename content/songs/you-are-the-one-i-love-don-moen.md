Nobody else could change my heart
Nobody else could save me
Picked up the pieces when I fell apart
I'm so glad you're unchanging
Yes You are the one that I love
Light of the world descend from above
Sing hallelujah
Shout to the Lord
You are the one
You are the one
I love
If i knew this song that the angels sang
We will be singing together
Cuz I can't wait for eternity
Praising Your name forever
