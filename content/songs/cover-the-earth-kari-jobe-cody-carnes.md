I've seen it before
Felt it before
Peace I canâ€™t explain
Love that won the war
Is here now
Can you feel it now?
Let it cover you
[Chorus: Kari Jobe & Cody Carnes]
Let the Spirit rise up, let it break through the walls
And beat down the doors, and crash through the windows
And cover the earth, the earth, the earth, the earth
Let the Spirit rise up, let it break through the walls
And beat down the doors, and crash through the windows
And cover the earth, the earth, the earth, the earth
The earth, the earth, the earth
Bricks won't hold it in
Lies won't hold it down
Love will let it out
And we will let it drown
The darkness, the fears and brokenness
Can you feel it now?
Let it cover you
