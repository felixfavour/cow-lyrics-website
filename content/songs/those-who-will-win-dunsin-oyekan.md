This is the place of his power
This is the place of his grace
At the feet of my Jesus
It's the highest place
This is the place of his power
This is the place of his grace
At the feet of my Jesus
It's the highest place
As we bow before him
We find Grace and mercy to help
Victory's assured at the place of His feet
Those who will win
Must know how to bow before Him
Those who will win
Must know how to bow before Him
Those who will win
Must know how to bow before Him
Those who will win
Must know how to bow bеfore Him
This is the place of his powеr
This is the place of his grace
At the feet of my Jesus
It's a highest place
This is the place of his power
This is the place of his grace
At the feet of my Jesus
It's the highest place
As we bow before him
We find Grace and mercy to help
Victory's assured at the place of His feet
Those who will win
Must know how to bow before Him
Those who will win
Must know how to bow before Him
Those who will win
Must know how to bow before Him
Those who will win
Must know how to bow before Him
As we bow before him
We find Grace and mercy to help
Victory's assured at the place of His feet
Those who will win
Must know how to bow before Him
Those who will win
Must know how to bow before Him
Those who will win
Must know how to dance before Him
Those who will win
Must know how to dance before Him
Somebody dance before your maker
Father we dance before you
We give you all the glory
This is how I fight my battle
This is how I fight my battle

They Must know how to go bend their knees before Him

Elisha said, "Before God, whom I stand
This is a simple matter
Must know how to bow before Him
Because as I bow
I receive strategies before him
Must know how to bow before Him
In the days coming
You must know how to bow before him
Must know how to bow before Him
Because the labor of fools weary them
For they do not know how to enter the city
Must know how to bow before Him
You must know how to bow
This is your place of power
Must know how to bow before Him
As I bow before Him
I receive all I need for life and destiny
Must know how to bow before Him
I must learn how to bow before Him
Must know how to bow before Him
I must enjoy how to bow before Him
Must know how to bow before Him
As we bow before him
We find Grace and mercy to help
Victory's assured at the place of His feet
Those who will win
They must know how to bow before Him
Before him
Before him
