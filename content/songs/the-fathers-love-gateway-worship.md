No greater love have we known
We sing, we sing
The depth of the grace You have shown
We sing, we sing
Sing Forever
Forever we live to proclaim
CHORUS
We found love
In the arms of the Savior
Hope has come
Death has been defeated
We are one
And nothing can separate us
From the Father’s love
(C'mon, declare this tonight, let's sing)
You dwell inside of our praise
We sing, we sing
To tell of Your life and Your name
We sing, we sing
Forever we live to proclaim
CHORUS
We found love
In the arms of the Savior
Hope has come
Death has been defeated
We are one
And nothing can separate us
From the Father’s love
