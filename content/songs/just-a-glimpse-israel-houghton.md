I don't have to fully know
Just how far Your love can go
To sing of Your love for me
I don't have to comprehend
How Your mercy never ends
To sing of Your mercy
And all I need is
All I really need is
Just a glimpse of You
And I'm in awe
Just a glimpse of You
My God
Just a glimpse of You
And all I can do is worship
All I can do is worship You Lord, yeah
And I don't have to clearly see
How amazing grace can be
To sing of Your grace for me
And I don't have to fully grasp
The measure of Your holiness
Oh, to sing holy holy, holy holy
