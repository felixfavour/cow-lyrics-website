Look across the world
And let us shine for you, Lord
The whole world is yours
And I want to live for you
One thing I know
Is that you've changed my life
I give you my all
All you are is good
Give you my heart
God it's only you I seek
Give you my praise
'Cause I believe in you
Look across the world
And let us shine for you, Lord
The whole world is yours
And I want to live for you, O God
All that I know
Is that you've changed my life
I give you my all
And all you are is good
Carry the lost
Make my prayer in this life real
Carry my cross
Hold on 'til I see you
