Here I am down on my knees again
Surrendering all, surrendering all

Find me here, Lord as You draw me near
Desperate for You, desperate for You
I surrender

Drench my soul 
as mercy and grace unfold
I hunger and thirst, I hunger and thirst

With arms stretched wide
I know You hear my cry
Speak to me now, Speak to me now

I surrender, I surrender
I want to know You more
I want to know You more
(repeat)

Like a rushing wind, Jesus breathe within
Lord have Your way, 
Lord have Your way in me

Like a mighty storm, stir within my soul
Lord have Your way, 
Lord have Your way in me

Like a rushing wind, Jesus breathe within
Lord have Your way, 
Lord have Your way in me

Like a mighty storm, stir within my soul
Lord have Your way, 
Lord have Your way in me

I surrender, I surrender
I want to know You more
I want to know You more
(repeat)
