Arise my soul
Remember this
He took my sin
And He buried it
No longer I who live
Now Jesus lives in me
For I was dead in sin
But I woke up to see the light
[Instrumental]
No I won't boast
But in the cross
That saved my soul
All else is loss
The grip of fear
Has no hold on me
So where o death
Where is your sting
