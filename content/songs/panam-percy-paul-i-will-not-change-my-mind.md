th this kind of experience of His presence
Tell me how can I ever change my mind
From following Him
No my mind is made up
You know it's like
It's actually like getting married
It is getting married
You know when we stand out here to accept the Lord Jesus Christ
Sometimes I wish we could change the words
And say
I take You Jesus
To be my lawful wedded husband
To have and to hold
To love and to cherish
Forsaking all others clinging only to You
And I love You with all my worldly possession
For better for worse
Until death brings us together
If I have to start again
To grow rich in this world
At the expense of my soul
I will not change my mind
From following You
If I have to start again
To enjoy all the pleasures worldly given
Or to have the favor You gave
I will not change my mind
From following You
(My mind)
My mind is made up
My heart has decided
I've lifted my hands
To swear allegiance to You
My mind is made up
My heart has decided
I've lifted my hands
To swear allegiance to You
Oh God You are my Righteousness
Oh God in You alone I trust
Oh God if I live or I die
I will not change my mind
From following You
I will not change my mind
From following You
If I have to start again
To grow rich in this world
At the expense of my soul
I will not change my mind
From following You
If I have to start again
To have all that this world can give
Or to have the favor You gave
I will not change my mind
From following You
(My mind)
My mind is made up
My heart has decided
I've lifted my hands
To swear allegiance to You
My mind is made up
My heart has decided
I've lifted my hands
To swear allegiance to You
Oh God You are my Righteousness
Oh God in You alone I trust
Oh God if I live or I die
I will not change my mind
From following You
I will not change my mind
From following You
I will not change my mind
From following You
I will not change my mind
From following You
