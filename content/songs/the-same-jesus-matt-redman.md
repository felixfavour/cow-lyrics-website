[Intro]
Whoa, whoa
This Jesus
Who carried our shame
This Jesus
Who rose from the grave
The same Jesus
We worship today, we worship today
He came to us
In grace and in truth
He's still with us
And still on the move
The same Jesus
He is making us new, He is making us new
I know that my Redeemer lives
I know that my Redeemer lives
He's still keeping all His promises
The same Jesus, the same Jesus
Whoa, whoa
