I have a source of strength when I am weak. That takes me through when life is pressing me. I have a source of power from above. I'm covered over by a shield of love.

I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calvary. Those precious bloodstains were made there just for me. For all my sin, my sickness and my pain, when I need healing, I claim those precious bloodstains. 

I do not know how others make it through, who never go to Calvary as I do. For there the healing cleansing stream still flows. With peach that only His redeemed can know. 

I claim the blood Jesus shed on Calvary. Those precious bloodstains were made there just for me. For all my sin, my sickness and my pain, when I need healing, I claim those precious bloodstains. 

When I need healing, I claim those precious bloodstains.
