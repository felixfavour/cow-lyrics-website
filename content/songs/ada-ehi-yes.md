yes
Whatever I want
Whatever I need
Whatever I call
His answer is yes
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
The answer is yes
Again and again
I'll say it again
Again and again
The answer is yes
The walls are tumbling down
Around you
And doors are opening wide for you
You might have said before
Will it ever be
Jehovah says to you
Uuhum
What ever it is rise again
Forever a dream you shine again
For every seed you rot again
For every prayer the answer is yes
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
The answer is yes
Again and again
I'll say it again
Again and again
The answer is yes
Don't give up now
Its only for a while
This walls that you see
Get to them
They are not real
Remember
Your answer is... yes
Your answer is... yes
Close your eyes... yes
Keeping saying it... yes
My answer is... yes
Keeping talking... yes
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
The answer is yes
Again and again
I'll say it again
Again and again
The answer is yes
Again and again
Again and again
Again and again
The answer is yes
Again and again
I'll say it again
Again and again
The answer is yes
the answer is yes (till fade)
