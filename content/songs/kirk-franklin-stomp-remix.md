Lately, I've been going through some things that's really got me down
I need someone, somebody, to help me come and turn my life around
I can't explain it
I can't obtain it
Jesus, your love is so, it's so amazing
It gets me high, up to the sky
And when I think about your goodness, it makes me want to
Stomp
Makes me clap my hands, makes me want to dance and
Stomp
My brother, can't you see? I got the victory
Stomp
When I think about the goodness and the fullness of god
Make me thankful, pity to be hateful than grateful
The lord brought me through this far
Tryin' to be cute when I praise him
Raise'em high, I keep it live, beat bumpin'
Keep ya' jumpin', make the lord feel somethin'
Ain't no shame in my game, god's property
Came to get wit' kirk, ain't no stoppin' me,
Now stomp
"G.P. Are you with me?"
"Oh yeah, we having church, we ain't going nowhere"
I promise the stomp, the whole stomp, nothing but the stomp
It ain't over, it ain't over!
Stomp
