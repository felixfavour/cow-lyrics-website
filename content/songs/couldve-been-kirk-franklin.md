It could've been me
With no clothes, no shoes and no food to eat
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
It could've been me
Without you love Lord tell me where would I be
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah)
It could've been
Me in the cold with
(Everything gone)
No house no job
(Outside all alone)
Sitting trying to figure out
(Where I went wrong)
Can somebody help me
(Tell me what do I do)
Can't feed my kids need
(Money for the rent)
Bills after bills but
(Everything spent)
The enemy telling me you
(Might as well quit)
With tears in my eyes crying
(Lord please get me through)
See that's the reason
(I just can't thank you enough no matter how hard I try, Jesus, I realize)
