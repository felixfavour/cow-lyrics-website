[Instrumental]
Just as sure as the sun
Sets at the end of the day
Then the darkness fades
And the clouds, they roll away
Just as sure as the hands
On the clock keep ticking away the time
And trouble on my mind
Makes it hard for joy to find
[Pre-Chorus 1: Tori Kelly]
Just as sure as winter fades
And then it turns to spring
I believe deliverance, will surely come for me
Just as sure as my heart
Will someday be made anew
I know You love me
Just as I do love You
Mmm, just as I do love You
Just as sure as the test
Is there to make me perfect in Your eyes
It may hurt for a while
But by faith I shall survive
Just as sure as the rain
Falls on me only to make me grow
No matter how I feel
Now I live by what I know
