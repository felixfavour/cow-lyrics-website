[Tasha Cobbs]
I have decided to follow Jesus
Wooh!
I have decided to follow Jesus
(Help me sing that Bre)
[Tasha Cobbs and Breona Lawrence]
I have decided to follow Jesus
Yeah
I have decided to follow Jesus
[Tasha Cobbs]
Give me one pure and holy passion
Give me one magnificent obsession
Give me one glorious ambition for my life
To know and follow hard after you
Give me one pure and holy passion
Give me one magnificent obsession
Give me one glorious ambition for my life, Lord
To know and follow hard after you (hard after you)
(Oh, I wanna follow you)
[Breona Lawrence]
Oh to know and follow hard after you
(To know and follow hard after you - Tasha Cobbs)
To go as your disciple in your truth
(To go as your disciple)
This world is empty, pale and dull
Compared to knowing you my Lord
Lead me on and I will run after you
Lead me on and I will run after you
(Ooooh)
