I gat a buddy of mine that's here from jamaica Dj nicholas
You never gave up on me
Open my eyes so that i could see
Gave me a reason to dance, a reason to sing
Your Love gave me victory
You are the reason i smile(the reason why i smile)
When everything could be up side down And by your power i'm redeemed oh God And by your Love am being set free Everything is better, everything is greater with you that's why i can't seem to keep my hands down oh my God I can see it all clearly all i ever needed is you
I said i can't seem to Keep my hands down o
Jesus you are the reason
That i lift my hands today
Lift My hands today Oh Jesus you are the reason That i lift my hands today Lift my hands today
I gotta let the world know The only one who can make me whole Has the greatest name No other can loose my chains That's why i Love him so Why i Love him so Changed everything For the rest of my life i'll sing Oh yeah oh oh oh oh oh You make all things better You make all things better I can see it all clearly All i ever needed is you That's why i can't seem to Keep my hands down oh ai Jesus you are the reason That i lift my hands today Lift my hands today Oh Jesus you are the reason That i lift my hands today Lift my hands today (Rap) Oh my God Oh my King You are the reason why i keep my hands high Oh my God oh my king You are the reason why i Keep my hands high You are the reason that i Keep my hands high You are the reason that i Keep my hands high Jehovah Jireh My provider Jehovah Nissi Jehovah Rapha The great healer Mighty warrior You are great oh yes Lord Oh oh oh oh no Ohh yeahhhh
