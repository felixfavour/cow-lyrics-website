[Chorus]
I'm in love, love with you
Like i never dreamed
I'm in love, love with you
And i'm flying free
I feel like singing now
My heart is free
You've forgiven me
Your name's the sweetest sound to my ears
Lord hold me near
I'm in love, love with you
Like i never dreamed
I'm in love, love with you
And i'm flying free
From the things that tie me down
I'm walking on the ground
I'm in love, love with you
You're all i think about
Day and night all the time
How you make my world
Go 'round and make it stop
You're all i got
