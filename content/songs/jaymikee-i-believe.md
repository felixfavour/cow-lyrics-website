Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I still believe, yes I believe
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Of course I believe, yes I believe
Have you thought about faith when you are walking alone?
Have you thought about trusting in the promises you have been given?
Uhn uhn yeah
It may be tough but God is still on the throne
Oh yes He is
I may not see him but I see the proof and believe Him
So, I will keep my head high
I don't know what the future holds
But I know who holds my future
No matter what is on the road
I still believe, yes I believe
God knows what I'm created for
He gave me a dream and a vision
So I will never let Him go
'Cause I believe, yes I believe
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I still believe, yes I believe
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
'Cause I believe, yes I believe
Do you still believe when things are not going your way?
Have you thought about holding on to when your prayers have not been answered?
I may be down but I'm still thankful for each day
Because all the shadows and chaos can never overshadow His will, His word
So, I will keep my head high
I don't know what the future holds
But I know who holds my future
No matter what is on the road
I still believe, yes I believe
God knows what I'm created for
He gave me a dream and a vision
So I will never let Him go
'Cause I believe, yes I believe
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I still believe, yes I believe
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
'Cause I believe, yes I believe
I will trust in the name of the Lord Most High
For He says all I need He will supply
For the rest of my life I will testify
Of the name of the Lord that justifies
I don't know what the future holds
But I know who holds my future
No matter what is on the road
I still believe, yes I believe
God knows what I'm created for
He gave me a dream and a vision
So I will never let Him go
'Cause I believe, yes I believe
