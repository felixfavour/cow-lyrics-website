Sanctify my heart
Lord of my life
Lord of my life
Purify my love
Lord of my life
Lord of my life
And I will hide myself
In Your righteousness
Chorus 1:
I will stand before You now
You have clothed me with Your power
You have sanctified my heart
Lord of my life
Sanctify my heart
Lord of my life
Lord of my life
Purify my love
Lord of my life
Lord of my life
And I will worship You
In Your holiness
