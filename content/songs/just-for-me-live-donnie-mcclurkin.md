What does the cross of Jesus mean?
It's more than songs we sing
Much more than the emblem on your chain
But it means I am free
From the chains of slavery
And the blood he shed won't let my sins remain
Upon the cross my savior died
The lamb was crucified
Showed us love that this world has never known
Oh what love divine
Truer love you'll never find
O that we might live
Love came and died alone
For the cross will always represent the love god has for me
When the lord of glory heaven-sent gave all on calvary
(he did it) just for me, just for me
Jesus came and did it just for me
Just for me, just for me
Jesus came and did it just for me
Just for me, just for me
Jesus came and did it just for me
