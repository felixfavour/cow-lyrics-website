With You, a thousand years are like a day
You're the Everlasting God
And I will trust You all the way
For You, a thousand songs are not enough
To thank You for Your love
You will always have my praise
For a thousand years and more
For a thousand years and more
You were there before the stars
You'll be there after they fade
Nothing changes who You are
You stay the same
God, Your love will never fail
And Your promise never breaks
You are always who You are
You never change
With You, a thousand years are like a day
You're the Everlasting God
And I will trust You all the way
For You, a thousand songs are not enough
To thank You for Your love
You will always have my praise
For a thousand years and more
For a thousand years and more
