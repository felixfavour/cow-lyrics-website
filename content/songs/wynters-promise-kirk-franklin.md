Just let heaven be real
'Cause there are wounds deep inside Earth cannot heal
So many things we take to disguise how we feel
It's cool, but it just won't do
When you know something greater is waiting on you
Just let heaven be home
When everything around you reminds you you don't belong
Science and reason telling me that I am wrong
"Don't believe in what you can't see"I see the unseen, I know there's something greater for me
My life, my life, my life, my life
Is sealed 'til the day the clouds roll away
Your life, your life, your life, your life
Was hopeless and lost but love paid the cost
Who thinks creation's wrong
You crucified your own
Until the day when we're finally healed
Just let heaven be real
Just let heaven be real
Just let heaven be true
If this all that's left, please tell me what do we do?
The hurting, the hopeless, they're all depending on you
Rescue me from this pain I see
We're crying freedom, nobody wants to be free
