Holy, holy, holy
Our God is on the throne
So firm is His foundation
No power can overthrow
And He shall reign forever and ever
One name, one name outlasts the ages
Through time His truth revealed
While kings may pass like shadows
Our God is sovereign still
And He shall reign forever and ever (Jesus)
And He shall reign forever and ever (He shall reign)
And He shall reign forever and ever (Oh, Jesus)
And He shall reign forever and ever
[Post-Chorus]
He shall reign
Well, c'mon, start to use your voice
Lift up his praise
He'll reign
Have this power, Jesus
Brings all to love
