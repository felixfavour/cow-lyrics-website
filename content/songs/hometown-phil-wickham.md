I can see You in the morning
I can see You in the stars at night
Everywhere
From the little miracles to the big, beautiful and bright
Everything around me
Carryin' Your fingerprints
Oh, what an artist
And You bring color to my life
Like a California sky
You amaze me over and over and over
Even after all this time
You still catch me by surprise
You amaze me over and over and over
Look at what You did inside me
I was lost with a broken heart
But that all changed
Somehow in Your hands, all my ashes turned to art
Now I live for Your glory
And oh, I was made for this
Oh, what an artist, yeah, yeah
