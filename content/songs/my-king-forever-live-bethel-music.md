You gave Your life for mine
Nailed to the cross
You crucified all my sin and shame
It was washed by Your mercy
You are the treasure I find
My reason for living
So let my life become an offering
To the One who is worthy
All praise to the Lord most high
All praise to the One who saved my life
All praise to Jesus Christ
High King of Heaven
My King forever
You stormed the gates of my heart
The veil in between was torn apart
Now You hold the keys to the grave
‘Cause You bring things to life
You roll stones away
