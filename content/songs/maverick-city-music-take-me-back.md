I remember when I was young
And Your voice, shouting loud my name
And since that moment
I haven't heard it quite that way
Well, now that I'm older
Could You say it again?
I remember I was afraid
And, oh, the hand I felt lead the way
And for the first time in my life I felt safe
Well, God, now that I'm older
Would You lead me again?

Oh, when the storm's out on the ocean
And the violent wind get's to blowing
Oh, take me back, back
All the way back
Oh, take me back to my first love
I remember when I was blind
And then Your love opened up my eyes
And oh, the light that flooded with Your light
Now that I'm older
Could You show me again?
Oh, would You show me again?

'Cause when the storm's out on the ocean
And the violent wind get's to blowing
Oh, take me back, back
All the way back
Oh, take me back to my first love

'Cause You are real to me
I have known it from the start
And there's no space between
The heavens and my heart
You are near to me
I've never been too far, hey
And in the in-between
You brought heaven to my heart, yeah

'Cause when the storm's out on the ocean
And the violent wind get's to blowing
Oh, take me back, back (Take me back, take me back)
All the way back (Hey)
Oh, take me back, back (Take me back, take me back)
All the way back (Hey)
Oh, take me back, back (I wanna go, I wanna go)
All the way back
Oh, take me back to my first love

When it was all simple
And loving was easy
When it was all simple
And trusting was easy
When it was all simple
(And loving) And loving was easy
When it was all simple
And trusting was easy
When it was all simple
And loving was easy
When it was all simple
And trusting was easy
When it was all simple
And loving was easy
When it was all simple
And trusting was easy
When it was all simple
And loving was easy
(When it was all) When it was all simple
And trusting was easy
[Spontaneous]
Take me back to the start, God
Where You won my heart
How could I ever forget?
Hey, no, I will never forget
No, I will never forget
The night You saved me (I will never forget)
The night You healed me (I will never forget)
The night You freed me (I will never forget)
From all of my chains (I will never forget)
The night that You freed me (I will never forget)
From all of my chains (I will never forget)
The night that You freed me (I will never forget)
From all of my chains (I will never forget)
And I will never be the same (I will never forget)
I will never be the same (I will never forget)
I will never forget (I will never forget)
Never (I will never forget)
Never (I will never forget)
Never (I will never forget)
You've been too good (I will never forget)
I will never forget (I will never forget)
Never (I will never forget)

'Cause when the storm's out on the ocean
And the violent wind get's to blowing
Oh, take me back, back
All the way back (Come on, sing it out)
Oh, take me back (Back), back (Back)
All the way back
Oh, take me back, back (Take me back, yeah)
All the way back
Oh, take me back to my first love
[Spontaneous]
And I hear the Lord say
If you ask, He will do it
I hear the Lord say
If you ask, He will do it
He's not wanting to hide
Or wanting any distance
If there ever was distance
It's because we ran and hide
So I hear tonight, there's a fresh start
And it's only the beginning
I hear tonight there's a fresh start
Just lift your hands and receive it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
There's a fresh start
And it's right here, right now
A fresh start
And it's right here, right now
A fresh start
I prophesy, it's right here, right now
You don't have to beg, you don't have to beg for it
He wants to give it to you anyway
So I declare, there's a fresh start
And it's right here, right now
There's a fresh start
And it's right here, right now
Oh my
There's a fresh start
And it's right here, right now
There's a fresh start
[Outro]
When the storm's out on the ocean
And the violent wind get's to blowing
Oh, take me back, back
All the way back
Oh, take me back to my first love
