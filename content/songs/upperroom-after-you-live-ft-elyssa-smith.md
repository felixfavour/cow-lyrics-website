After You (Live) Lyrics

Father, I'm after Your heart
Father, I'm seeking Your face
You are all that I long for
Would You come fill this place?
[Pre-Chorus]
Just to gaze on, Your beauty is all I desire
Just to dwell in, Your presence is all I long for

Father, I'm after Your heart
Father, I'm seeking Your face
You are all that I long for
Would You come fill this place?
[Pre-Chorus]
Just to gaze on, Your beauty is all I desire
Just to dwell in, Your presence is all I long for
Your presence, Jesus, is all I'm in pursuit of
Just to be with You
How I long to be with You
Your presence, Jesus, is all I'm in pursuit of
It's just to be with You
How I long to be with You
You are all that I need
The most beautiful thing that my heart has ever seen
You're my treasure, my prize, my heart's great delight
Oh Jesus, You're everything
You are all that I need
The most beautiful thing that my heart has ever seen
You're my treasure, my prize, my heart's great delight
Oh Jesus, You're everything
[Bridge]
I'm after Your heart, after Your heart
I'm after Your heart, after Your heart
I'm after Your heart, after Your heart (This is my one thing, Lord)
I'm after Your heart, I'm after Your heart (This is my one thing, this is my one thing)
I'm after Your heart, I'm after Your heart
I'm after Your heart, after Your heart
Your presence, Jesus, is all I will pursue
Just to be with You
How I long to be with You
Your presence, Jesus, is all I will pursue
It's just to be with You
How I long to be with You
You are all that I need
The most beautiful thing that my heart has ever seen
You're my treasure, my prize, my heart's great delight
Oh Jesus, You're everything
You are all that I need
The most beautiful thing that my heart has ever seen
You're my treasure, my prize, my heart's great delight
Oh Jesus, You're everything
