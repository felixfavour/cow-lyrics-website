Mayday, mayday (Yeah)
The Earth is shaking (Yeah)
Who gon' save the babies (Yeah)
From another Bloody Sunday?
I'm singing mayday, mayday (Yeah)
They love me or they hate me (Yeah)
For my skin color (Yeah)
But you say I am your brother, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
The government keep lying to me
Telling me that they come to set the people free
But the power flows when you catch us on our knees
Heaven please, we're in a state of emergency
See we need a strong God, yeah
We need the real God, yeah
The God with the resurrection power from the grave
To take away the hate, to heal the human race, yeah
We need a, we need a, we need a, we need a, we need a, we need a
We need a strong God
See we need a, we need a, we need a, we need a, we need a, we need a
Yuh, yuh, yuh
