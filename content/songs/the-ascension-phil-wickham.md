[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
This is the start, of something amazing
A moment when Heaven touches Earth
Here in our heart, Lord, we are waiting
For something that's far beyond what we have seen or heard
Let us start the ascension, let's begin the climb
Up this Holy mountain where Your glory shines
Further up, further in
Just to be with You again
Let us start the ascension (Oh, oh, oh-whoa)
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh-whoa
Oh, oh, oh-whoa
Oh, oh, oh-whoa
Oh, oh, oh-whoa, oh
Oh, oh, oh-whoa
Oh, oh, oh-whoa
Oh, oh, oh-whoa
Oh, oh, oh-whoa, oh
