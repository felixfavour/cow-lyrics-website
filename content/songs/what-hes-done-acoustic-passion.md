See on the hill of Calvary
My Savior bled for me
My Jesus set me free
Look at the wounds that give me life
Grace flowing from His side
No greater sacrifice
[Chorus: Anna Golden]
What He's done, what He's done
All the glory and the honor to the Son
My sins are forgiven, my future is Heaven
I praise God for what He's done
Sing! For the freedom He has won
Even death is dead and done
His life has overcome
Speak! Say the Name abovе all names
Over evеry broken place
He is risen from the grave
[Chorus: Kristian Stanfill, Tasha Cobbs Leonard, & Anna Golden]
What He's done, what He's done
All the glory and the honor to the Son
My sins are forgiven, my future is Heaven
I praise God for what He's done
