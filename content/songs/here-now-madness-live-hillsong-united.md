Skies spin their dance within Your breath
Time runs its race within Your hand
And my mind runs wild to comprehend
What no mind on earth could understand
[Pre-Chorus]
Your ways are higher
Your thoughts are wilder
Love came like madness
Poured out in blood-washed romance
It makes no sense but this is grace
And I know You're with me in this place
Here now
Still my heart
Let Your voice be all I hear now
Here now
Fix my eyes on things that I can't see now
Spirit breathe like the wind
Come have Your way
Cause I know You're in this place
Faith makes a fool of what makes sense
But grace found my heart where logic ends
When justice called for all my debts
The Friend of sinners came instead
