"Crossover"
Walking out of slavery
Into all that God has planned for me
Chains are falling at my feet
Moving forward now I see
My past can't go with me
As I step into my destiny now
We walk to freedom
What we see right now we'll never see again
As we crossover to Your promise
Our past, behind us
Nothing can stop us now
As we crossover to Your promise
Who I was before I leave
There is so much more waiting for me
Walls are falling at my feet
Moving forward now I see
My past can't go with me
As I step into my destiny
My past can't go with me
As I step into my destiny now
We walk to freedom
What we see right now we'll never see again
As we crossover to Your promise
Our past, behind us
Nothing can stop us now
As we crossover to Your promise
Out of the grave back into life
From under shame into Your light
There are no chains on the other side
We're crossing over, over
[x3]
My past can't go with me
As I step into my destiny now
We walk to freedom
What we see right now we'll never see again
As we crossover to Your promise
Our past, behind us
Nothing can stop us now
As we crossover to Your promise
