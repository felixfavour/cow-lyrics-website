Rock of the ages
Beginning and end
Light of salvation
My very best friend
Bright morning star
Savior and soon coming King
He's the Lord
Alpha Omega
The first and the last
Lord of creation
My future and past
Bright morning star
Savior and soon coming King
He's the Lord
Chorus:
Lamb of God seated on the throne
He is the Lord
Son of God, Son of Man
He's the Lord
He's the King
Hear the angels sing
Bright morning star
Savior and soon coming King
He's the Lord
