Bow down and worship Him
Bow down and worship Him
Worship Him, oh worship Him

Jesus, the king (Jesus, the King of kings)
Jesus, the King of kings
Worship (worship Him)
We've come to worship (oh, worship Him)

Before the earth was formed, You are God
We bow before Your throne, oh God and
We just wanna give You praise tonight
We just wanna give You praise
We cannot make it without You
And we cannot make it without Your power
Jesus
If it wasn't of Your love
And Your faithfulness to the cross
Where would we be?
