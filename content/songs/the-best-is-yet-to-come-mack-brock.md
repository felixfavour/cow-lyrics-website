Faithful from beginning, look how far You've brought me
Where would I have been without Your love?
Faithful to the ending, You have never left me
I will not forget what You have done
[Chorus: Mack Brock]
The best is yet to come, You know just what I need
You know me by my name, You never miss a thing
My future's gonna be alright, I don't need to know where it leads
If I only know one thing, I know You go with me
The best is yet to come
Your hand will always guide me, Your love will always find me
There's joy in bеing right where I belong
And if my feet should stumblе and if my heart should wander
You will be the light that leads me home
[Chorus: Mack Brock]
The best is yet to come, You know just what I need
And You know me by my name, You never miss a thing
And my future's gonna be alright, I don't need to know where it leads
If I only know one thing, I know You go with me
The best is yet to come
The best is yet to come
