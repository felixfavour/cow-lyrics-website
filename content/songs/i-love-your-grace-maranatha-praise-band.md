I love Your Grace, I love Your Mercy
I love the way You help me when I call
I love Your Truth, I love the power of Your name
But you know I love Your presence most of all
I love Your Grace, I love Your Mercy
I love the way You help me when I call
I love Your Truth, I love the power of Your name
But you know I love Your presence most of all
My soul takes refuge in the shadow of Your wings
Close to You is wherе I want to be
You are my Strength, You arе my God
You are my King
And all I want is what You want for me
I love Your Grace, I love Your Mercy
I love the way You help me when I call
I love Your Truth, I love the power of Your name
But you know I love Your presence most of all
My soul takes refuge in the shadow of Your wings
Close to You is where I want to be
You are my Strength, You are my God
You are my King
And all I want is what You want for me
