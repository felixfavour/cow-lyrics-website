I had broken dreams
I was so full of pain
Then You came
And now I'll never be the same again
I had tried it all
Lord knows I wanted a change, yeah
And right then, You came
And now, I'll never be the same again
I will never be the same, oh no
I'll never be the same, mmm
I will never be the same, oh no, no, no
And it's all because You came
Lord, You came
Oh yeah
Back was against the wall
Nowhere to run
Then You sent Your son
And now, I'll never be the same again
I just threw up my hands
And said, "Lord, here I am"And You were right there
And now, I'll never be the same again
