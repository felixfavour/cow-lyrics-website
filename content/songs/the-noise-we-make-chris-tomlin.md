This is the noise we make
With our voice and with our hands
We come to celebrate all across His land
Yeah
The joy that's in our hearts
Makes us want to dance for You
Join as the angels sing and worship as they do
And we worship You alone with our songs and praise
One day before Your throne
This is the noise we make

[x2]
You are worthy worthy
You are worthy worthy
You are holy holy
You are holy holy
