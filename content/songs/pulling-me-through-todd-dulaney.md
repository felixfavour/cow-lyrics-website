Lord its been you
Through all i have gone through Lord it was you
Chorus:
Through all i have gone through Lord it was you
Lord it was you x2
It was You , It was You that now pulling me through
It was you, Lord it was You pulling me through
when I stumbled, when I cried when it felt like I wanted to die
when my friends turned and they walked away
you were right here right here to stay
It was You It was You pulling me through
It was you, Lord it was You pulling me through
Yes, when I stumbled, when I cried when it felt like I wanted to die
When my friends turned and they walked away
You were right here, right here to stay
It was you, Lord it was You
