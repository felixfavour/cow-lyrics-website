Just wanna share, share something with you,
Everybody, Good thing, wanna bring some good news
Every city, I travel to
I ask a Christian, why do they believe
Is it nature, or a feeling
Or some sense of destiny
Did you find God in logic
Or did church come with your last name
No the number one reason they say He's real
Is ever since they met Him they've been changed
Jesus
Jesus
He's the only one
That can help you
If you go to Him
And be sincere
His blood will restore your soul
Restore your soul,
Don't worry
No one can judge you
We're all sinners in need of grace (yes we are)
And no matter what,
God will love you
Just make sure you're among the save
See, He already knows (already knows)
The real you (the real you)
So go on and bare your soul
Cause He can pick up the broken pieces
Of your life and make it whole
Jesus (oh I'm convinced that)
Jesus
He's the only one
That can help you
If you go to Him (when you pray to Him)
And be sincere
His blood (it)
Will (will)
Restore your soul
Yes it will
His name is (Jesus)
Jesus, He's my savior, He's my friend
The lover of my soul (Jesus)
Jesus, when I call Him, He came running
He came running, just for me (Jesus)
When I pray, He came to fix it
He came to see, about me His child yeah (Jesus)
And I know He will do the same for you
When you go to Him
And be sincere
His blood will restore your soul
