I don't need the smoke or mirrors
'Cause I know there's a God who's real
I don't need the lights to fool me
'Cause I have seen the God who heals
[Pre-Chorus]
I know when I ask I'll receive it
'Cause You're not a God who withholds
I hear You say, "Just believe me"I need a Holy Ghost, awaken in my soul
I need a love that glows, rattling my bones 'til the evidence shows
I need a Holy Ghost, awaken in my soul
I need a heart on fire that'll never grow tired wherever I go
[Post-Chorus]
I need a
Holy, Holy Ghost, I need a Ghost
Holy, Holy Ghost, I need a Ghost
I don't need a counterfeit comfort
'Cause nothing in this world remains
I need something stronger than lightning
Flowing inside of these veins
