Beauty for ashes
Life evermore
Peace beyond measure
Jesus won it all
Saved out of darkness
Cleansed by His blood
Into His Kingdom
By the power of God
He has won it, my salvation
My forgiveness, at the cross
He is healing, He's redemption
For whoever would come
He has won, that's the cross
All can take freely
Water of life
Let all who thirst, come
Worship Jesus Christ
He has won it, my salvation
My forgiveness, at the cross
He is healing, He's redemption
For whoever would come
He has won, that's the cross
