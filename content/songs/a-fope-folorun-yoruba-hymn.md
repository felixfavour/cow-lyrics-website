A fope f'Olorun lokan ati lohun wa:
[Now thank we all our God, with heart and hands and voices,]
Eni sohun 'yanu, n'nu Eni taraye n yo.
[Who wondrous things has done, in whom this world rejoices;]
Gba ta wa lomo'wo, Oun na lo n toju wa,
[Who from our mothers’ arms has blessed us on our way]
O si febun ife se'toju wa sibe.
[With countless gifts of love, and still is ours today.]

Oba Onibuore, ma fi wa sile lailai,
[O may this bounteous God through all our life be near us,]
Ayo ti ko lopin oun 'bukun yoo je tiwa.
[With ever joyful hearts and blessèd peace to cheer us;]
Pa wa mo ninu ore, to wa 'gba ba damu,
[And keep us in His grace, and guide us when perplexed;]
Yo wa ninu ibi laye ati lorun.
[And free us from all ills, in this world and the next!]

Ka fiyin oun ope f'Olorun Baba, Omo
[All praise and thanks to God the Father now be given;]
Ati Emi Mimo ti O ga julo lorun
[The Son and Him who reigns with Them in highest Heaven;]
Olorun kan lailai taye atorun n bo
[The one eternal God, whom earth and Heaven adore;]
Bee l'O wa d'isinyi,  beeni y'O wa lailai.
[For thus it was, is now, and shall be evermore.]
