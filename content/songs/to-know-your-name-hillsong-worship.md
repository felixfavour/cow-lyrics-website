The precious blood of Jesus Christ redeems
Forgiven I'm alive, restored, set free
Your Majesty resides inside of me
Forever I believe, forever I believe
Arrested by Your truth and righteousness
Your grace has overwhelmed my brokenness
Convicted by Your spirit, led by Your word
Your love will never fail, Your love will never fail
'Cause I know You gave
The world Your only Son for us
To know Your name
To live within the Savior's love
And He took my place
Knowing He'd be crucified
And You loved, You loved
A people undeserving
'Cause I know You gave
The world Your only Son for us
To know Your name
To live within the Savior's love
And He took my place
Knowing He'd be crucified
And You loved, You loved
A people undeserving
