I'm Still Here
Sop & Alto: I'm still here through
The story of life. I'm still here
Through the pain and the strife
I'm still here and I can't understand
How I made it this far
Solo: Yes I'm still here and I'll
Admit there were times when I
Thought, thought I was losing
My mind but the Lord came and
He gave me the strength and
I made it this far. Yes I did
Solo: I'm still here though some
Said I was done. I'm still here
I've got farther to run and I can't
Look behind me again cause
I made it, I made it. I made it
Choir: And I'm sure that I
Would have surely died if it
Had not been for God
God on my side. Yes I survived
Somehow and it's too late now
For I know what, know what
God has planned will stand oh
