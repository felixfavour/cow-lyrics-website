Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is peace
Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is healing
I know the Spirit of the Lord is living in me
Holy Spirit, fall like fire
Burn away everything not of You
Holy Spirit, fall like fire
Burn away everything not of You
Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there's forgiveness
Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is life
And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there's salvation
I know the Spirit of the Lord will be my guide
Holy Spirit, fall like fire
Burn away everything not of You
Holy Spirit, fall like fire
Burn away everything not of You
[Bridge]
The spirit of fear cannot live here
The spirit of shame must disappear
There's power, power, power in Your presence
The spirit of doubt, it has no place
The spirit of death has been erased
There's power, power, power in Your presence
The spirit of fear cannot live here
The spirit of shame must disappear
There's power, power, power in Your presence
The spirit of doubt, it has no place
The spirit of death has been erased
There's power, power, power in Your presence
Spirit of God, You're welcome here
