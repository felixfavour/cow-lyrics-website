The heavens were 
silent
The earth weeped in pain
Nations were trembling and hope never came
A Terror filled the air
And it wouldn't go away
We needed a hero to come and save the day...
Famine and hunger
Disease in the land
The hatred the killing taking lives from your hand
Creation waits through the darkness we pray
Tell me where is the hero to come and save the day...
Through the nails
Through the thorns
From the hill to the grave
Was a voice in the distance the lamb that was slain
My soul had no song and my debt I couldn't pay
When I needed a hero you came and you saved the day...
To the homeless
The widow
The fatherless son
To the sick and the broken alone with no one
Lift up your head your hope is on the way
When we needed a hero you came and you saved the day
