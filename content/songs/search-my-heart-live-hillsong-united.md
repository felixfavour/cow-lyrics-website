Search my heart and search my soul
There is nothing else that I want more
Shine Your light and show Your face
In my life Lord have Your way
So with all my heart and all my soul
With all I am, Lord, I will follow You
Hear my cry and hear my prayer
Draw me close I know you're near
Give me strength and give me grace
To walk with You Lord, all my days
So with all my heart and all my soul
With all I am, Lord, I will follow You
You took the cross, You took my shame
Restored my life, Now I live to worship You
[Bridge]
Without You I am nothing
Without You I am nothing
