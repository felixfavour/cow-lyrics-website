Your mercy falls with the rain
Your power's displayed in the wild ocean
Your presence will always remain
Jesus, Your love reaches to the Heavens
You are God
High above the Earth
Angels sing for You
Mountains melt at the sound of Your name
Oceans roar for You
All of creation gives You praise
You are God
High above the Earth
You are God
Oh, You are
Jesus, You're all that I need
Here is my life, come and take it from me
Jesus, You make me complete
With You at my side, I can know no boundaries
You are God
High above the earth
