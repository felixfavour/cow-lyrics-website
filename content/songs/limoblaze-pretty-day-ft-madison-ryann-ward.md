The sun is shining is a new day
got to be grateful in every way
the better singing it's a pretty song
feels like a day to get my cruise on
oh you got to love this feeling
feels there is someone to believe him
don't let the weight on your shoulder control ya
me I go dey do like say na nothing
won't let the negativity control me
I'm making my attitude a choice now
today choose joy
it's gonna be a pretty day for me
I throw my hands up in the air I'm free
it's only time, I know my wounds gonna heal
I look around, I know that God is real
it's gonna be a pretty day for me
I throw my hands up in the air I'm free
it's only time , I know my wounds gonna to heal
I look around I know that God is real
There are days that I cried in the rain
days that I drown in the pain
I tell myself that.. ( today ain't gonna be that day)
I tell myself that .. (today I'm gonna be okay )
a better way , in a way now
ain't really in a thing now
tell all the pain go to sleep
let me breathe , let me breathe now..
me I go dey do like say na nothing
won't let the negativity control me
I'm making my attitude a choice now
today I choose joy
it's gonna be a pretty day for me
I throw my hands up in the air I'm free
it's only  time, I know my wounds gonna heal
(oh oh oh)
I look around I know that God is real
 (oh oh oh)
it's gonna be a pretty day for me
 (oh oh oh)
I throw my hands up in the air I'm free
 (oh oh oh)
it's only time, I know my wounds gonna heal
(oh oh oh)
I look around I know that God is real..
it's gonna be a pretty day
be a pretty day for me
I don't know
