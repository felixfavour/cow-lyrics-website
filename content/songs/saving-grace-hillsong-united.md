Night and day I seek Your face
Long for You in the secret place
All I want in this life
Is to truly know You more
As the waters cover the sea
So Your love covers me
Guiding me on roads unknown
I trust in You alone
As the waters cover the sea
So Your love covers me
Guiding me on roads unknown
I trust in You alone
My saving grace, my endless love
Deeper and deeper, I'm falling in love with You
My one desire my only truth
Deeper and deeper I'm falling in love with You
As the waters cover the sea
So Your love covers me
Guiding me on roads unknown
I trust in You alone
My saving grace, my endless love
Deeper and deeper, I'm falling in love with You
My one desire my only truth
Deeper and deeper I'm falling in love with You
With You fallin' in love with You ohh
And I will rise on wings of eagles
Soaring high above all my fears
I rest in Your open arms of love
My saving grace, my endless love
Deeper and deeper, I'm falling in love with You
My one desire my only truth
Deeper and deeper I'm falling in love with You
My saving grace, my endless love
Deeper and deeper, I'm falling in love with You
My one desire my only truth
Deeper and deeper I'm falling in love with You
As the waters cover the sea
So Your love covers me, covers me
