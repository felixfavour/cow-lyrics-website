Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
Does his successive journeys run
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore
'till moons shall wax and wane no more
Blessings abound where'er He reigns
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains
The weary find eternal rest
And all the sons of want are blest
Jesus shall reign
Jesus shall reign
Open your hearts and welcome Him
And Jesus shall rеign
Jesus shall reign
Jesus shall rеign
Open your hearts and welcome Him
And Jesus shall reign
People and realms from every nation tongue
Dwell on his love with sweet strong
Voices of children shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name
