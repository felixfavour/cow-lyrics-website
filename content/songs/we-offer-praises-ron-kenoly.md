[Chorus]
We offer praises to You
Almighty God
Now and forever
You are Holy and worthy to be praised
(Repeat Chorus)
You are Holy
And worthy to be worshipped and adored
Yesterday, today and forevermore
You are glorious
With endless love
You are righteousness and truth
Mercy, peace, pure joy
And love abounds in You
We offer praises to You
Almighty God
Now and forever
You are Holy and righteous
And loving and powerful
And worthy to be praised
