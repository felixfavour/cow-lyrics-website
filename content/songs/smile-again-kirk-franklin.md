No reason to give up
No reason to turn around
No matter what you're going through
I want you to know
Tell me how you feel
When you're all alone
No one to say I love you
And you feel your hope is gone
Try to call your best friend
But he's not there
So you wind up feeling empty
Like no one cares
My brother don't worry
The storm don't last always
For there's a man from glory
Full of mercy and grace
[Chorus:]
He'll pick you up
He'll hold your hand
He'll ease your pain
So you can smile again
He'll pick you up
He'll hold your hand
He'll ease your pain
So you can smile again
Good God Almighty
