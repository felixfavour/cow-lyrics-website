I'll never be more loved than I am right now
Wasn't holding You up
So, there's nothing I can do to let You down
It doesn't take a trophy
To make You proud
I'll never be more loved than I am right now, oh
Going through a storm, but I won't go down
I hear Your voice carried
In the rhythm of the wind to call me out
You would cross an ocean so I wouldn't drown
You've never been closer than You are right now
[Chorus: Naomi Raine & Chandler Moore, 
Chandler Moore
]
Let's sing it out y'all
You are Jireh, You are enough
Jireh, You are enough
And I will be content (
Even in it
)
In every circumstance
(
You arе
) Jireh, (
You are
) You are еnough
[Post-Chorus: Naomi Raine & Chandler Moore, 
Chandler Moore
]
Forever enough, always enough
More than enough
Forever enough, always enough
More than enough
