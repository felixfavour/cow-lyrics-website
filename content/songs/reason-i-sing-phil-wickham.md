You brought me from darkness
And clothed me in garments of praise
Jesus, forever
My song will be You
Yeah!
I'm living in freedom
You've taken my burdens away
Jesus, forever
My song will be You
Only for You
For the cross that You bore
And the debt that You paid (Paid!)
For the victory You won over death and the grave
And this is the reason I sing
For the hope that You give
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that Heaven
Is waiting for me
And this is the reason I sing
(Oh-ooh)
(Ooh-oh)
