Forensic science teaches us
Life has a voice
One drop can identify
Who's committed a crime
Don't tell him
To [?]
Those that can hear
Have no reason to fear
No weight on their shoulder
Because of the blood I'll pass over
Kane killed Abel
There was blood of the ground
It was blood brought up from the ground
Angels (angels)
Years later
Another Lamb they slay
But his blood cried out, forgiveness, peace
Protection, prosperity, mercy, healing
It spoke a different word than Abel's
Abel spoke vengeance, violence, pain, hurt
But Jesus' love speaks a better word than Abel's
