You thought of me
When You died on the Cross
Nothing Compares to
The Love that You've Shown
I wanna do Life with Jesus
I wanna do Life Your Way
You thought of me
When You died on the Cross
And nothing Compares to
The Love that You've Shown
I wanna do Life with Jesus
I wanna do Life Your Way
Your Way, Your Way
I wanna do Life Your Way O
Your Way
I wanna do Life Your Way
You said You'll never
Let me go, Lord
And Your Grace is there.
To Follow Me
Your Mercy is Everything
That Keeps me
How would I do Life without You
Imami YO, O Imami YO
Ami wenu K'sufo
I wanna do Life Your Way
You thought of me
When You died on the Cross
Nothing Compares to
The Love that You've Shown
I wanna do Life with Jesus
I wanna do Life Your Way
