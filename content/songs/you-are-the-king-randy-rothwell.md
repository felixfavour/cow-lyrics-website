You are the King and You reign forever
You are the Lord and for You've triumphed over every foe
And we praise You
You are the King and You reign forever
You are the Lord and we worship no one else but You
You are God
With wisdom and authority
You scattered all your enemies
Boasting in Your Triumph over them
And with the strength of Your right hand
The truth declared across the land
Your awesome power has conquered over all
You are the King and You reign forever
You are the Lord and for You've triumphed over every foe
And we praise You
You are the King and You reign forever
You are the Lord and we worship no one else but You
You are God
With wisdom and authority
You scattered all your enemies
Boasting in Your Triumph over them
And with the strength of Your right hand
The truth declared across the land
Your awesome power has conquered over all
