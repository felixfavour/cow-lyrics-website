Verse
I'll Worship You
In reaching out
To speak these words
Into Your heart
I'll worship You
My Lord my God
With faith declare
My love for You
Chorus:
I'll worship You
With all my heart
And all my strength
And in Your presence
Lord, my God, my King
I'll worship You
I'll worship You
So let these words
Reflect my heart
To make these songs
Be seen in me
And living life
As living truth
In all I am
And hope to be
