Looking at the landscape of this broken life
Treehouse to decipher, if anything survived
Plants that quiet an infant
But radiance for miles
The southern coast of Florida to the hills of Carolinas
And everything has changed (Has changed)
When you'reâjustâaâkid, words canâtake a toll
Andâword I'm feeling spoken, 'cause stealin' apples gold
Stranded in the fallout, wounded in the long
This is any burden seems anybody home
And everything has changed
Is this what growing up is supposed to look like?
Thought I'd be learning how to love, instead I've only learned to fight
And I was only trying to walk beside You
I guess I just got in the way
Sometimes all you need is the medicine of time
To lead you to the gold beneath the wreckage of your mind
'Cause I was not your failure and you were never mine
And we were made to see through much more sympathetic eyes
But everything has changed
Is this what growing up is supposed to look like?
Thought I'd be learning how to love, instead I've only learned to fight
And I was only trying to walk beside You
I guess my pride got in the way
But if I ever caused the pain, could I be the first to say?
That I'm sorry
I won't give up on You, if You don't want me to
I won't give up on You, but You expect me to
I can't give up on You, even if You want me to
I won't give up on You, I don't know what I'd do
But everything has changed
