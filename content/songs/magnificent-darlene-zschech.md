Who compares to You?
Who set the stars in their place?
You who calmed the raging seas
That came crashing over me
Who compares to You?
You who brings the morning light
The hope of all the earth
Is rest assured in Your great love
You are magnificent eternally
Wonderful, glorious
Jesus, no one ever will compare
To You Jesus
Where the evening fades
You call forth songs of joy
As the morning wakes
We Your children give You praise
You are magnificent eternally
Wonderful, glorious
Jesus, no one ever will compare
