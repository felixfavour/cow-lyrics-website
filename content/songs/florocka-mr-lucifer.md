I guess I got to do this
It's been a long time coming
There's always two sides to a story, you know
So here's mine
Verse 1
Hello Mr Lucifer
I tried to call you, tried to text you
But you won't pick
So i decided to make up my lines just like a pro[?]
'Cos I know you love music
I wanna be talking about somethings that kinda be bugging my mind
Eleven years, six months
Yeah, I know it's quite a while
Better late than never
You know I do better with word[?] of righteousness
I ain't like you, I don't jagger[?]
If you really got something to say, quit using the
It kinda puts you low, like you're singing on the wrong key
I don't know what be going on on your mind
but i know you're an angel that is fallen
You think you're balling?
You used to be an angel of perfection but now
you're nothing but a lie and a deception
[?]
pointless, aimless, chatting about the previous
'Cos everybody knows you're just a buff[?]
and God's the genius
Chorus:
Mr Lucifer tell me why you wanna run me down
with everything God's done for you, you are so ungrateful
Ya[?] used to be an angel of light but you
turned into the father of liars
Just a matter of time everybody gonna see your crime, Mr Lucifer
Verse 2
So you found your way into the garden of Eden
deceived Adam and Eve just like you planned it
(hmm, for the back of your mind you don think sey mankind don kpa) (chai)
What a blunder (eeh oh)
 [?] in heaven and earth is yours
(you even have the audacity to tempt the king of kings, chai)
Tell me, how can God steal what you never had
break what you never built
luc...youre hilarious
Lemme juggle your memory
Who named you
Resp: Jehovah
Who made you an angel
Resp: Jehovah
Tell me who made you a cherubim
Resp: The very same Jehovah
I think you're becoming a victim of your own deception
You can fool everybody but you can't fool me
Those who can't decipher you are those without the nature of Christ in them
I ain't one of them because i got my eyes on the prize - that's right
Chorus:
Mr Lucifer tell me why you wanna run me down
with everything God's done for you, you are so ungrateful
Ya[?] used to be an angel of light but you
turned into the father of liars
Just a matter of time everybody gonna see your crime, mr Lucifer
Verse 3
I kinda find it funny, you think God competes with you?
(you wish)
Really? You gat to be high on voodoo
So tell me, what's going to be the basis of this competition
Is it going to be loyalty or is it going to be truth
Let me make you understand something, you might be able to turn the world against me
but you can never stop God from loving me
healing my broken heart
stop him from blessing me
yeah you broke my spirit and you broke my confidence
yea, but you never broke my faith
every hurt you and put on me makes me stronger
now I can fix eleven years of my blunder
what the flip was i thinking trying to commit suicide
that's what you get when you push Jesus by the side
I'm staring at my future, engaging you doesn't make sense cos you're officially my past tense.
Chorus:
Mr Lucifer tell me why you wanna run me down
with everything God's done for you, you are so ungrateful
Ya[?] used to be an angel of light but you
turned into the father of liars
Just a matter of time everybody gonna see your crime mr Lucifer
you heard that?
