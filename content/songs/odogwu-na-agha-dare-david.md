Odogwu na'agha dike na'agha
You're the mighty man of war
Odogwu na'agha dike na'agha
You have won it all for me

You won the battle in my favor
And you gave me the victory 
You are my helper, my defender
You will never let me down 

Odogwu na'agha dike na'agha
You're the mighty man of war
Odogwu na'agha dike na'agha
You have won it all for me

You won the battle in my favor
And you gave me the victory 
You are my helper, my defender
You will never let me down 

Mighty one mighty one
You have won it all for me

Strong and mighty 
Strong and mighty 
You have won it all for me

Odogwu na'agha 
Odogwu na'agha
You have won it all for me

Strong and mighty 
Strong and mighty 
You have won it all for me

Odogwu na'agha dike na'agha
You're the mighty man of war
Odogwu na'agha dike na'agha
You have won it all for me
