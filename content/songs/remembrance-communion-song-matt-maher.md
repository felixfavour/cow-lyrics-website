Oh how could it be
That my God would welcome me
Into this mystery
Say take this bread, take this wine
Now the simple made divine
For any to receive
By mercy, we come to your table
By your grace, you are making us faithful
Lord, we remember you
And remembrance leads us to worship
And as we worship you
Our worship leads to communion
We respond to your invitation
We remember you
See his body, his blood
Know that he has overcome
Every trial we will face
None too lost to be saved
None too broken or ashamed
All are welcome in this place
By your mercy, we come to your table
By your grace, you are making us faithful
