Jesus Jesus Jesus
There's just something
Something about that name
He's master my Savior king Jesus
Like a fragrance after the rain
Jesus Jesus my Jesus
Let all heaven and earth proclaim

That kings
Kings and kingdoms
They will all pass away
Oh but there's something
Yes there's something
Something supernatural
Something so incredible
Something so powerful 
(Something so wonderful)
There's something about that namе
