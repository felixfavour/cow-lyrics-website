The spring of April's gone
The leaves have all turned brown
The children are all grown up
And there's no one around
I'm looking over my life
And all the mistakes I made
And I'm afraid, afraid
(
Listen
)
Somebody told me that You would wash all my sins
(
Hallelujah
)
And cleanse me from the scars that are so deep within
So I'm calling to You
If you can hear me, I don't know how
(
He's never too busy
)
I was wondering, can you hold me now?
(
You are the only one
)
You are the only one that's patient when I fall
(
And your angels
)
Your angels come to save me every time I call
(
That's why I love you
)
You don't laugh at me when I make mistakes and cry
(
You're not like man
)
You're not like man
(
You understand
)
You understand me
See people change
One day they don't like you, the next they do
(
You know that's wrong
)
I wish that everyone could love me just like You
So here I am this sinful man peace won't allow
I was wondering, can you hold me now?
(
Hallelujah
)
I was wondering, can you hold me now?
