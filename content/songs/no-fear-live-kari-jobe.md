Right now anything can happen
Right here everything can change
It is time, cast all your cares upon Him
Right here, right now
No fear
Don't fret
Just run into His presence
Just know He's got every single tear
Be cleansed in the holy rain of Jesus
Right here, right now
No fear
Just turn your eyes upon Jesus
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Right here, right now
No fear
Right here, right now
No fеar
Take heart, His name is your dеfender
Be glad and know that He is God
Don't wait, just run into His presence
Right here, right now
No fear
