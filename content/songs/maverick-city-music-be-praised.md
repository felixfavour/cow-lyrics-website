You spoke those words, "Let there be light"
And it was, oh
And in that same breath, the stars fell in line
With one voice, creation cries
"You do all things well
You do all things well"
Be praised
Be praised
Forever and always
Ooh
Lost in the dark up under the dirt
I was buried, left to die
And I heard Your voice calling my name
From the tomb, I came alive
You do all things well
From the tomb, I came alive
You do all things well
Be praised
Be praised
Be praised, King Jesus
Be praised forever
Be praised, oh
Be praised forever
Forever and always
Hey, oh
Be magnified, be glorified, yeah
Oh, when I think of all You've done
And all the battles You've brought me over
Hallelujah, woo
And all the storms I saw Him calm
In my defense, my only song is
Hallelujah, oh
And how He never let me fall
Now unto Him who is able
Hallelujah, thank You, Jesus, Lord
And let there never be a day
That I don't rise to bring You praise
Hallelujah, oh, hallelujah
Be praised
Be praised
Be praised (Oh)
Be praised (You're so good, God)
Be praised (For Your faithfulness)
Be praised (Oh)
Be praised (Forever)
Forever and always
Well, that's how long You're worthy
Well, that's how long I'll bring You praise
Well, that's how long You're worthy
So that's how long I'll bring You praise (That's how long)
That's how long You're worthy (Forever and always)
And that's how long I'll bring You praise (That's how long You're worthy)
That's how long You're worthy (Yeah)
And that's how long I'll bring You praise
Come on, lift it up, that's how long
That's how long You're worthy (So that's how long)
That's how long I'll bring You praise (Forever and always)
That's how long You're worthy (That's how long)
That's how long I'll bring You praise (Oh, that's how long You're worthy)
That's how long You're worthy (That's how long You're faithful)
That's how long I'll bring You praise (That's how long You're good)
That's how long You're worthy (Yeah)
So that's how long I'll bring You praise
Forever and always
Forever and always
Forever and always
Forever and always
Forever and always (Forever)
Forever and always (Forever)
Forever and always
Forever is a long time
And we're gonna spend every moment with You
Forever is a long time
(Forever is a long time)
When I think of all You've done
And all the battles You've brought me over
Hallelujah, woo, oh-oh
And all the storms I saw Him calm
In my defense, my only song is
Hallelujah, glory, hallelujah, hey
And how He never let me fall
Now unto Him who is able
Hallelujah, oh
And let there never be a day
That I don't rise to bring You praise
Hallelujah, oh, when I think of all You've done
And when I think of all He's done
And all the battles You've brought me over
Hallelujah, I remember, I remember, I remember, yes, I do
Through all the storms I saw Him calm
In my defense, my only song is
Hallelujah, how could I be silent?
How could I be quiet when You've done so much?
Never let me fall
Now unto Him who is able
Hallelujah, oh, and let there never be a day
And let there never be a day
That I don't rise to bring You praise
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, be praised
Be praised
Be praised (From our hearts)
Be praised (With everything)
Be praised (With everything within us)
Be praised (Let everything that has breath)
Be praised (Forever)
Forever and always
