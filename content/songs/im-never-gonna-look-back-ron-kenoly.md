Never gonna look back
Never gonna look back
Never gonna look back till I reach heaven's gate
I left a life of sin with chains that dragged me down
Bright lights and voices calling me saying "Turn your heart around"That's when Jesus found me and He beckoned to me
And when I took His hand all those chains fell off of me
I'm never gonna look back, I've made up my mind
I've got too much invested to lose my time
Through the rivers, over the mountains and plains
I'm never gonna look back till I reach heaven's gates
There's always been two roads to travel since the first of time
One road is paved, the other road is gravel, that gravel road is mine
But when you're walking with Jesus, you don't care about looking back
Who cares about a highway when you're on the right track?
I'm never gonna look back, I've made up my mind
I've got too much invested to lose my time
Through the rivers, over the mountains and plains
I'm never gonna look back
I'm never gonna look back
I'm never gonna look back till I reach heaven's gates
