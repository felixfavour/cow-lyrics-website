I was lost in a moment, a glimmer in time
Like a child chasing shadows, my back to the light
I was lost in a fog till You caught my eye
Through the smoke and the mirrors, a glimmer of life
I know there's a place I belong
Where I'll see the fullness of love
A child face to face with my God
Lost in Your awesome wonder
While I wait, I will not be afraid
My faith will remain all the same
My hope in the things not yet seen
Found in the greatest of these
I found love in a moment, exploding in light
At the cross where the curtains, were ripped from my eyes
I found heaven in pieces, in glimmer and dust
Broken glass in reflection, till we shine like the sun
I know there's a place I belong
Where I'll see the fullness of love
A child face to face with my God
Lost in Your awesome wonder
While I wait, I will not be afraid
My faith will remain all the same
My hope in the things not yet seen
Found in the greatest of these
