Until the storm has ceased
Your voice will rise above the seas
We will not fear
You are still God
Here in the waters deep
Your hand will always be beneath
We will not fear
You are still God
We lift our eyes to You, Most High
Forever be exalted
Forever, You will be exalted
Our help will come from You, Most High
Forever be exalted
Forever, You will be exalted
And beyond eternity
You reign with all authority
And now You're near
You are with us
Impossibility
Remains no longer when You speak
And now You're near
You are with us
