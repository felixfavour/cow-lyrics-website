I thought that number one would surely be me. I thought I could be what I wanted to be. 

I thought that I could build on life's Sinking sand. But I can't even walk
Without You holding my hand. 

I thought had do a lot on my own
I thought I could make it all alone. I thought of myself

As a mighty, mighty big man. But I can't even walk
Without You holding my hand

I can't even walk, without you holding my hand. The mountains to high, and the valleys to wide. 

Down on my knees, I learned to stand, Lord, I can't even walk. Without you holding my hand.
