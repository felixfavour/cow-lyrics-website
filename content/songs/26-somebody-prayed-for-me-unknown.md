I was lost and alone in a cold dark world; no peace of mind or freedom could I see. But little did I know I had a friend somewhere. Someone I didn't know saw some good in me. 

Somebody prayed for me, they had me on their mind, they sacrificed their time; they fell down on their knees and prayed for me. They had no doubt that God would bring me out; that He could change my life and set me free. I'm so glad that someone prayed for me. 

I trusted in the things that the world could give, not knowing soon that all would pass away. But because someone cared enough to enough to pray for me, I trusted God and now I'm saved today. 

Somebody prayed for me, they had me on their mind, they sacrificed their time; they fell down on their knees and prayed for me. They had no doubt that God would bring me out; that He could change my life and set me free. I'm so glad that someone prayed for me. 

I cursed the one who gave me breath each day, I criticized the ones who prayed for me. I said "you're all hypocrites, just go away." But because of their prayers, I'm saved today. 

Somebody prayed for me, they had me on their mind, they sacrificed their time; they fell down on their knees and prayed for me. They had no doubt that God would bring me out; that He could change my life and set me free. I'm so glad that someone prayed for me. 

I'm so glad that someone prayed for me. 
I'm so glad that someone prayed for me. 
I'm so glad that someone prayed for me.
