Chorus:
Created for worship, created to praise His name
Created to overcome, that's why I'm here...
God has a plan for me; He gave me all I need
No defeat, only victory; I was created for this
No defeat, only victory; I was created for this
(Repeat Chorus)
So I'm not worried
He wasn't given me a spirit of fear
But of love, joy, peace... and a sound mind
I was created in His image
With all power and authority;
I was created for this. I was created for this
(Chorus - Verse)
Bridge:
There's nothing that I cannot do
By the power inside of me
Authority that's over me
(2x)
