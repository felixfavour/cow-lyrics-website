Chorus:
It's not by my power
And it's not by might
I'm not that intelligent
But for grace
And when people ask me
This is all I can say
(Oh oh oh oh)
This is the finger of God
In my life
(Repeat Chorus x4)
I am all I am
And it is by His grace
I am all I am
And it is by Your grace
I am all I am
And it is by Your grace
I am all I am
It is by Your grace
I am all I am
It is by Your grace
I am all I am
It is by Your grace
I am all I am
It is by Your grace
I am all I am
It is by Your grace
(Instrumentals)
I am all I am
It is by His grace
I am all I am
It is by His grace
I am all I am
It is by His grace
I am all I am
It is by His grace
(Repeat x2)
And when people ask me
This is all I can say
This is the finger of God
In my life
(Repeat x4)
