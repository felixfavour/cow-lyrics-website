We're connected to this world through our senses
By what's tangible and easy to comprehend
There are days when it seems we're going nowhere
Trust your faith to show you the truth
Your status is changing, there's no more decline
I'm on my way to better days
Your status is changing, there's no more decline
I'm on my way to better days
We're connected to this world through our senses
By what's tangible and easy to comprehend
There are days when it seems
We're going nowhere fast
Trust your faith to show you the truth
Give a listen to what faith says to you:
Our status is changing, there's no more decline
I'm on my way to better days
Our status is changing, there's no more decline
I'm on my way to better days
My status is changing, there's no more decline
I'm on my way to better days
My status is changing, there's no more decline
I'm on my way to better days
I'm on my way, on my way
On my way to better days
(4x)
I'm on my way, I'm on my way
To better, to better, to better days, yeah...
I'm on my way, on my way
On my way to better days
(4x)
[Solo]
Better days are in You, Jesus...
My better life is in You, Jesus...
Life's changing is in You, Jesus...
My success is in You, Jesus...
All I have to do is to look to You...
Better days are with You...
My future is through You...
All I have to do is met through You, Jesus...
For a better life, yeah... yeah...
