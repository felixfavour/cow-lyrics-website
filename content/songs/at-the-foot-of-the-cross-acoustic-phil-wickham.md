I come for life, I come for peace
I come before you on my knees
Lord hear my cry, You're all I need
Oh God, I come to the cross
Here my debts have all been paid
Here my sins are washed away
Here my soul has found its place
At the foot of the cross
I once was lost but now Iâ€™m found
All my chains fall to the ground
Take this life I lay it down
At the foot of the cross
You gave your life, you bore my shame
My sins are buried in the grave
Without your love, I would be lost
Oh God, I come to the cross
Here my debts have all been paid
Here my sins are washed away
Here my soul have found its place
At the foot of the cross
