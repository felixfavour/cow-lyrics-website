[Intro: Brandon Lake]
We're gonna live, live forever
Live, live forever
Live, live forever
C'mon get your hands up, hands up
People of Heaven
Singing Hallelujah to You
For all we've been given
Saved and set apart
Ashes into art
Children of the King
Every promise kept
Only hope ahead
Lift your heart and sing
[Pre-Chorus: Phil Wickham & 
Brandon Lake
]
We're gonna live, live forever
We're gonna live forever, live forever
Yeah
C'mon get your eyes up, eyes up
People of Heaven
Yeah it's time to rise up, rise up
Show them what we've been given
He rolled that stone away
Called us from the grave
Every fear is gone
Risen and reborn
All our joy restored
Freedom is our song
