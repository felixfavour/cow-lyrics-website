I open my mouth and you speak for me
You move the mountains and roll back the sea
[Pre-Chorus]
I will not afraid
I will never be ashamed
For you are with me
You are with me
I've seen enough to know
That you're my only hope
I don't want to go
If you're not with me
If you're not with me
We open our hands and you reach for us
You are the motion of the universe
[Pre-Chorus]
[Bridge]
I open my mouth and you speak for me
You move the mountains and roll back the sea
I've seen enough to know
That you're my only hope
