Here am I
Lord, send me
Lord, send me, oh...
Here am I
Lord, send me
Lord, send me
Open my eyes
Lord, let me see
There are millions of people
Ready to hear and receive
Open my ears
Lord, let me hear
Hear the cry of the nations
From far and near
Saying come over there
Won't you please
Comе over here
Comе over here
We've been waiting to hear
Year after year
If You can't come yourself
Well, then send someone else
Send someone soon
Send someone soon
Will You send them today
Please don't delay
Won't You come over here, Lord
And show us the way
