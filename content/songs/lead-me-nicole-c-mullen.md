Hear my cry oh God, attend unto my prayer
From the ends of the earth, will I cry unto you
When my heart is overwhelmed and I can hardly stand
Lead me to the rock, lead me to the rock
When I’m calling on your name, may I never be ashamed
Lead me to the rock
Oh lead me x2
Lead me to the rock that’s higher than I
Verse 2 – Call and response
For thou has been, a shelter for me
And a strong tower, from the enemy
When my heart is overwhelmed and I can hardly stand
Lead me to the rock,- [lead me]
Lead me to the rock,- [lead me]
When I’m crying out to you and I don’t know what to do
Lead me to rooock
Chorus
O o o o lead me x2
Lead me to rock that’s higher than I
