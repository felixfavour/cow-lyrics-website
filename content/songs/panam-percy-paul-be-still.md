still and know
That I am God
(Sing with me) Be still and know
That I am God
Be still and know
That I am God
Be still and know
That I am God
I will be exalted
Among the nations
I will be exalted
Among the nations
I will be exalted
In the earth
I will be exalted
In the earth
The Lord of Host is with us
The God of Jacob is our refuge
The Lord of Host is with us
The God of Jacob is our refuge
Now we'll get into the song
And we'll get to this point that it says
I will be exalted
Now instead of singing I will be exalted
We will sing now You are exalted
And then we will personalize it at the end
Instead of singing the Lord of Host is with us
We will all sing the Lord of Host is with me
The God of Jacob is my refuge
Hallelujah
Be still and know
That I am God
Be still and know
That I am God
I will be exalted
Among the nations
I will be exalted
In the earth
The Lord of Host is with us
The God of Jacob is our refuge
The Lord of Host is with us
The God of Jacob is our refuge
Be still and know
That I am God
Be still and know
That I am God
I will be exalted
Among the nations
I will be exalted
In the earth
The Lord of Host is with us
The God of Jacob is our refuge
The Lord of Host is with us
The God of Jacob is our refuge
(Lord You are) Lord you are exalted
Among the nations
Lord you are exalted
In the earth
Lord you are exalted
Among the nations
Lord you are exalted
In the earth
Lord you are exalted
Among the nations
Lord you are exalted
In the earth
Lord you are exalted
Among the nations
Lord you are exalted
In the earth
The Lord of Host is with me
The God of Jacob is my refuge
The Lord of Host is with me
The God of Jacob is my refuge
The Lord of Host is with me
The God of Jacob is my refuge
Hallelujah
