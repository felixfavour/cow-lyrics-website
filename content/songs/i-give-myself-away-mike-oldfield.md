I give myself away
I give myself away to you, completely
I give myself away
I give myself away, it’s true, believe me
[Pre-Hook]
Here I am, here I stand
All my life is in your hands
And I’m longing to see
What my life was meant to be
I give myself away, away
I give myself away to you, completely
[Hook]
My life is not my own, to you I belong
I give myself, I give myself to you
My old life is gone, to you I belong
I give myself, I give myself, it’s true
[Pre-Hook]
