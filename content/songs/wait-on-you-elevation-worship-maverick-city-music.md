I don't believe in fairytales
I guess I've outgrown them
But that doesn't mean that I don't believe
That there's something bigger than me
'Cause I've seen, in a hospital room
When the doctors said, "Sorry
There's nothing more we can do"Well, it wasn't through
I've never seen a pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow
But I've got a promise I can hold
In the middle of the struggle
God, if You said it, You'll perform it
May not be how I want You to
But here's what I'll do
[Chorus: Dante Bowe & Chandler Moore]
I'm gonna wait on You
I'm gonna wait on You
I'vе tasted Your goodness
I'll trust in Your promise
I'm gonna wait on You
Yеs, I'm gonna wait on You (Yeah)
I've tasted Your goodness
I'll trust in Your promise
I'm gonna wait on You
Yes, I will, yes, I will (Oh)
I will, I will, I will (I will), yeah
