You are here
As we're lifting up Your Name
Lifting up Your Name
You are here
As we're giving You the praise
Giving You the praise
The Kingdom of God is released in this atmosphere
Where freedom and breakthrough and victory are right here
Where You are is where I wanna be
In Your presence
There's no place that I would rather be
'Cause with You Jesus
It's heaven on earth
It's heaven on earth
It's heaven on earth
It's heaven on earth
You are here
As we all agree
Your power is released
You are here
As Your Spirit falls
There are miracles
The Kingdom of God is released in this atmosphere
Where freedom and breakthrough and victory are right here
Where You are is where I wanna be
In Your presence
There's no place that I would rather be
'Cause with You Jesus
It's heaven on earth
It's heaven on earth
It's heaven on earth
It's heaven on earth
Wherever You are is freedom
I can feel it breaking out
The walls are coming down
Right now Jesus
This is heaven on earth
Wherever You are is freedom
I can feel it breaking out
The walls are coming down
Right now Jesus
This is heaven on earth
This is heaven on earth (Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)
This is heaven on earth (This is heaven...)
This is heaven on earth (In Your presence)
Oh, this is heaven on earth
Where you are is where I wanna be
In Your presence
There's no place that I would rather be
'Cause with You Jesus
It's heaven on earth
Wherever You are is freedom
I can feel it breaking out
The walls are coming down
Right now Jesus (This is heaven...)
This is heaven on earth
Wherever You are is freedom
I can feel it breaking out
The walls are coming down
Right now Jesus
This is heaven on earth
