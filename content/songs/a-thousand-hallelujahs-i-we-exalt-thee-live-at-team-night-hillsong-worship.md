(Here we go)
Who else would rocks cry out to worship?
Whose glory taught the stars to shine?
Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
But this joy is mine (Come on, lift your voice)
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
Who else would die for our redemption?
Whose resurrection means I’ll rise?
There isn’t time enough to sing of all You’ve done
But I have eternity to try (Amen)
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
A thousand more
