I stand with so many questions
But You know all of the answers
And whether this side of Heaven
I know that You are the Healer
And my heart will stay steadfast
I know that You are good
And my heart will stay steadfast
I know that You are good
Comforter You are to me
Shelter from the cold
Constant how You carry me
Never letting go
You are with me
Your voice holds me together
When I feel like Iâ€™m falling apart
I place my world in Your hands
You come and steady my heart
I feel you in the stillness
I know that You are good
I feel you in the stillness
I know that You are good
