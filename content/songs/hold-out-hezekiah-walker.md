I'm going to hold out
Gonna hold out 'til He comes
God has just begun to make a way
Make a way for me
I'm going to hold out
Gonna hold out 'til He comes
God has just begun to make a way, way
Storm clouds may rise, strong winds may blow
But I know the Lord will take me through it all;
(He'll make a way, way)
Storm clouds may rise, strong winds may blow
But I know the Lord will take me through it all;
(He'll make a way, make a way for me)
Storm clouds may rise, strong winds may blow
I know the Lord will take me through it all;
He'll make a way, way
Storm clouds may rise, strong winds may blow
I know the Lord will take me through it all;
He'll make a way, make a way for me
I'm going to hold out
Gonna hold out 'til He comes
Hold out 'til He comes
Hold out 'til He comes
Don't give up, don't give in
Hold out 'til He comes
[Ending:]
I'm going to hold out
Gonna hold out 'til He comes
God has just begun to make a way
Make a way for me
