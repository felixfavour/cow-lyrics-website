is sunshine is blinding
I wish I could make it last
Forever and ever
Seeking endeavors
Chess against checkers
Figure out what's waiting in store
My mind on the floor
My heart on the shore
The sun is going home
Yes, it's going home
Just want to know
What comes after the sunshine
What follows up on the rays
Someone told me that it's about time
Things will start to decay but
I'll be standing still
I'll be standing still
I'll be standing right here for you, oh
I'll be standing still
I'll be standing still
I'll be standing right here for you, oh
Oh
Right here for you oh
La, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
What comes after the sunshine
What follows up on the rays
Someone told me it's bout time
Things will start to decay but
I'll be standing still
I'll be standing still
I'll be standing right here for you, oh
I'll be standing still
I'll be standing still
I'll be standing right here for you, oh
