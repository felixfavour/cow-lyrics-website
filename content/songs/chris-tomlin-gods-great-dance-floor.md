Am coming back to the start
Where you find me
Am coming back to your heart
Now I surrender
Take me
This is all I can bring
Am coming back  to the start
Our God is freedom
And here we feel your heart
Your heart beat for  us
Take me
This is all I can bring
You never  stop loving us
No matter how  far we run
You never give up on us
All of heavens shout
let the future began
Let the future  began
Take me
This is all I can bring
You never stop loving us
No matter how  far we run
You never  give up on  us
All of heaven shout
let the future began
Let the future  began
I feel alive
I come alive
On God's  great dance  floor
I feel alive

On God's  great dance floor

On God' great dance foor
I feel alive

I am alive
On God great dance  floor
I fee alive

On God's great  dance floor
Oh on God's gre  dance  floor
