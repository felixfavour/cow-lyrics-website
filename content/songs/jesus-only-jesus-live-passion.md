Who has the power to raise the dead?
Who can save us from our sin?
He is our hope, our righteousness
Jesus, only 
Jesus
Who can make the blind to see?
Who holds the keys that set us free?
He paid it all to bring us peace
Jesus, only Jesus
Holy, King almighty Lord
Saints and angels all adore
I join with them and bow before
Jesus, only Jesus
Who can command the highest praise?
Who has the name above all names?
You stand alone, I stand amazed
Jesus, only Jesus
You will command the highest praise!
Yours is the name above all names!
You stand alone, I stand amazed
Jesus, only Jesus!
Jesus, only Jesus!
