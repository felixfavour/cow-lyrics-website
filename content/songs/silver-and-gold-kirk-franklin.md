Silver and gold
Silver and gold
I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold
No fame or fortune
Nor riches untold
I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold
Don't give me a mansion
On top of the hill
Don't give me the world
With a shallow thrill
But just give me a saviour
My life He can hold
I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold
I woke up this morning
Feeling kind of down
I called on my best friend
She could not be found
But I called on Jesus
My life He can hold
I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold
For unto us a child is born
A son is given
I'd rather have Jesus
What profits a man to gain the whole world and loose His soul
I'd rather have Jesus
For there's no other name given under heaven
Whereby we must be saved
I'd rather have Jesus
He's the only one that can save you
I'd rather have Jesus than silver and gold
