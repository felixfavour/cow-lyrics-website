Grace, what have you done?
Murdered for me on that cross
Accused in absence of wrong
My sin washed away in your blood
Too much to make sense of it all
I know that your love breaks my fall
The scandal of grace, you died in my place
So my soul will live
Oh to be like you
Give all I have just to know you
Jesus, there's no one besides you
Forever the hope in my heart
Death, where is your sting?
Your power is as dead as my sin
The cross has taught me to live
In mercy, my heart now to sing
The day and its trouble shall come
I know that your strength is enough
The scandal of grace, you died in my place
So my soul will live
Oh to be like you
Give all I have just to know you
Jesus, there's no one besides you
Forever the hope in my heart
Oh to be like you
Give all I have just to know you
Jesus, there's no one besides you
Forever the hope in my heart
And it's all because of you, Jesus
It's all because of you, Jesus
It's all because of your love
And my soul will live
Oh to be like you
Give all I have just to know you
Jesus, there's no one besides you
Forever the hope in my heart
Oh to be like you
Give all I have just to know you
Jesus, there's no one besides you
Forever the hope in my heart
