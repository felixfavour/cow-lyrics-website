[Intro: Kirk Franklin & 
TobyMac
]
TobyMac! (Huh!) Turn it up!
Kirk gonna get his white boy on!
God, I know You up to something (Uh!)
I can see it all right now (Woo!)
You pulling back my covers
It's getting crazy (Come on!)
Think I'm gonna walk away
You're messing up my life today (Wassup?)
This time I refuse to pray
Still you keep calling me (Calling me)
I don't wanna see your face
The thing I love you erased (Come on!)
Nothing but an empty space
Now I don't know how to be
I know it wasn't right for me (Yeah!)
What you liking what you need
I feel like I'm in surgery
Still you cut deeper
My secrets within
My blanket of sin
Lord how much longer 'till ya through with me
Please take what you need (Can I get up now?)
