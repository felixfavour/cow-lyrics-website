Everybody now lets go...
victory is my name
The Lord is my Shepherd
i shall not want
The Lord has provided
more than enough
no matter where i go oh oh oh
victory is my Name
My praise is stronger
 my joy over flowing
more than a song
 l'm celebrating
 sing a praise to you
 In midst of my enemies
 i will praise
in the midst of my enemies
 i praise i praise
with all of the power i'll ever need
i gonna put on my dancing shoes
 there's no way  that i can loose
i be the last one standing
The Lord is my tower
 a shield for me
more than enough
no matter where i go oh oh oh
victory is my Name
My praise is stronger
 my joy over flowing
more than a song
 l'm celebrating
 sing a praise to you
 In midst of my enemies
 i will praise
in the midst of my enemies
 i praise i praise
i gonna put on my dancing shoes
 there's no way  that i can loose
i be the last one standing
my name my name
victory is my name
my name*2
goodness and mercy follows me
all my days all my days
up my head , and behind
on the left , on the right
