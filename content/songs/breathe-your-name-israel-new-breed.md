Surround my life
Surround my heart
As I surrender to you
Your love invades
Your love disarms
I'm letting go
This selfish pride
This hidden sin
My brokenness attracts You
You take my tears
I take Your hand
I'm letting go
So I breathe Your name
And I raise my hands
Surrendering all I am to You
Prevailing Grace
Prevailing Love
You won't relent, You have me
You've won the war
You've won my heart
I'm letting go
