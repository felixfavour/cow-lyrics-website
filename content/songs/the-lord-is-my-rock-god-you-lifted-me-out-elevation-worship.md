When the waters rise
My hope is sure
When life falls apart
I stand secure
When my way is dark
Your light breaks through
When I don't feel You near
Your word is true
Jesus Your love surrounds me
You're holding my life
Holding my life
The Lord is my rock
And I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
You're with me
The Lord is my rock
And I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
You're with me
When the waters rise
My hope is sure
When life falls apart
I stand secure
