Am born new
New everyday
A New Creation
By the blood

By my Saviour, Redeemer
It's a New Covenant, in Christ.

I've found a place, I'll love to dwell.
GOD'S children, saved and redeemed.
I'm one of them, holy saints
My new life, my new name, of GOD.

Am born new
New everyday
A New Creation
By the blood

By my Saviour, Redeemer
It's a New Covenant, in Christ.

I overcame, by Jesus Christ
Blood of the lamb, my testimony
I stand in faith, in victory
Justified, Sanctified, in Him

Am born new
New everyday
A New Creation
By the blood

By my Saviour, Redeemer
It's a New Covenant, in Christ.

I have a people. Brothers and sisters
Together we share, the same Spirit
Of Jesus Christ, of our Father
Sons of GOD, Heirs of GOD, in Christ.

Am born new
New everyday
A New Creation
By the blood

By my Saviour, Redeemer
It's a New Covenant, in Christ.
