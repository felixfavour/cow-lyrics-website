[Chorus]
Be the crown
In the light and sound
Be the fire
Burning inside out
Be the love
Casting out all fear
Let Your Name
Rule the atmosphere
Love like the skies are wide
Crashing down to bring the world to life
Hope came dancing on an empty grave
Death has lost its rule to the King of grace
Be the crown
In the light and sound
Be the fire
Burning inside out
Be the love
Casting out all fear
Let Your Name
Rule the atmosphere
