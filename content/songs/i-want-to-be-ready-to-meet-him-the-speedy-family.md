You may have your worldly pleasures
Your silver and your gold
You may pile up all the riches
That this old world can hold
But I'd rather have my Saviour
And with Him firmly stand
For I want to be ready to meet Him
In the glory land

I want to be ready
To meet Him by and by
I want to be ready
To meet Him in the sky
Oh, I want to be more like him
And do his best command
For I want to be ready to meet Him
In the glory land

You can talk about your riches
Your diamonds and your pearls
You may gamble on four aces
Of this and all the world
But the Saviour is more precious
With Him I'll take my stand
For I want to meet Him in the glory land






I want to be ready
To meet Him by and by
I want to be ready
To meet Him in the sky
Oh, I want to be more like him
And do his best command
For I want to be ready to meet Him
In the glory land

There is one thing I can boast of
Salvation from the fall
I'm an heir to wealth in glory
My Father owns it all
That is why I'm shouting happy
And go at His command
For I want to be ready to meet Him
In the glory land

I want to be ready
To meet Him by and by
I want to be ready
To meet Him in the sky
Oh, I want to be more like him
And do his best command
For I want to be ready to meet Him
In the glory land
