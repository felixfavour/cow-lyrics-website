I know he rescued my soul
His blood covered my sin
I believe, i believe
My shame he′s taken away
My pain is healed in his name
I believe, i believe

I'll raise the banner
′Cause my lord has conquered the grave

My Redeemer lives (Repeat 4x) 

You lift my burdens
I'll rise with You
I'm dancing on this mountaintop
To see Your kingdom come
