We are ready for Jericho
And the walls of Jericho
Are coming down
By the Spirit of the Lord
We are marching forward
Till every battle is won
We're the Joshua generation
A chosen and anointed nation
Jericho knows we are coming
And the walls of Jericho
Are coming down
They heard about the plagues in Egypt
And how the people of the Lord were set free
They heard about Pharaoh's army
And how they drowned in the Red Sea
They heard about the cloud that led by day
And the fire in the sky each night
They know that our God is with us
And they know that we know how to fight
We are ready for Jericho
And the walls of Jericho
Are coming down
By the Spirit of the Lord
We are marching forward
Till every battle is won
We're the Joshua generation
A chosen and anointed nation
Jericho knows we are coming
And the walls of Jericho
Are coming down
