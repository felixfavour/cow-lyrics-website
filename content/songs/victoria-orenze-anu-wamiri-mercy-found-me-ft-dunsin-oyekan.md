Thank you Jesus
Anu wamiri o

Anu wamiri o
Your mercy, your mercy call my name
Your mercy, your mercy pull me out
Your mercy, your mercy call my name
It's calling my name everyday
Your mercy, your mercy pull me out
Your mercy, your mercy call my name
Calling my name screaming my name
Your mercy, your mercy pull me out
Your mercy, your mercy call my name
Your mercy, your mercy pull me out
Right there in the midst of nowhere
Your compassion found me, called me home
Right there in the midst of nowhere
Your compassion found me, called me home

Your mercy found me
Your mercy pulled me
Your mercy grabbed me
Your mercy chasing
Your mercy called me
Your mercy yaked me
Your mercy pulled me
Your mercy is calling my name
Your mercy called me
Your mercy plucked me
Your mercy pulled me
Your mercy set my feet on the rock to stay
Your mercy placed me
Your mercy blessed me
It's your mercy Jesus
Your mercy said no

Your mercy said no
Mercy has a voice
And it's speaking on my behalf
Your mercy said no
Mercy has a voice o
and it's speaking on my behalf
speaking better things
mercy said no
speaking better things
mercy said no
it's speaking better things
