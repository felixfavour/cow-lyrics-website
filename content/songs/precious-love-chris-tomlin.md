There is forgiveness flowing down
From where the savior died
The son of man upon the tree
Exchanging death for life
[Pre-Chorus]
See Him there in innocence
The body and the blood
Behold the King, crucified
Spotless lamb of God
Oh, the precious love of Jesus
Oh, the fount of grace divine
Flowing as a mighty river
Washing sinners in its tide
There will never be another
In whose name we are redeemed
Oh, the precious love of Jesus
Pouring out for you and me
Sin and death crushed underneath
The weight of nailed pierced hands
He plundered hell and tore the veil
As creation held its breath
