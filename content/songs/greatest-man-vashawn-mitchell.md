Jesus is the greatest man I know
Jesus is the greatest man I know
Made the moon, stars, the land, and sea
Redemptive man of authority
Jesus is the greatest man I know
Jesus is the worthy Lamb of God
Jesus is the worthy Lamb of God
That is why we bow before Your throne
Knowing You are God alone
Jesus is the greatest man I know
Oh... He's the greatest man I know
Oh... He's the greatest man I know
Oh-oh-oh (oh... oh... oh...)
Greatest man I know!
Jesus is the Lamb that was slain
Jesus is the Lamb that was slain
Hung, bled, was crucified
By His own, he was denied
Jesus is the greatest man I know
