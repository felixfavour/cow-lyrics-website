Oh
Ada Mama don come again oh oh
Limoblaze, yo, yo, yo
Nobody go say, nobody go say
Shame on me cause I follow your way
I follow your way, oh
Oh, Adonai, can never lie, as you see me I'm so settled for life
He's too faithful to fail me
Anywhere you send me to, I go-go
If you tell me make I stay, I go stay
Tell who dey wait on my down for
Alaye You don jam gbege
Shey You say no one can say no, when Jesus says yes
His Spirit inside me tells me I'm solid
I call my Daddy
Talk and do, talk and do
And there's no mountain He will not move, He never fails mÐµ
Na him blood dey cover me, Daddy covÐµr me, we unending favour
Even bless my neighbor
Oh Adonai take your glory, your glory
For the many blessings them dey notice and posting
Oh Adonai take your glory, your glory
For the many blessings them dey notice and posting
They posting all over
Cause I like the way you do your things
You no be man oh, Your way supreme
Daddy they don't know, it goes farther than the mind goes
But I will serve you for the rest of my days, I no go take holiday
Na your word dey light up my way, I no go look yesterday
Anywhere you send me to, I go-go
If you tell me make I stay, I go stay
Tell who dey wait on my down for
Alaye You don jam gbege
Shey You say no one can say no, when Jesus says yes
His Spirit inside me, tells me I'm solid
I call my Daddy
Talk and do, talk and do
And there's no mountain He will not move, He never fails me
Na him blood dey cover me, Daddy cover me, we unending favour
Even bless my neighbor
Oh Adonai take your glory, your glory
For the many blessings them dey notice and posting
Oh Adonai take your glory, your glory
For the many blessings them dey notice and posting
I call my Daddy
Talk and do, talk and do
And there's no mountain He will not move, He never fails me
Na him blood dey cover me, Daddy cover me, we unending favour
Even bless my neighbor
