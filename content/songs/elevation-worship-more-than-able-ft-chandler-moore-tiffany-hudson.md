When did I start to forget
All of the great things You did?
When did I throw away faith for the impossible?
How did I start to believe
You weren't sufficient for me?
Why do I talk myself out of seeing miracles?
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Now I see all that I have
And I've got my confidence back
I'll put my trust in the One who still does miracles
You do miracles
You are more than able
You arÐµ more than able
You are morÐµ than able
You are more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Can you imagine with all the faith in the room
What the Lord can do, what the Lord can do
It's gonna happen, just let the Way Maker through
He's gonna move, He's gonna move
Anything is possible
Anything is possible
Anything is possible
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
I've come a long way
I've seen how You work
There's so much goodness and grace
Much more than I deserve
Cause I know who I am
But I can't stay where I'm at
We've come this far by faith
And I just can't turn back
You're not done with me yet
You're not done with me yet
There's so much more to this story
You're not done with me yet
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
