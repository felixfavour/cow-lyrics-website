I believe the promise
About the visions
And the dreams
That the Holy Spirit
Will be poured out
And His power will be seen
Well the time is now
The place is here
And His people have
Come in faith
There's a mighty sound
And a touch of fire
When we're gathered
In one place
I believe that the Presence of God is here
There's not one thing
That can't be changed
When the spirit
Of God is near
I believe that the Presence of God is here
When two or three are gathered
When people rise in faith
I believe God answers
And His presence
Is in this place
