Miracles when You move
such an easy thing for you to do
Your hand is moving right now
You are still showing up
At the tomb of every Lazarus
Your voice is calling me out
And right now, I know You're able
And my God, come through again
You can do all things
You can do all things but fail
'cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will, mmh
Everything's possible
By the power of the Holy Ghost
A new wind is blowing right now (oh yeah)
Breaking my heart of stone
Taking over like its Jericho
And my walls are all crashing down
But right now, I know You're able
And my God, come through again
You can do(c'mon and worship with me tonight) all things, (oh yeah, yeah)
You can do all things but fail
'cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will
.repeat
You've never lost a battle(You've never lost a battle)3x
You never will (You never will)
You've  never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)3x
Never(You never will)
You can do ooh
You can do all things but fail (all things, all things but fail)
You can do all things (You can do all things but fail)
cause You've never lost a battle ( cause You've never lost)
No, You've never lost a battle (You've never lost)
I know (i know) I know (I know)
You never will ( You never will)
   .......repeat
You can do all things, whoa (but fail)
You can do everything else
cause You've never lost a battle
No You've never lost a battle
And I know I know
You never will
I know (I know) I know (I know)
You never will (You never will)
I know (never lost) I know
You never will
yeah eee yeah
Don't have to wait till the battle is over
I can shout now
I don't have to wait till the battle is over
I can shout now
......repeat
