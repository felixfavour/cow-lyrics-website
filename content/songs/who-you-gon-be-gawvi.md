[Chorus: GAWVI]
'Til you let go, 'til you let go
Who you gon' be inside?
Who you gon', who you gon' be?
'Til you let go, 'til you let go
Who you gon' be inside?
Who you gon', who you gon' be?
'Til you let go, 'til you let go
Who you gon' be inside?
Who you gon', who you gon' be?
'Til you let go, 'til you let go
Who you gon' be inside?
Who you gon', who you gon' be?
'Til you let go, 'til you let go
Who you gon' be inside?
Who you gon', who you gon' be?
When I let go I'ma live
I cannot let any, uh
I told you I'm born again, gang, gang
Angels around me I'm floatin'
I do not go with the motions
I don't believe in emotions, motions, hmm, oceans
Oceans of grace flowin' on me
I know the Lord workin' on me
I know they tryin' to stop me
But you cannot stop me
You cannot stop me
You cannot
Uh, they got the Dove and I ran with it
I got the Dove and I plan with it
I told the people they can wit' it
I don't let nobody play wit' me
I got the Lord and my gang wit' me
This is the one, ayo, Broward, my city
I do this for Jesus and everyone with me
Yeah, uh, excuse my French but I'm out here in France
I got things but I don't gotta dance
I got plays but I don't gotta act
I got age but I'm still in the lab
I been out here really on gang
I been out here really on gang
All my drums, yeah, they really gon' bang
