O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
O sing all ye citizens
Of Heaven above
Glory to God
O glory in the highest
Christ the Lord
You are the Lord
Yeah Lord, we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus to Thee be all glory
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing
