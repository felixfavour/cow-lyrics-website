Every demon shakes
As we shout Your praise
All the stones have rolled away

You have robbed the grave
So we celebrate
Your eternal victory

Shout oh Zion
Shout in triumph
Death is now a lie

Every demon shakes
As we shout Your praise
All the stones have rolled away

You have robbed the grave
So we celebrate
Your eternal victory

We dance on an empty grave
We dance on an empty grave
You have overcome
You have overcome

We dance on an empty grave
We dance on an empty grave
You have overcome
You have overcome
