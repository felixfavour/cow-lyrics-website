atter
Hands high like the fight gon' let up
There's a victory I already know
Stand back, watch the enemies scatter
Scatter
Your word is my shield
My strength and my health
Its power can close the gates of Hell
Before I hit the front line
You've already gone before
I know that I know the battle is the Lord's
My praise gonna shake these rockers
These walls gonna fall like Jericho
Stand back, watch the enemies scatter
Scatter
Hands high like the fight gon' let up
There's a victory I already know
Stand back, watch the enemies scatter
Scatter
Singin' glory, hallelujah
Glory, hallelujah
Glory, hallelujah
My God is marchin' on
Singin' glory, hallelujah
Glory, hallelujah
Glory, hallelujah
My God is marchin' on
Stand back, watch the enemies scatter
My praise gonna shake these rockers
These walls gonna fall like Jericho
Stand back, watch the enemies scatter
Scatter
Hands high like the fight gon' let up
There's a victory I already know
Stand back, watch the enemies scatter
Scatter
