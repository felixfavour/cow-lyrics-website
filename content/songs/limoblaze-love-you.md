Verse 1
Love
I need you to know i still love you
I need you to know i ain't mad at you
If i need a lid on my love for you
I would do it again
I would die for you
And there's nothing you can do
That will take my love
And my mercy away from you
I hate to see Coz it hurts me
But it doesn't alter
The image i have for you
I know your sin is a nature
But i can not change it
So please would you let me in
I stand at the door of heart
And I'm knocking
I need you to open up
Why won't you open up
I know that you love me
But it's been a battle
And i wanna help you win
So son would you let me in
Let go of the guilt and the shame
And let me in.
I know for sure that you love me
I see you hurt and it hurts me
I wanna take it away
I wanna take all your guilt
And your shame
I wanna lead if you let me
I'll be your strength if  you trust me
I'll be your guide all the time
I'll take your sin
so the wages are mine[?]
My son you know that i love you
There's no creation above you
But see when you trust in your will
You'll always hurt me 2
My son you know that i love you
There's no creation above you
I need you to trust in my will
So you wouldn't hurt me
You wouldn't hurt me
Chorus
Coz i wanna love you
i wanna love you 2
You know i love you 2
I wanna love you
I just wanna love you
So please don't do hurt me
Please don't do hurt me
I just wanna love you 2
You know i love you 3
I wanna love you
You know i love you 2
Please don't do hurt me 2
Please let me love
I wanna love you 2
I love you
Verse 2
I must admit every time that you sin
Is like hanging me back on the cross
I know that they told you
I'll burn you for that
But trust me that message is false
I'll take the nails over and over
For you I'll be back on the cross
Back to the place
Where the father forsook me
I'll lie if say it don't hurt
So please don't do hurt me
I wanna change you
So you can  love me
I stand at the door of your heart
And I'm knocking
I need you to open up
Why won't you open up
I know that you love me
But there's been a battle
And i wanna help you win
So son would you let me in
Let go of the guilt and the shame
And let me in
Chorus.
Coz i wanna love you
I wanna love you
Please let me love you
I wanna love you 2
Please let me love you
You know i love you 3
I wanna love you 3
So please don't do hurt me
Please don't do hurt me 2
You know i love you 2
Please don't do hurt me
I wanna love you 3
Please don't do hurt me
I love you
