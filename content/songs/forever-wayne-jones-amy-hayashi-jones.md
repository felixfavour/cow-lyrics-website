Give thanks to the Lord, our God and king
His love endures forever
For he is good, he is above all things
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
With a mighty hand and outstretched arm
His love endures forever
For the life that's been reborn
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
Sing praise, sing praise
Forever, God is faithful
Forever, God is strong
Forever, God is with us
Forеver, forever, forеver
[Oohing]
From the rising to the setting sun
His love endures forever
And by the grace of God, we will carry on
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
Sing praise, sing praise
