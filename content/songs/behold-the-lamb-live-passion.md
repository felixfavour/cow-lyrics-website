See Him there, the Great I Am
A crown of thorns upon His head
The Father's heart displayed for us
Oh God, we thank You for the cross
Lifted up on Calvaryâ€™s hill
We cursed Your name and even still
You bore our shame and paid the cost
Oh God, we thank You for the cross
Behold the Lamb, the story of redemption
Written on His hands
Jesus, You will reign forevermore
The victory is Yours
We sing Your praise
Endless hallelujahs to Your holy name
Jesus, You will reign forevermore
The victory is Yours
Offer up this sacrifice
For every sin, our Savior died
The Lord of Life can't be contained
Our God has risen from the grave
Oh, our God has risen from the grave, whoa
