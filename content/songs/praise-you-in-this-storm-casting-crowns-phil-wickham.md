I was sure by now
God, You would have reached down
And wiped our tears away
Stepped in and saved the day
But once again, I say, "Amen" and it's still raining
[Pre-Chorus]
And as the thunder rolls
I barely hear Your whisper through the rain
"I'm with you"And as Your mercy falls
I'll lift my hands and praise the God who gives
And takes away
So I'll praise You in this storm
I will lift my hands
For You are who You are
No matter where I am
And every tear I've cried
You hold in Your hand
You never left my side
And though my heart is torn
I will praise You in this storm
