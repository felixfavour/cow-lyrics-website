Water You turned into wine
Opened the eyes of the blind, 
There's no one like You
None like You 

Into the darkness, You shine 
Out of the ashes, we rise
There's no one like You
There's none like You

Our God is greater 
Our God is stronger 
God, You are higher than any other 
Our God is healer 
Awesome in power, our God 
Our God 

And if our God is for us 
Then who could ever stop us? 
And if our God is with us 
Then what can stand against? 

There's no God like Jehovah
There's no God like Jehovah

How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God 
And all will see how great
How great is Our God

You're the name above all name
You are worthy of our praise 
And my heart will sing how great is God

He really is a great God 
He really is a great God
