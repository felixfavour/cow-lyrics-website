I need you here
Youre like the rain that falls
Fall on this heart and make me new
I look to you
Youre king above the earth
And you have put heaven in my heart
I only want to be where You are
Holy, Holy is the lord
King of glory
Forever Savior the world
Though the mountains may be moved
And fall in to the raging sea
Youll never let me fall
You hold me in your nail-scarred hands
