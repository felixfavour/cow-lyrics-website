Why do I do things I hate?
Why do I say things that I shouldn't say?
When I know better, yeah
I could love better
Some days I take it too far
Sometimes the world gets the best of my heart
I know who I am (I know who I am)
'Til I forget just who I am
When I find myself again
Standing knee-deep in my sin
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin & RaeLynn, 
RaeLynn
]
You chase me down when I don't deserve it
You show me love, You don't make me earn it
I make a mess and I just start running
Hoping that You won't know
Oh
, when I'm lost and I'm low
In a place that I think You won't go
You chase me down
You chase me down
Sometimes I can't believe
You stay when You don't have to 'cause You won't leave
Whatever that looks like, yeah (Whatever that looks like)
That's what love looks like
