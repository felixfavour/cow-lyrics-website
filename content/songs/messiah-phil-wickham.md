Look, the road is narrow and hard to find
With secret battles inside our minds, who can last?
[Pre-Chorus]
God, we need Your strength to find
Your light to guide us through the night
You're our only chance
Messiah, Messiah
Messiah, save us
Run, I wanna run to Your open hand
But Father, I can barely stand on my own
[Pre-Chorus]
Now, like the Children of Abraham
We're reaching out for the Promised Land for our home
Messiah, Messiah
Messiah, save us
Messiah, Messiah
Messiah, save us
