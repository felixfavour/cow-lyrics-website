In the morning when I rise to meet You
In the morning when I lift my eyes
You're the gentle light that falls around me
Youâ€™re the first thought on my mind
And let our voices rise
All creation cries
Singing out an endless alleluia
From this moment on
Join with heaven's song
Singing out an endless alleluia, alleluia
In the moments where You go unnoticed
In the ordinary day to day
Countless miracles of life around us
Point like arrows to Your name
And let our voices rise
All creation cries
Singing out an endless alleluia
From this moment on
Join with heaven's song
Singing out an endless alleluia, alleluia
We join the song of heaven today, ayy!
