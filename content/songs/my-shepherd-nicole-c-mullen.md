The Lord is my Shepherd
And I shall not want
I shall not want
I shall not lack
I shall not do without any good thing
I shall not want
I shall not lack
I shall not do without any good thing
He makes me to lie down
In Green Pastures
He leads me besides the still waters
He makes me to lie down
In Green Pastures
He leads me besides the still waters
I shall not want
I shall not lack
I shall not do without any good thing
I shall not want
I shall not lack
I shall not do without any good thing
So who?
... Can stand against us?
