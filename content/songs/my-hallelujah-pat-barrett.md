Open up the doors again
Let the King of glory in
His Kingdom will never end
Oh, I know that You are good
Break the darkness with the light
All the earth, let praise arise
Every dead place, come alive
Oh, I know that You are good
Oh, I know that You are good
You will have my hallelujah
You alone the highest name
All to You, I surrender
Every breath I take
Make my life Your grace
Oh, Spirit of the living God
Fire burning in my heart
I'm wide awake to who You are
Oh, I know that You are good
Oh, I know that You are good
