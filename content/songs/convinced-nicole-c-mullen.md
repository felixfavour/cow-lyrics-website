I don't know if light is brighter
In the earth or the soul
I don't know which night is darker
The one I do or don't know
But I'm convinced
I'm persuaded
I will not be separated
From the love
I have in You
'Cause neither death or life can severe
Neither height or depth could measure the love You have
And my love for You
The wind will blow on everybody
And rain will fall on us all
And if the, weather of my life
Is not like I want it, still
I'll survive thru the storm
'Cause I'm convinced
I'm persuaded
I will not be separated
From the love
I have in You
'Cause neither death or life can severe
Neither height or depth could measure the love You have
