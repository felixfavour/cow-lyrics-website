There is no shadow
That has ever overcome Your light
And there is no rival
That could ever stand against Your might
You've always been with us
Every battle You've already won
Oh, we've already won
There is no weapon
That has ever left a mark on You
And there is no army
With the power to conquer truth
You've always been with us
Every battle, You've already won
We've already won
Show me one thing He can't do
Show me a mountain He can't move
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible
Show me one thing that's too hard
Show me waters He can't part
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible
Is possible
There is a kingdom
That's advancing at the speed of light
And in His kingdom
Every dead thing is bound to rise
Oh God, our redeemer
He is faithful to revive
Oh, He will revive
Show me one thing He can't do
Show me a mountain He can't move
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible
Do you believe it?
Show me one thing that's too hard
Show me waters He can't part
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible
Now, all of my fear
I will turn into praise
Shake off despair
As I sing out Your name
A victory dance
I will dance loud in faith
I will crush disappointment
And break every chain
Oh, all of my fear
I will turn into praise
Shake off despair
As I sing out Your name
A victory dance
I will dance loud in faith
I will crush disappointment
And break every chain
Oh, all of my fear
I will turn into praise
Shake off despair
As I sing out Your name
A victory dance
I will dance loud in faith
I will crush disappointment
Show me one thing He can't do
Show me a mountain He can't move
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible
Yes, He is
Show me one thing that's too hard
Show me waters He can't part
He's the God of the breakthrough
And anything is possible
[?] real
Anything is possible
Anything is possible
[?]
Shout out to God with a voice of triumph
