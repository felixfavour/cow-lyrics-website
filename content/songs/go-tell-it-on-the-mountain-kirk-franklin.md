[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Listen, I hope you don't mind this holiday season
If we take it back just a minute here
'Cause I know some people are getting excited about material things
But I wish I could get a church in here, uh-huh
That knows that Jesus is the reason for the season
Can I get one witness in here?
Said, can I get one witness in here?
Here we go, say it
Sing, mother
[Chorus: Female Lead]
Go tell it on the mounâ€”, mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
Go, go tell it on the mountain
That, that Jesus Christ is born (Go girl)
[Bridge: Female Lead, 
Choir
]
I want you to go (
Tell it, He's up here
)
I want you to go (
Tell it, He's our Savior, and Master
)
Oh, go (
Tell it, He's a deliverer
)
Oh, go (
Go

Tell 'em that Jesus
(
That Jesus Christ is born
)
Born, tell 'em that Jesus
(
That Jesus Christ is born

Born, born (
Go, tell it

Go, tell it (
Go tell it

All about the Lord (

You oughta go tell it (

Born in a manger (
Tell it

Come on in here
Go tell it (

All about the Lord, tell it (
