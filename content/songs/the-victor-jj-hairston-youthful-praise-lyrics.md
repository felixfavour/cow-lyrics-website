Lord, we worship You (Lord, we worship You)
We lift our voice to (You We lift our voice to You)
For You are our King (For You are our King)
Our triumphant King (Our triumphant King)

Power and victory (Power and victory)
Shall always be with me (Shall always be with me)
For you are mighty (yeah!)
Mighty in battle (yeah!)
There's no one greater than you!

Lord You are our champion,
There's not one battle you haven't won.
You will always be victorious forever.
Lord You are our champion,
Won't be defeated, it can't been done.
In every battle, in every war,
You are the victor!

You reign (You Reign)
You reign in victory (You reign in victory)
I am so glad (I am so glad)
That you fight for me (That you fight for me)
[x3]

Lord You are our champion,
There's not one battle you haven't won.
You will always be victorious forever.
Lord You are our champion,
Won't be defeated, it can't been done.
In every battle, in every war,
You are the victor!

No Failure in you (No Failure in you)
No Defeat in you (No Defeat in you)
You always win (You always win)
You always win (You always win)
[x4]
