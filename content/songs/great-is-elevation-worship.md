It was lonely in the dark
But you were working
It was painful
It was hard
But you were working
All things for my good
Couldn't feel you
At the time
But you were working
Full of questions
Wondering why
But you were working
All things for my good
When I look back over my life
And I think how good you have been
My soul sings
Great is
Great is your faithfulness
When I get your love on my mind
I get grateful all over again
And my soul sings
Great is
Great is your faithfulness
