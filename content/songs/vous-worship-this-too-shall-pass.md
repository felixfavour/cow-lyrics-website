What is your life This gift of time It's all but a vapor Dust in the wind Verse 2 Like flowers fade And waste away This life always changes But one thing I know Chorus This too shall pass No failure is final The wins don't define you None of it lasts The best is ahead When all this is finished It's just the beginning Love never ends This too shall pass Verse 3 So I fix my eyes On the one who guides Through heartbreak and failure The joy and the pain Chorus This too shall pass No failure is final The wins don't define you None of it lasts The best is ahead When all this is finished It's just the beginning Love never ends Chorus This too shall pass No failure is final The wins don't define you None of it lasts The best is ahead When all this is finished It's just the beginning Love never ends This too shall pass Bridge And it's not too late To begin again Cause in everything He is working for good If it's not okay Then it's not the end Just hold on He will carry you through Chorus This too shall pass No failure is final The wins don't define you None of it lasts The best is ahead When all this is finished It's just the beginning Love never ends Chorus This ()too shall pass No failure is final The wins don't define you None of it lasts The best is ahead When all this is finished It's just the beginning Love never ends Bridge And it's not too late To begin again Cause in everything He is working for good If it's not okay Then it's not the end Just hold on He will carry you through
