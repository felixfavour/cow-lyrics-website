Glory
I stand in reverence of Your glory
Words fail to capture all You’ve shown me
I’ll ever sing my love for You
I’ve tasted
I’ll tell the world of what I tasted
Your goodness towards me won’t be wasted
I’ll ever sing my love for You
Oh oh oh oh
Oh my God look what You’ve done
Oh oh oh oh
Oh my God look what You’ve done
Holy
I cry with angels You are holy
Your grace towards me makes me worthy
I’ll ever sing my love for You
You make the mountains crumble
Silence the roaring thunder
You are the God of wonders
Oh my God
You calm the ocean’s waves
Snatch power from the grave
You’re always making ways
Oh my God
