I've had disappointments, and so have you
I remember times when times were bad
But I am so glad for every moment
That I spent in His hand, in His hand
In His hand, there's only safety
Nothing there can touch you except Him
Bring your burdens and all your failures
Lay them down and rest here in His hand
I will have more problems, and so will you
But through every one, we all can stand
If we're in His hand, so are the trials
There is no cause for fear in His hand
In His hand, there's only safety
Nothing there can touch you except Him
Bring your burdens and all your failures
Lay them down and rest here in His hand
In His hand, there's only safety
Nothing there can touch you except Him
Bring your burdens and all your failures
Lay them down and rest here in His hand...
