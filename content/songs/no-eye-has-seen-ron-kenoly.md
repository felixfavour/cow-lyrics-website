Our God is faithful and his love never fails
There is no end to his favour
Our God is able and his mercy prevails
His love and kindness last forever
He's healed our bodies
He's restoring our souls
He's put his righteousness within us
We've got the power of the Holy Ghost
We've got the mighty name of Jesus
No eye has seen
No ear has heard
No mind has conceived
What God has prepared for those who love him
No eye has seen
No ear has heard
What God has in store for us
No eye has seen
No ear has heard
No mind has conceived
What God has prepared for those who love him
No eye has seen
No ear has heard
What God has in store for us
