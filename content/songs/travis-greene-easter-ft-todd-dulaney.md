So many charges
I was in debt over my head
Couldn't afford it
But someone paid for it instead
It took a while to recognize
That what I owe did not exist no more
What I could not pay
He handled for me
He took the bill and the receipt
It's signed in blood (Blood, blood)
An outstanding balance (Oh my God)
That I could not rectify, all out of options
But you settled just in time (Hey)
I couldn't understand how
What I owe did not exist anymore
What I could not pay
He handled for me
He took the bill and the receipt
It's signed in blood
He paid it all, all to Jesus I Owe (Oh)
Sin left a stain (Stain)
He ashed it as snow
When I could not pay
He covered for it, Hallelujah
To the one who paid it all
He paid it all, all to Jesus I owe
Sin left a stain
He washed it as snow
When I could not pay
He covered for it, Hallelujah
To the one who paid it all
Oh, no, no, oh, no, no, oh, no, no
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We declare it all
Our god who risen, risen from the grave, oh
So we sing
On the cross, debt was paid
In the tomb, his body laid (Oh)
Darkness ruled 'till light appeared
He rolled the stone (Yeah)
He silenced fear, oh, death (Oh)
Look at who's laughing now
Oh grave, the Savior's walking out
With wisdom, power, with truth and grace
All hail the King of Heaven Reigns
He paid it all, all to Jesus I Owe (Oh)
Sin left a stain (Stain)
He ashed it as snow
When I could not pay
He covered for it, Hallelujah
To the one who paid it all
On the cross, debt was paid
In the tomb, his body laid (Oh)
Darkness ruled 'till light appeared
He rolled the stone (Yeah)
He silenced fear, oh, death (Oh)
Look at who's laughing now
Oh grave, the Savior's walking out
With wisdom, power, with truth and grace
All hail the King of Heaven Reigns
(He did it for me, did it all)
Hele, hele, hele, hele
