(Intro)
All my life you have always been there
To bring me through somehow
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
All my life you have always been there
So please don't leave me now
Ooh ooh ooh (That's all I'm asking Lord)
(Chorus)
All my life you have always been there
To bring me through somehow
All my life you have always been there
Please don't leave me now
I'm lost for words... right now I'm gonna try
To articulate what I'm feeling inside
See I never won't let to make you feel bad
You're the closet friend that I've ever had
(Chorus)
All I'm asking Lord
Don't leave me now
Wait a minute, don't leave me now
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
