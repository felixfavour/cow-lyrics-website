d Lord, You are more costly than gold
Lord, You are more beautiful than diamonds
And nothing I desire compares with You
Lord, You are more precious than silver
And Lord, You are more costly than gold
Lord, You are more beautiful than diamonds
And nothing I desire compares with You
Oh, who can weigh the volume of knowing You
And who could charge the worth of who You are?
Oh, who can count the blessing of loving You
And who could say just how great You are?
Oh, who can weigh the volume of knowing You
And who can charge the worth of who You are?
Oh, who could count the blessing of loving You
And who could say just how great You are?
Oh, who could say just how great You are?
Lord, You are more precious than silver
And Lord, You are more costly than gold
Lord, You are more beautiful than diamonds
And nothing I desire compares with You
