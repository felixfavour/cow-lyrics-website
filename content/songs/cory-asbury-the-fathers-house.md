Sometimes on this journey
I get lost in my mistakes
What looks to me like weakness
Is a canvas for your strength
And my story isn't over
My story's just begun
And failure won't define me
'Cause that's what my Father does
Yeah, failure won't define me
'Cause that's what my Father does
Ooh, lay your burdens down
Ooh, here in the Father's house
Check your shame at the door
'Cause it ain't welcome anymore
Ooh, you're in the Father's house
Arrival's not the end game
The journey's where you are
You never wanted perfect
You just wanted my heart
And the story isn't over
If the story isn't good
And failure's never final
When the Father's in the room
And failure's never final
When the Father's in the room
Ooh, lay your burdens down
Ooh, here in the Father's house
Check your shame at the door
'Cause it ain't welcome anymore
Ooh, you're in the Father's house
Yeah, you're in the Father's house
Yeah-yeah
Prodigals come home
The helpless find hope
Love is on the move
When the Father's in the room
Prison doors fling wide
The dead come to life
Love is on the move
When the Father's in the room
Miracles take place
The cynical find faith
And love is breaking through
When the Father's in the room
The Jericho walls are quaking
Strongholds now are shaking
Love is breaking through
When the Father's in the room
I said, love is breaking through
When the Father's in the room
Ooh, lay your burdens down
Ooh, here in the Father's house
Check your shame at the door
'Cause it ain't welcome anymore
Ooh, you're in the Father's house
Yeah, lay your burdens down
Ooh, here in the Father's house
Check your shame at the door
(Welcome anymore)
Ooh, you're in the Father's house
