We've seen what You can do, oh, God of wonders
Your power has no end
The things You've done before, in greater measure
You will do again
[Pre-Chorus:  Brian Johnson]
'Cause there's no prison wall You can't break through
No mountain You can't move, all things are possible
There's no broken body You can't raise
No soul that You can't save, all things are possible
[Chorus: Brian Johnson]
The darkest night
You can light it up
You can light it up
God of revival
Let hope arise
Death is overcome
You've already won
God of revival
You rose in victory and now You're seated
Forever on the throne
So why should my heart fear what You've defeated?
I will trust in You alone
