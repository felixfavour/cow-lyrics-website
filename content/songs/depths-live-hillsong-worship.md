In Your presence, I quiet my soul
And I hear Your voice
In my spirit, I hear the sound
Of Salvation's son
Jesus, Jesus
I will wait in Your word, oh Lord
There Your spirit speaks
Bringing life to the weary soul
To the depths of me
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
[Instrumental]
[Bridge 1]
I love You with all my heart
I love You with all my soul, Lord
I love You with all my strength
With all that is within me
I love You with all my heart
I love You with all my soul, Lord
I love You with all my strength
With all that is within me
