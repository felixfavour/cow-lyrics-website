Donald Lawrence speaking:
He leads me beside still waters
He restoreth my soul
When you become a believer
Your spirit is made right
But sometimes, the soul doesn't get the notice
It has a hole in it
Due to things that's happened in the past:
Hurt, abuse, molestation
But we wanna speak to you today and tell you
That God wants to heal the hole in your soul
Some people's action are not because their spirit is wrong
But its because the past has left a hole in their soul
May this wisdom help you get over your past
And remind you that God wants to heal the hole in your soul
I have my sister Le'Andria here, she gone help me share this wisdom
And tell this story
Le'Andria Johnson:
Lord, deliver me
'Cause all I seem to do is hurt me
Hurt me!
Lord, deliver me
'Cause all I seem to do is hurt me (
Yessuh!
)
Hurt me!
