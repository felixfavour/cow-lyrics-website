Our scars are a sign
Of grace in our lives
And Father, how You brought us through
When deep were the wounds
And dark was the night
The promise of Your love, You proved
Now every battle still to come
Let this be our song
It is well (it is well)
With my soul (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul
Weeping may come, remain for a night
But joy will paint the morning sky
You're there in the fast
You're there in the feast
Your faithfulness will always shine
Now every blessing still to come
Let this be our song
It is well (it is well)
With my soul (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul
You lead us through battles (You lead us through battles)
You lead us to blessing (You lead us to blessing)
And You make us fruitful (You make us fruitful)
In the land of our suffering, God
And it is well, it is well with my soul
It is well (it is well)
With my soul (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul
I trust Your ways (I trust Your ways)
I trust Your name (I trust Your name)
And it is well, it is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul, my soul
