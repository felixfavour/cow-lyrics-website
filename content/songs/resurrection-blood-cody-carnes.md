I was a dead man walking on a dead-end road
Just a soul free falling with no place to go
I heard Jesus knocking and He called me home
Now His Spirit's living deep inside these bones
I've got resurrection blood
Flowing in my veins, flowing in my veins
I found resurrection life
In a hollow grave, in a hollow grave
I see resurrection power
When I speak Your name, when I speak Your name
I've got resurrection blood
Flowing in my veins, flowing in my veins
All my chains went falling when He saved my soul
All my fears went running from the Holy Ghost
Hallelujah, all my sins are white as snow
Now my freedom's anchored in that crimson flow
I've got resurrection blood
Flowing in my veins, flowing in my veins
I found resurrection life
In a hollow grave, in a hollow grave
I see resurrection power
When I speak Your name, when I speak Your name
I've got resurrection blood
Flowing in my veins, flowing in my veins
