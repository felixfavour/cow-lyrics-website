(Intro)
There are questions troubling my mind
Many answers leading to more questions
Will we ever get the conclusion?
Eni d'orun bo lo mo o
Everybody seems certain
Of their doctrine and greed
But what if you're wrong?
Eni d'orun bo lo mo o
So where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go, where do we go,  where do we go?
Stand by me, I'm complicated ???
Creeping out in my shoulders
Questions under my heart
Tell me how do I know that
Jesus died on the cross
Tell me why do I suffer?
On most days I can't pray when I make mistakes and I'm sober
There are categories in faith
There's got lot of my best more than
He loves me anyway
Tell me how exactly do I ever run out of grace
They say give me a break
I wonder if I'm the only one or does anybody relate?
There are questions troubling my mind
Many answers leading to more questions
Will we ever get the conclusion?
Eni d'orun bo lo mo o
Everybody seems certain
Of their doctrines and greed
But what if you're wrong?
Eni d'orun bo lo mo o
So where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go, where do we go,  where do we go?
I'm just thinking, do I got to pay tithe?
Heaven knows that I'd rather give but doesn't make it alright
See there's so many religions who don't recognise Christ
Tell me where do they go
Coz everybody go die
There's just our lines and their lines and steady branding inside
How do we reach doctors
We gat the power, yeah
Why do we live like we don't got the power
Coz we should be healing the sick
Even the least of us, the least of us
Not of the world, not of the world
But I got a question for the life
Why do we learn to put up a ??? impression
So many doctrines, everybody is sure
Everybody is right but could everybody be wrong?
So where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go, where do we go,  where do we go?
