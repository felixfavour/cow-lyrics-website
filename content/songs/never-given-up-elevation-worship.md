You're love is unending
No matter where I've been
And the depths of Your grace
Covers all my mistakes
It wipes away my sin
You gave yourself for me
To show you adore me
And how precious Your love
Covers all that I've done
And still Your pursuing
Chorus:
You have never given up
Never given up
You run to me
You have never given up
Never given up
You catch me
Chorus
