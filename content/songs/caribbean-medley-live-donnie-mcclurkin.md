I've got my mind made up and I won't turn back
Because I want to see my Jesus someday
I've got my mind made up and I won't turn back
Because I want to see my Jesus someday
Goodbye world
I stay no longer with you
Goodbye pleasures of sin
I stay no longer with you
I've made up my mind to go
God's way the rest of my life
I've made up my mind to go
God's way the rest of my life
Born, born, born again Thank God
I'm born again
Born, born, born again Thank God
I'm born again
Born of the water
Spirit and the blood
Thank God, I'm born again
Born of the water
Spirit and the blood
Thank God
I'm born again
