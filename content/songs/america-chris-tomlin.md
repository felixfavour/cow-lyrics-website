Let your glory fly
Let your glory fly
Let your glory fly
If my people will humbly pray
Turn from sin and their wicked ways
And I will hear them and heal their land
And show My glory and power again, yeah
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Lift your eyes up
Look to the sky
The Lord is coming
Coming to America
Can you feel the fire?
Can you see the wind?
It's blowing through
Coming to America again
Go and tell them the blind will see
The lame will walk and the slave is free
Shout the news that the lost are saved
In the name of Jesus, the dead are raised
