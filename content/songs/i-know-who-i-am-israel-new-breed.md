[Chorus]
I know who I am
I know who I am
I know who I am
I am Yours, I am Yours
I know who I am
I know who I am
I know who I am
I am Yours, I am Yours
[Post-Chorus]
And You are mine
Jesus, You are mine
You are mine
Jesus, You are mine
I was running and You found me
I was blinded and You gave me sight
You put a song of praise in me, ooh
I was broken and You healed me
I was dying and You gave me life
Lord, You are my identity
[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know, I know
