I wonder why they  look at me strange.
 like i dont belong on this road
I'm trying to figure out if I will stay
cos I don't feel welcomed here
I know I'm not dressed like every one else
and  I don't own a pair of shoes
But I'm here because I needed some help
I'm starting to think that I made a bad move
but if they give me a chance i only want to make it to the alter to see the man
that's why I came today to change my ways
and I am not ashamed but they are pushing me away
yeah
oh oh oh
I heard the church was a place to come find my healing
but somehow I cant see how ???
everyone seems to be so uneasy
maybe it's the way I look at ???
if they give me the chance I only want to make it to the alter to see the man
that's why I came today to change my ways
and I am not ashamed
I don't care what they think of me
cos I'm where I belong
right now I wanna be set free and find my heart ???
if they give the chance I only want to
 make it to the alter to see the man that's why I came today to change my ways
and I am not ashamed
