We don’t always see eye to eye
And I’ve been asking for quite some time
Why does that cause such a big divide
Why oh why
All accusations
But no conversations, oh
Way too busy
Burning down bridges
Forgot how to build  ‘em  oh
Lord bring us back to this
You bless, You bless our togetherness
Pour out Your Spirit upon all flesh
We’ve come, we’ve come for nothing less
You bless, You bless our togetherness
We’re different in more than a million ways
Beautiful colors that bleed the same
A long way to go but we’re on our way
We’re on our way
Brothers and sisters
In need of forgiveness, oh
Lead us back to Holy religion
Bring death to division
We’re ready to listen
Lord bring us back to this
