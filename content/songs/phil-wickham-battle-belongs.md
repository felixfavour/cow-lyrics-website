When all I see is the battle,
 You see my victory
When all I see is the mountain,
 You see a mountain moved
And as I walk through the shadow,
 Your love surrounds me
There's nothing to fear now
 for I am safe with You
So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
And every fear I lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
And if You are for me,
who can be against me?
Yeah
For Jesus, there's nothing impossible for You
When all I see are the ashes,
You see the beauty
Thank You God
When all I see is a cross,
God,
You see the empty tomb
So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
And every fear I lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
Almighty fortress,
 You go before us
Nothing can stand against the power of our God
You shine in the shadow,
You win every battle
Nothing can stand against the power of our God
An almighty fortress,
You go before us
Nothing can stand against the power of our God
You shine in the shadow, You win every battleWhen all I see is the battle, You see my victory
