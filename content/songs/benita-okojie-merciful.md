You are merciful
Jesus, you are merciful to me
How I love to worship your name
You are merciful
Jesus, you are merciful to me
Oh, how I love to worship your name
I'm standing here
A product of your mercy
Yours have found me as I am
And made me whole again
There were times I strayed away
But your love came and saved me
How would I ever repay you
(Chorus) For everything that you've done?
