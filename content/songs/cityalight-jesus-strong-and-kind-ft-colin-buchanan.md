Jesus said
That if I thirst
I should come to him
No one else can satisfy
I should come to him
Jesus said
If I am weak
I should come to him
No one else can be my strength
I should come to him
For the Lord is good and faithful
He will keep us day and night
We can always run to Jesus
Jesus, strong and kind
Jesus said
That if I fear
I should come to him
No one else can be my shield
I should come to him
For the Lord is good and faithful
He will keep us day and night
We can always run to Jesus
Jesus, strong and kind
Jesus said if I am lost
He will come to me
And he showed me on that cross
He will come to me
For the Lord is good and faithful
He will keep us day and night
We can always run to Jesus
Jesus, strong and kind
