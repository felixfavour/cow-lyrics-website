What can I say of Your love that has not already been said?
Were I to tell all the things You have done I would run out of breath
So many songs have been sung
But how could I praise You enough?
So here's another one
[Chorus: Valley Boys]
Why-y-y-y You love me
Like You love me, I'll never know
Why-y-y-y You love me
Like You love me
Your love is better than silver, better than gold
Better than anything I've ever known, I'll never know
Why-y-y-y You love mе
Like You love me, I'll nеver know
Real joy doesn't always feel like laughter, no
Blessings don't always come from the places I thought they would
Your love doesn't look anything like 
it does in Hollywood
You don't walk out when it's over
That's when I need You the most
I'll never know
[Chorus: Valley Boys]
Why-y-y-y You love me
Like You love me, I'll never know
Why-y-y-y You love me
Like You love me
Your love is better than silver, better than gold
Better than anything I've ever known, I'll never know
Why-y-y-y You love me
Like You love me, I'll never know
