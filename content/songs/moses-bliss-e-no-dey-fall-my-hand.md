I've been don Waka tire
I go from place to place
I go from pillar to post
Nobody Fi change my life
from North to south
I Waka up and down
no food to chop
no clothes to wear
But since you came into my life my world has turn around
now I realize Baba God no dey sleep
I sing this song of victory
I lift my hands in praise
now I testify baba God no dey sleep
eeh E no dey sleep E no dey slumber
As a matter of fact baba God no dey fall my hand oo
He remains the same yesterday and forever
as a matter of fact baba God no dey Fall my hand2
