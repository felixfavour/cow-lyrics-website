All things are working for my good
Cos He's Intentional
Never failing
I know that all things are working for my good
He's Intentional
Never failing
(All things are working) All things are working for my good
(Cos He's Intentional) He's Intentional
(And He's never failing) never failing
(All things are working for my good) All things are working for my good
(He's Intentional) He's Intentional
(He's never failing) never failing
(All things are working) All things are working for my good,
I know that All things are working for my good
All things are working for my good
I know that All things are working for my good
All things are working for my good
All things are working for my good
All things are working for my good
[repeated]
Alright, hands up
Sing
Oh oh oh...
We can smile cos we know it's working
Through the hurt and the pain
I know it's working for my good
I know it's working for my good
This what what
I don't have to worry cos
It's working for me
It's working for me
And I believe it's working for me
I can smile again
I don't have to worry cos
It's working for me
It's working for me
It's working for me
