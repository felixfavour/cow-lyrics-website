You hold my hand (You hold my hand)
I don't have to be afraid, no (You hold my hand)
I don't have to be afraid, no (You hold my hand)
I don't have to be afraid (You hold my hand)
You hold my hand (You hold my hand)
You hold my hand (You hold my hand)
I'm so in love with You (You hold my hand)
I'm so in love with You (You hold my hand)
You hold my hand (You hold my hand)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh (You hold my hand)
You hold my hand (You hold my hand)
You hold my hand (You hold my hand)
You know my name
You know my name
You know my name
You know my name
And oh, how You walk with me
And oh, how You talk with me
Oh, how You tell me
That I am Your own
