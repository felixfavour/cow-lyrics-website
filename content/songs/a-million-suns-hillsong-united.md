You stand eternal
The uncreated One
Who knows no end
The starry wonders
The vast expanses
Bound to Your command
You shine like a million suns ablaze
Wrapped in eternal light and praise
Jesus the First, the Last
The Bright, the Morning Star
You spoke creation
Into existence
Life and all we are
Beyond all measure
The universe
An echo of Your power
You shine like a million suns ablaze
Wrapped in eternal light and praise
Jesus the First, the Last
The Bright, the Morning Star
