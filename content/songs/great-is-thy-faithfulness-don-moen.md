Faithful You are faithful
King of kings Lord of lords
You are faithful
Faithful You are faithful
King of kings Lord of lords
I worship You
Great is Thy faithfulness O God my Father
There is no shadow of turning with Thee
Thou changest not
Thy compassions they fail not
As Thou has been and Thou forever will be
Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness
Morning by morning new mercies I see
All I have needed
Thy hand had provided
Great is Thy faithfulness Lord unto me
Summer and winter sprongtime and harvest
Sun moon and stars in ther courses above
Join with all nature in manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness mercy and love
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
Thine own dear presence
To cheer and to guide
Streng for today
And bright hope for tomorrow
Blessings all time
With ten thousand beside
