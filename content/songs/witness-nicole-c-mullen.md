Can I get a witness?
Ah- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can you get with this?
Ah- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lookin' for some ladies and some young men
To run the race and endure it to the very end
No turning back, no quitting if you're gonna win
On your mark, get set, running like a champion
Have you heard the story about Joshua?
He was young, strong, and courageous
Not by power, nor was it by might my friend
"But by my Spirit," that's what the Lord says
Witness? ah-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can you get with this? ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can I get a witness?
Ah- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can you get with this?
Ah- yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
