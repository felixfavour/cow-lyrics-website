Well, I've been a soldier in God's mighty army Since many long years ago And I've been scarred and wounded in battle And many times I've been brought low But by the signs of the times I then realize I've only one more mile to go Well is that the lights of Heaven up above I feel like running my last mile home.

Oh yes I feel like running my last mile home I see a great band of angels around God's throne Oh what a great celebration as ages roll on I feel like running my last mile home.

Now Jesus said when He reached down to save me I'll go with you all the way So I stepped out on His precious promise And it filled me both night and day I know it's been many years
But I still can feel His spirit moving in my soul Oh it gives me just a taste of what lies ahead I feel like running my last mile home

Oh yes I feel like running my last mile home I see a great band of angels around God's throne Oh what a great celebration as ages roll on I feel like running my last mile home.
