How many times, do I go against Your will
Then You forgive me, but yet I still
Turn around and do the things, the things I shouldn't do
Cause I belong to You and I know You will come through
Lord I know, I take advantage of Your grace
Here in this Christian race
But yet I still hear You calling my name
How many times, would it take for me to learn
That it's only in Your will, I'll ever earn
I'll ever earn my life's reward, the honor due to me
Life eternally, riches in Glory
Lord, I know, I know I don't belong
With You cause I've done wrong
But yet I still hear You calling my name
How many times, do I go against Your will
Then You forgive me, but yet I still
Turn around and do the things, the things I shouldn't do
Cause I belong to You and I know You will come through
Lord, I know, I know I don't belong
With You cause I've done wrong
But yet I still hear You calling my name
You're calling my name to come into Your arms
To be safe from fear and harm
Knowing this but I still choose to go my way
And You still say, You say that I am He
Who will supply your every need
Oh Lord I sinned but You're still calling my name
