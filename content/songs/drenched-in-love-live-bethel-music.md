[Intro: Daniel Bashta]
Oh precious
We're singing
[Chorus: Daniel Bashta]
Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
All souls atoned, by the blood of the Lamb
Iâ€™m not a slave to what, once held me damned
How beautiful, that cleansing flood
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
[Chorus: Daniel Bashta & Harvest]
We're singing
Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ohh
