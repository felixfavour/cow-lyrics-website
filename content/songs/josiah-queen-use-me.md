read you used loaves and bread
Raise the dead with what you said
So I know that's what you do
I've seen you use men like me
To free the slaves and part the seas
So I know that's what you do
You make weak things strong
You give bones their flesh
Oh I believe you can use me
You make poor men rich
And give dead men breathe
Oh I believe you can use me
When tragedy is all I see
Drowning in anxiety
I'll trust it's in Your hands
A pain so real it moves my feet
My soul sings a melody
I trust it's in Your hands
You make weak things strong
You give bones their flesh
Oh I believe you can use me
You make poor men rich
And give dead men breathe
Oh I believe you can use me
Just like Moses
Just like Peter
Just like David
And Elijah
Just like my Momma
And my Father
You can use them, You can use me
Just like my Pastor
Sunday school Teacher
Front door Greeter
Student Leader
Just like the missionary, or t he one who cleans the sanctuary
If you can use them, you can use me.
You make weak things strong
You give bones their flesh
Oh I believe you can use me
You make poor men rich
And give dead men breathe
Oh I believe you can use me
Oh I believe you can use me
Oh I believe you can use me
