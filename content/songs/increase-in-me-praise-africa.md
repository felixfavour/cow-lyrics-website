One Lord, One Faith, we stand together
One God and Father of us all
In unity and by God’s Spirit
We walk us one to reach our goal
Increase in me, the flame that’s burning
Ignite in us, Your passion for the lost
Enlarge our hearts, the harvest is here
Oh Lord, Increase in me
To reach the lost is our commission
To stretch our hands to those in need
Reflect God’s Heart, fulfill His calling
And then His Kingdom will increase
Enlarge our hearts rise up in faith
Do not hold back do not delay
Enlarge our hearts rise up in faith
From east to west prepare the way
