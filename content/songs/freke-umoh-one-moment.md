One moment in your presence
Is better than a thousand out there
One moment with you Lord
That's all I need (All I need)
All I need (All I need)
All I need (All I need)
One word from the Master
Is better than the flatterings of men
One word from you Lord
That's all I need (All I need)
All I need (All I need)
All I need (All I need)
One touch from you Jesus
Much better than the kiss of my friend
One touch from you Lord
That's all I need (All I need)
All I need (All I need)
All I need (All I need)
The weight of your glory
Is better than the wages of sin
The weight of your glory
That's all I need (All I need)
Put it on me (All I need)
Put it on me (All I need)
If it's not in your presence
If it's not from your hand
If it's not by your spirit
Don't let me have it (Don't let me have it)
Don't let me have it (Don't let me have it)
Choir
If it's not in your presence
If it's not from your hand
If it's not by your spirit
Don't let me have it
Don't let me have it
If it's not in your presence
If it's not from your hand
If it's not by your spirit
Don't let me have it
Don't let me have it
