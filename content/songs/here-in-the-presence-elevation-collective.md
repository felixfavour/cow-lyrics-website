[Bridge 1]
Mercy is falling, falling
Lift up your hands receive it now
Here in the presence of the Lord
Mercy is falling, falling
Lift up your hands receive it now
Here in the presence of the Lord
Here in the presence of the Lord
Here in the presence
[Bridge 2]
I know your past is broken
You can move on it's over now
Here in the presence of the Lord
I know your past is broken
You can move on it's over now
Here in the presence of the Lord
Here in the presence
Here in the presence of the Lord
[Bridge 3]
Tired of running, running
Be still and know He's in control
Here in the presence of the Lord
Pour out your heart before Him
Open your arms He'll hold you now
Here in the presence of the Lord
Here in the presence
Here in the presence of the Lord
Here in the presence of the Lord
Here in the presence!
