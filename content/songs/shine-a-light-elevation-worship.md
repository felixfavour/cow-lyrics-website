Waking up to another life
No more sorrow and no more night
You're the light, let it shine now, let it shine now
Burning bright, 'cause we're not ashamed
Got a world to illuminate
You're the light, let it shine now, let it shine now
Nothing can stand against us
Our praise will break the darkness
We declare, Your kingdom's here
Because our God is for us
We're living in the promise
We declare, Your kingdom's here
Shadows fade as You now arise
Hope is here with no end in sight
You're the light, let it shine now, let it shine now
You're the light, let it shine now, let it shine now
Nothing can stand against us
Our praise will break the darkness
We declare, Your kingdom's here
Because our God is for us
We're living in the promise
We declare, Your kingdom's here
