I knew you were the one
My heart was overcome
The day I looked into your eyes
The feeling so surreal
Like time was standing still
When you said you would be mine
Oh, you are a miracle
You're sweeter than I've ever dreamed
You're so much more than beautiful
How can it be that you belong to me?
So walk with me awhile
And we will spend our lives
Learning the mysteries of love
And through the darkest nights
We'll hold each other tight
I promise that it will be enough
Oh, you are a miracle
You're sweeter than I've ever dreamed
You're so much more, more than beautiful
How can it be that you belong to me?
