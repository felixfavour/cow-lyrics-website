You know you and I've been through many hardships in life
They say people who believe, hardship has made us doubt
The very God of gods
But the apostle Paul said in his scripture
We are troubled on every side, yet not in distressed
We are perplexed but not in dispair
Persecuted but not forsaken
Cast down but we are never distroyed
And the conclusion of the whole matter is that
Finally the storm is over
It's time for us to reap what we have sewn
No doubt my brothers and sisters
God has given us a miracle, finally
Blackstreet
Finally we'll make it through the storm and the rain
It's time to give and praise and bless the Lord
If you believe in miracles, just you wait and see
'Cause finally we'll make it through it all
Bless the Lord (give him blessings)
Bless the Lord (give him blessings, yeah yeah)
'Cause finally (oh lord) we'll make it through it all
(finally we'll make it through it all)
Bless the Lord (yeah yeah)
Bless the Lord (Bless the lord, bless the lord)
'Cause finally we'll make it through the storm (gotta give him praises and props yeah, oh yeah yeah)
