Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Oh (oh)
I am a child of love
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Oh (oh)
Oh I am a child of love
Alright (yeah)
I was walking the wayside
Lost on a lonely road
I was chasing the highlife
Trying to satisfy my soul
All the lies I believed in
Left me crying like the rain
Then I saw lightning from heaven
Lord I've never... never been the same
(Hey!)
I'm going to climb a mountain
I'm going to shout about it
I am a child of love
I found a world of freedom
I found a friend in Jesus
I am a child of love
I felt the sting of the fire
but I saw you in the flame
Just when I thought it was over
You brought me out of the grave
Hallelujah
I'm going to climb a mountain
I'm going to shout about it
I am a child of love
I found a world of freedom
I found a friend in Jesus
I am a child of love
Yeah (yeah)
Oh (oh)
I am a child of love
Somebody say yeah (yeah)
Oh (oh)
I am a child of love
Yes I am
and nothing can change the way that you love me
O nothing can change the way
I belong to you
Yes I do
Nothing can separate O Lord
O nothing can change the way that you love me
No nothing can change the way
Oh o
I belong to you
Lord yes I do
Nothing can separate
Hey!
I'm going to climb a mountain
I am a child of love
I found a world of freedom
I am a child of love
...
I'm going to climb a mountain
I'm going to shout about it
I am a child of love
I found a world of freedom
I found a friend in Jesus
I am a child of love
Oh Yeah Yeah (yeah)
Oh (oh)
I am a child of love
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
