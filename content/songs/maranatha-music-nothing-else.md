I'm caught up in your presence
I just wanna sit here at your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never wanna leave
Oh! I'm not here for blessings
Jesus you don't owe me anything
More than anything that you can do
I just want you
I'm sorry, when I've just come ? the ?
I'm sorry, when I just sing another
 song
Take me back to where we started
I'll open up my heart to you
I'm sorry, when I've come with my agenda
I'm sorry, when I forgot you're ? in all
Take me back to where we started
I'll open up my heart to you
I'm caught up in your presence
I just wanna sit here at your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never wanna leave
Oh! I'm not here for blessings
Jesus you don't owe me anything
And more than anything that you can do
I just want you
I just want you and nothing else, nothing else, nothing else would do
I'm caught up in your presence
I just wanna sit here at your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never wanna leave
Oh! I'm not here for blessings
Jesus you don't owe me anything
More than anything that you can do
I just want you
