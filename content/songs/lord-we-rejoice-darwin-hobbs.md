Lord, we rejoice in the power of Your name
Lord, we rejoice in the power of Your name
We make a choice to voice our opinion
Your name is great
We proclaim Your dominion
Yesterday, today, and forever the same
We rejoice in the power of Your name
Mountains tremble at the sound of that name
We assemble just to proclaim Jesus reigns

Every knee must bow at the sound of that name
We lift a mighty shout just to proclaim
Jesus reigns, Jesus reigns
Lord, we rejoice in the power of Your name
Lord, we rejoice in the power of Your name
We make a choice to voice our opinion
Your name is great
We proclaim Your dominion...
