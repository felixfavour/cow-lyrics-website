Looking for the fellow,
that I will call my own, then I found you took me in.
Took away my sorrow, gave me a tomorrow now I have you I can't fear.
Now I don't feel hollow,
my life's turn to bore hole I have found a joy in my heart,
when the treble, auto,
turn around with solo this correspond to a voice, say
oga emerelem Ihe dimma, oga emerelem ihe ji kpoya 2
Ebubedike eehh
Tell me why I go suffer when I serve
a master that provide my everyday need,
He's any weather, He will never wither unchangeable on every way
People just dey halla,
this your God na wire and His ways are so mysterious
Iyeh, even in wahalla,
He's my shock absorber that is why I stand and say
When I face challenges,
yes I think of cases where you showed me your awesome power,
life is full of phases, all this come with pages,
what would matter is I have you, laughter filled with blazes,
tears of joy with dazes dripping on
my eye as I lift my voice and say ...
