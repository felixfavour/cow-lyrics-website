It's been one of those days
Where all my blue has turned to grey
A thunderstorm
Above me forms
And I need sheltering
So Maker of the wind and rain
Can you calm the hurricane
In my soul
Out of control
Or help me face what may
'Cause
I love you
I want you
I need you right now
I can't live without you
Don't wanna learn how
With all of my heart
I surrender, I bow
Elohim, Cover me
No matter how hard I try
Nothing seems to satisfy
The deepest part of my heart
Where shallowness resides
'Til I'm so desperate I call Your name
And you revive my soul once again
Of all that I
Crave inside
This can't be denied
