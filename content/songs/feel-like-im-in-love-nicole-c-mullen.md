You say, "I dont look at you, the same way that I used to."
I say, "I just want romance, like this novel in my head."
You say, "Baby, now you know you can't believe, every little thing you read"
And I say, "Yeah I know it's make believe, but the feelings can be achieved."
"So tell me what I can do girl, to let you know my love is true."
And I say, "There's only one thing that I want:
I wanna feel like I'm in love (with you)
Wanna sing like I'm in love (with you)
Wanna dance like I'm in love (with you)
Take a chance like I'm in love (with you)."
Say I dont smile at you the same way that I used to
I say I just wanna know, how much you love me Romeo
Love me more then all the pretty girls you see, walk around on the TV
How about your favourite things, do you love me more then these?
"Tell me what I can do girl to let you know that my love is true"
And I say there's only one thing that I want
Only one thing that I want
Only one thing that I want
I wanna feel like I'm in love (with you)
Wanna dance like I'm in love (with you)
Wanna smile like I'm in love (with you)
Romance like I'm in love (with you)
You know baby, now you know
You can't believe my volume to reality
Now it ain't make believe
The feelings can be achieved
And I'll show you what I'm gonna do
To let you know my love is true
'cuz your the one thing that I want
The one thing that I want
The one thing that I want
