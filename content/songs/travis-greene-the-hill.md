The Hill... Hill... Hill
Sin around me
Pain is in me
Stress is on me
But I gotta keep looking up
Tears are streaming
Heart is beating
Others leaving
But I gotta keep looking up
Some will trust in horses and chariots
But I will look to the hills and I will not fear
Some may say that they found another way
But my eyes are on you and I will not move from...
The Hill... The Hill... Hill
Trouble has found me
Pressure is crowding
People doubting
But I gotta keep looking up
Ground is shaking
Walls are breaking
And my heart is racing
But I gotta keep looking
Some will trust in horses and chariots
But I will look to the hill and I will not fear
Some may say that they found another way
But my eyes are on you and I will not move ...
Some may trust in horses and chariots
But I will look to the hill and I will not fear
Some may say that they found another way
But my eyes are on you and I will not move

On the hill there's a cross
On the cross there is blood for me...for me
On the hill there's a cross
On the cross there is blood for me...for me

We were planning..... we were planning for my mother funeral
She has lost over fifty pounds
And we were planning for her funeral
It got soo bad that we
Relatives were crying because she didn't even look like herself
And the rumors have started spreading that she was already dead
But the strength that were on his flesh two thousand years ago
At the same hour of the day
And By his stripes we're healed
By his stripes we're healed
Few months ago the doctor came to me
She pulled me out to the hall
when we found out that my wife water broke
She said well Twenty one weeks, of course the baby is not going to make it
So We're going ahead to pull the baby out,
And you guys are going to try again
Something rose up in us
They said we trust God too much to give up
I don't know who that word is for,
But I need you to trust God too much to give up.
I don't want to know what the doctor said
But by his stripes we're healed
On the hill there's a cross on the cross there is blood for me
On the hill there's a cross on the cross there is blood for me
On the hill there's a cross on the cross there is blood for me
On the hill there's a cross on the cross there is blood for me
