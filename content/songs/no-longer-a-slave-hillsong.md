You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone


I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God


From my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I’ve been born again, into a family
Your blood flows through my veins


I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God


I am surrounded
By the arms of the father
I am surrounded
By songs of deliverance
We've been liberated
From our bondage
We're the sons and the daughters
Let us sing our freedom


You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me
And I will stand and sing
I am the child of God


I am a Child of God

I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
