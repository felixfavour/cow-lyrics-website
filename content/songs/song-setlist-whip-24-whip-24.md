And Your kingdom shall not pass away

Oh Ancient of Days

To the lamb of God forever

Jehovah meliwo Omeliwo

Jehovah you are the most high

You are the most high God

The battle is over, the victory is won

Cos Jesus has won all the victory for me

..and our steps are all ordered by his light

and we will never compromise

I've got victory in Jesus Amen

He has won the victory for me, amen!

Why should I fear, why should I worry, amen!

He has won the victory for me, amen!

“Look and live,” my brother, live.

Look to Jesus now and live.

’Tis recorded in His Word, Hallelujah!

It is only that you “look and live.”
