Let everything that has breath praise the Lord

Offer thanksgiving with music and singing
Let evеrything that has breath
Let evеrything that has breath
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord
Let the earth be filled with His glory
Let the earth be filled with His joy
Let the earth be filled with His goodness
Let everything that has breath sing and praise the Lord
Let there be glory and honor and praises
Let all the hosts of heaven and earth rejoice
Offer thanksgiving with music and singing
Let everything that has breath
Let everything that has breath
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord
