There are certain things in life that you feel
And then there are other things that you know
And what I've come to know
Has taken all my days
(All my days)
I know it's not just the way I feel
His love is so real
I know, beyond what words can say
He hears when I pray
All of my days, all of my days
Oh, yeah, whoo!
Here we go!
I have seen sunshine through the rain
And though my life's been good
I have felt some pain
Yet anytime I needed someone
Who'd take the time to hear me out
He's always there to calm my fears
And ease my doubts
That is why I know throughout all my days
I can say...
