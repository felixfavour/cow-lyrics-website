No longer what we were before
But not all that we will be
Tomorrow, when we lock the door
On all our compromising
When He appears
He'll draw us near
And we'll be changed by His glory
Wrapped up in His glory....
We will be like Him
For we shall see Him
As He is
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la....)
No longer what we saw before
But not all that we will see
Tomorrow, when we lock the door
On all our disbelieving
When He appears (holy, holy)
Our view will clear
And we'll be changed by His glory
Wrapped up in His glory....
But I'm caught in between
The now and the not yet;
Sometimes it seems like
Forever and ever
That I've been reaching to be
All that I am
But I'm only a few steps nearer
Yet I'm nearer....
