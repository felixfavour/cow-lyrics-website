I shall hold
To the cross
I shall hold
To God alone
For His love
Has salvaged me
For His love
Has set me free
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
Whosoever believes
Will not perish
They shall have eternal life
I shall wait
Upon the Lord
I shall wait
Upon His Word
By His grace
I am released
By His grace
I am redeemed
