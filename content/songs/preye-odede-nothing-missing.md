I have Paid every Price
For your Future and your past
Nothing Missing O
Nothing Missing O
No other Sacrifice
Every pain, every shame
Every struggle you've been through
I have Paid, Paid in Full,
For Nothing Missing
I have gone Ahead of you
Don't you Cry I'm here for you
Nothing Missing O
Nothing Missing O
No other Sacrifice
Nothing Missing O
Nothing Missing O
No thing Remain O
Nothing Missing O
Nothing Missing O
No thing Remain O
That Sickness
Is nothing before me
That Mountain
Is nothing before me,
I have Paid with my Blood
Nothing Broken
There is therefore
No other Sacrifice
There is therefore
Nothing Else to do
I have Paid with my Blood
For Nothing Remain O
 I have gone Ahead of you
Don't you Cry I'm here for you
Nothing Missing O
Nothing Missing O
No other Sacrifice
