[Intro: Choir & 
Tori Kelly
]
(Ooh)
It's so crazy to me
(Ooh)
How mistakes can be
(Ooh)
A blessing in disguise
(Ooh)
Lord, I'm so glad You're making me
A masterpiece
(Masterpiece) 
(Oh, Lord)
(Hit me!)
When You look at me
Do You see a work of art in the making?
A sketch of what I'll be, mmm
I wonder what You see in me
Like what do You think?
When my life is not a melody in the morning
And I feel off key, yeah
Do You still believe in me?
Like a symphony, hey
You know how to make all things work together
Crazy how mistakes can be miracles in disguise
