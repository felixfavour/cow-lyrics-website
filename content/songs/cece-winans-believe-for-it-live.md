They say this mountain can't be moved
They say these chains will never break
But they don't know You like we do
There is power in Your name
We've heard that there is no way through
We've heard the tide will never change
They haven't seen what You can do
There is power in Your name
So much power in Your name

Move the immovable
Break the unbreakable
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
We know that hope is never lost (Oh-oh)
For there is still an empty grave
God, we believe, no matter what
There is power in Your name
So much power in Your name

Move the immovable
Break the unbreakable
God, we believe (Yes, we do)
God, we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God, we believe
God, we believe for it, ayy, ayy
We believe
[Bridge]
You are the way when there seems to be no way
We trust in You, God, You have the final say, yeah
You are the way when there seems to be no way (Oh, yes, You are)
We trust in You, God, You have the final say
(You are the way)
You are the way when there seems to be no way
(I put my trust in You, Jesus)
We trust in You, God, You have the final say (Final say)

Move the immovable
Break the unbreakable
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God, we believe (Yes, we do)
God, we believe for it
(Move) Move the immovable
(Break) Break the unbreakable
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
Hallelujah

Oh, yeah

You said, I believe

You said it (By Your stripes, I'm healed), it is done (By Your stripes, I'm healed)

You said it (I believe it, I believe it), it is done (It is done)
