Lift every voice and sing
Till earth and heaven ring
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the listening skies
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea
Sing a Song full of the Faith
That the dark past has Taught us
Sing a Song full of the Hope
That the Present has Brought us
Facing the Rising Sun
Of our New day begun
Let us march on till Victory is Won
Stony the Road we Trod
Bitter the chastening Rod
Felt in the days when
Hope unborn had died
Yet with a steady beat
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place
For which our Fathers Sighed
We have come over a way
That with Tears has been watered
We have come, Treading our Path
Through the Blood
Of the Slaughtered
Out from the Gloomy Past
Till now we Stand at last
Where the White gleam
Of our bright star is cast
God of our weary years
God of our silent tears
Thou who has Brought us
Thus Far on the way
Thou who has by Thy might
Led us into the Light
Keep us forever in the Path, we Pray
Lest our feet stray from the Places,
Our God, where we met Thee
Lest, our hearts drunk
With the wine of the world,
We Forget Thee
Shadowed beneath Thy hand
May we forever stand
True to our God
True to our native land
Our native land
