You are the reason why we sing
You are the Rock Lord, everything
The Awesome King You're all I need
You're Mighty, You're Mighty
There's no one like You, no not one
Your love has given us Your son
The victory's already won
You're Mighty, You're Mighty
(repeat)
No one can sit upon Your throne
You're Mighty, You're Mighty
You created this world all on Your own
You're Mighty, You're Mighty
Touch the sick and make them well
The God of all, yes we can tell
You're Mighty, You're Mighty
Yeah ohh yeah
Master please take hold of me
And do whatever that You please
Make a champion out of me
You're Mighty, You're Mighty
We give you glory with our hearts
And nothing can take us apart
Have your way I work so hard
You're Mighty, You're Mighty
