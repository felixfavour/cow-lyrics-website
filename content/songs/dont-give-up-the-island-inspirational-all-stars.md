(Intro)
(Kirk Franklin)
Ah Yeah, Livin' Holy In The Night On The Gospel Tip, Uh!
Yeah, This Time Brought My Family and Some Friends
Just To Tell You No Matter But Hard You Gets, No Matter
How Rough Every Brother Every Sister Our Thing
Listen, Don't Give Up
(Donald Lawrence)
I know the day is dim chances may be slim hold on to what you believe, yeah
(Hezekiah Walker)
I know it hurts inside, sometimes you sit and cry, you gotta hold on to what you believe
(Bridge)
(The Family)
Trouble only lasts for a while
(HW)
But joy's gonna come with the morning light
(The Family)
And to every life, some rain must fall
(HW)
But trials come to make you strong
