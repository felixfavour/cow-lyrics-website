[Intro: Kirk Franklin, 
Travis Greene
]
Brother Travis would like to say something to somebody
(Ya gotta hold on me)
Let's give him a hand as he comes
Thank you
If I could have your attention
Don't mean to waste your time
I'd like to tell a little story (A story)
How I was lost and couldn't find my way (Tell ya story)
But then I met Jesus (But then I met Jesus)
And something started to change
I ain't proud of the past
I'm proud of the fact
That I'm not who I was now
[Chorus: Travis Greene, 
Kirk Franklin
]
I am different now, every part of me (
The whole me
)
Has been touched by freedom
Oh Jesus, Ya gotta hold on me
I fell but somehow You refused to leave (You refused to leave)
Now all my wrong forgiven (Alright)
Oh Jesus (One more witness) Ya gotta hold on me
Brother John, yes sir
