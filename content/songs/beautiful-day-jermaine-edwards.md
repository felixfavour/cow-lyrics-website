Lord, I thank you for sunshine
Thank you for rain
Thank you for joy
Thank you for pain
It's a beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay
It's a beautiful day-ay
Aye, Prinz (Lord, I thank you for sunshine)
Lord, I wanna thank you for this blessing (I do)
Give thanks to my family
They're the reason that I ain't been stressin'
'Cause it's a beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay
It's a beautiful day-ay
Yo, look (Lord, I thank you for sunshine)
It's a beautiful day and I mean it (I mean it)
And when the nighttime comes
I give him thanks before I'm sleeping
'Cause it's a beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay
It's a beautiful day-ay
Wake up, I step out of bed (I step out of bed)
As I'm reading the holy scripture
I told my mum I'll make her proud
I'm working hard, I'll make her richer (harder, make her richer)
And I have no doubt in my mind like MJ
I follow that man in the mirror
when I'm in need of protection
He's my strength, he's my pillar
He puts food on my families plate
So I'm thankful for the roof I have
I'm thankful for my lunch and dinner
They use to hate on my ting (they hate on my ting)
But they wanna call me a winner (call me a winner)
I've seen people change like seasons
From autumn to the winter (Lord, I thank you for sunshine)
Thank you for rain
Thank you for joy
Thank you for pain
Beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay
It's a beautiful day-ay
Lord, I thank you for sunshine
Lord, I wanna thank you for this blessing (I do)
Give thanks to my family
They're the reason that I ain't been stressin'
'Cause it's a beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay
It's a beautiful day-ay
Lord, I thank you for sunshine
Thank you for rain
Thank you for joy
Thank you for pain
It's a beautiful day-ay-ay-ay-ay
It's a beautiful day-ay
