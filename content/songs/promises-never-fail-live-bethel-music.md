You are with me
What can separate us?
You are for me
What can stand against us?
Your love, it won't let go
I know it won't
Darkness, shadows
Have no power over me
Fear is empty
Shame has no authority
Your love, it won't let go
I know it won't
I know Your thoughts
Your plans for me are good
And I know You hold
My future and my hope
Your promises never fail
Your promises never fail
Healing, freedom
As You speak favor over me
Faith is breaking
All impossibility
Your name has overcome
Your name alone
