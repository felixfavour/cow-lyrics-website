Come and see the glory of the Lord
Come behold The Lamb
Come and know the mercy of the King
Bowing down before Him
Come and give, thanks unto the Lord (thanks unto the Lord)
Come behold the Lamb (Come behold the Lamb)
Come and sing the praises of the King (Come and praise Him)
Bowing down before Him
For He is Lord above the heavens
Lord in all the earth
Lord of all the angels
Worthy to be served
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Come and see the glory of the Lord
Come behold The Lamb
Come and know the mercy of the King
Bowing down before Him
