People, come together
Strange as neighbours, our blood is one
(Come on, you sing)
Children of generations
Of every nation, of kingdom come
Don't let your heart be troubled (Come on)
Hold your head up high
Don't fear no evil
Fix your eyes on this one truth
God is madly in love with you (Hey!)
Take courage, hold on, be strong
Remember where our help comes from
([1:22?], what's His name?)
Jesus, our redemption
Our salvation, is in His blood
(Comе on, loud as we can, we sing)
Jesus, light of Hеaven
Friend forever, His kingdom come
(Alright)
So don't let your heart be troubled (Come on)
Hold your head up high
Don't fear no evil
Fix your eyes on this one truth
God is madly in love with you
So take courage, hold on, be strong
Remember where our help comes from
