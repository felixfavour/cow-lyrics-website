I know what it's like
To be in the presence of the Lord
And not know what time it is
Because time stood still.
And bodies were healed
Families restored
Because we stayed here
In the presence of the Lord.
And no one had to say a word
Couldn't even make a sound
But I give up everything
For this treasure I found.
I never want it to end
So I say stay
I don't want You to go
Cos my heart is burning
In Your presence Lord
Please stay
I dont want You to go
Cos my heart is burning
In Your presence Lord
And I want more
I want more
I want more
Jesus I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
Jesus I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
Jesus I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
Jesus I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
Jesus I want more
So I'll stay
Where else would I go?
Cos my heart is burning
my heart is burning
My heart is burning (When You talk to me)
My heart is burning (When I'm in Your presence)
My heart is burning
My heart is burning
My heart is burning
My heart is burning
In Your presence Lord
