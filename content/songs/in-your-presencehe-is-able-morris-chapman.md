In Your Presence I am content
In Your Presence I am content

In your Presence there is light
Expressions of Your life
Revelations of Your Power and Might

In Your Presence I can bring
My love song offering
I'm in the Presence of my King

In Your Presence I am content
In Your Presence I am content

In your Presence there is light
Expressions of Your life
Revelations of Your Power and Might
In Your Presence I can bring
My love song Offering
I'm in the Presence of my King

In Your Presence there is light
Expressions of Your life
Revelations of Your Power and Might

In Your Presence I can bring
My love song offering
I'm in the Presence of my King

He is able more than able
To accomplish what concerns me today
He is able more than able
He can handle anything that comes my way
He is able more than able

To do much more than I could ever dream
He is able more than able
To make me what He wants me to be

He is able more than able
To accomplish what concerns me today
He is able more than able
He can handle anything that comes my way

He is able more than able
He can do much more than I could ever dream
He is able more than able
To make me what He wants me to be

He is able more than able
He can do much more than I could ever dream
He is able more than able
To make me what He wants me to be
He can make me what He wants me to be
To make me what He wants me to be (REPEAT)
