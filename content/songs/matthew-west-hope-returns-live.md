Intro]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
So this is how it feels when standing strong
Turns into barely even holding on
The plans you had are shattered on the floor
And your fear tells your faith
There's no use in praying those prayers anymore

When your world is crashing
when your knees hit the ground
When your heart is asking
"What do I do now?"
Just when you think it can't get worse
Hold on,
that's when hope returns.
Like a new sun breaking
through the darkest night
Like a whisper saying,
"It'll be alright"
I know you're tired, I know it hurts
But hold on,
 that's when hope returns.
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
And that's when hope returns
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
I know it's hard to see the other side
Through all the where are you's and don't know why's
And I know it looks like hope is in the grave
But He's still on the throne, so be still and know
That He's still rolling stones away
Chorus]
So when your world is crashing,
 when your knees hit the ground
When your heart is asking,
"What do I do now?"
Just when you think it can't get worse
Hold on, that's when hope returns
Like a new sun breaking
through the darkest night
Like a whisper saying,
 "It'll be alright"
I know you're tired,
I know it hurts
But hold on, that's when hope returns.
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
Yeah, hold on 'cause hope returns
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)

When your world is crashing, when your knees hit the ground
When your heart is asking,
"What do I do now?"
Just when you think it can't get worse
Hold on, that's when hope returns.
Like a new sun breaking
 through the darkest night
Like a whisper saying, "It's gonna be alright"
I know you're tired,
I know it hurts
But hold on, that's when hope returns.
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
That's when hope returns
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
