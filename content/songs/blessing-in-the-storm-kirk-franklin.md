[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
This album is dedicated to everybody that's been going through it
I hope you've enjoyed this record
I hope it's ministered to your heart and soul
Please continue to keep us in your prayers
And we'll be praying for your family, too
I just got one more thing I wanna leave with you if you're going through something
Family
When I cannot feel the sparrow sing
And I cannot feel the melody
There's a secret place (
Uh-huh
)
That's full of grace (
Yes, sir
)
There's a blessing in the storm (
Yes, it is
)
Help me sing it (
Uh-huh
)
There's a blessing in the storm
[Interlude: Kirk Franklin]
Some of y'all wouldn't pray if you didn't go through something
And when you go through something, that's when you'll meet Jesus
Can I get a witness in here?
And listen, if you're really sick in your body and feel like giving up, listen
When the sickness won't leave my body
And the pain just won't leave my soul
(
This is all you gotta do
)
I get on my knees and say, "Jesus, please"(
Call on Him, call on Him
)
There's a blessing in the storm
(
I need a witness in here
)
Help me sing it (
Ow
)
There's a blessing in the storm
