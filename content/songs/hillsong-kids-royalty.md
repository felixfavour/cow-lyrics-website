God made me who I'm meant to be
He loves me just the way I am
God made me who I'm meant to be
His dream for me is so amazing
Pre-Chorus:
And for this simple reason I am happy to be me
Chorus:
Whoa Oh, Whoa Oh, My God watches over me
Whoa Oh, Whoa Oh, I feel like royalty
And for this simple reason I am happy to be me
