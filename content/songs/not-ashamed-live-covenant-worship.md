Set free now from my past, by Your love that's everlasting
I'm not ashamed of who You are, I know what I believe
You bled and died for me, it's Your grace that sets me free
I'm not ashamed of who You are, I know what I believe
[Pre-Chorus]
And every day now that I live, I'm thankful for the cross
Now with nothing left to give, still You gave me Your all
And it's grace that saves and sets me free
Your love has made a way for me
I'm not ashamed to lift my hands and sing
My Savior hung up on that tree
And all I am I owe to Thee
I'm not ashamed to lift my hands and sing
Set free now from my past, by Your love that's everlasting
I'm not ashamed of who You are, I know what I believe
You bled and died for me, it's Your grace that sets me free
I'm not ashamed of who You are, I know what I believe
[Pre-Chorus]
And every day now that I live, I'm thankful for the cross
Now with nothing left to give, still You gave me Your all
