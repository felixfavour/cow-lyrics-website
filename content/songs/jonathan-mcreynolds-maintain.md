Hmmm...
I see you moving all the needed people out my life
And am trying to get these crazy thoughts out of my mind...
Yeah, You gave me all the weapons... but it's still a fight
So help me maintain
Help me maintain
I don't wanna live in stress or fear
Cuz its getting crazier... everyday out here
All the love and peace you gave to me... I hold so dear
So help me maintain.
Help me maintain
Cuz soon... as... i... walk out the door
I need... You... more... and... more
Hmmm...
See, I realized that sometimes am just not that smart
But i desperately just wanna be where You are...
And compared to a while ago, I've gotten far
So help me maintain
Help me maintain
Hmmmm...
Cuz as soon... as... I... walk out the door
I need... You... more... and... more
You...
