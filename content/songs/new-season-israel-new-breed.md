[Intro]
It's a new season, it's a new day
A fresh anointing is flowing my way
It's a season of power and prosperity
It's a new season coming to me
It's a new season, it's a new day
A fresh anointing is flowing my way
It's a season of power and prosperity
It's a new season
It's a new season
It's a new season
It's a new season
The devil's time is up, no longer can he bother me
'Cause the Creator of the universe, He fathers me
And it's transferable, my children's children shall be free
It's a new season (It's a new season)
If you don't know by now, you need to know it's jubilee
Where debts are cancel and your children walk in victory
It's so available to you right now, just taste and see
It's a new season (It's a new season)
