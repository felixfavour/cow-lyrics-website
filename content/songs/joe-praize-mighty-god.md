Oh Lord, my God, Jesus
I'll speak of you Glory,

If I dance it wont be enough,
If Iï»¿ shout it wont be enough (Repeat)
For you are the great and mighty King
You rule in every nation
Oh praise this Holy God,
You are worthy to be praised
You are Alpha and Omega, I worship you today
In you I put my trust, You name I will extol
Heaven speaks of your glory
And the earth of your beauty
Your love is new every morning
And your faithfulness is ever sure (Repeat)
For you are the great and mighty God
So worthy to be praised
Your beautiful for all situation
You are the joy of the whole world (Repeat)
