And let the fires burn again
Go back to your first love
Go back to your first love
Go back, return
And let the fires burn again
I'm reminded of the days of passion
When my worship flowed so unrestrained, remember
Like the prodigal I've learned my lesson, yeah
And I never want to be the same
I'm coming closer, closer to the flame
And I can hear Your voice as clear
As the first day, You say
