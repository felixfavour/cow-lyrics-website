We'll never bow
We're not afraid to call Your Name
Bring on the crowds
Soon some day their noise will fade
When you crack the clouds
Sons and daughters will be rescued
Chorus
So we'll do anything and everything just to spend a lifetime with you
Yes anything and everything so my forever is with you
Yes we refuse
To have any other God but you
Well never lose yes our powers weak but yours rescues
That's why we choose
We choose the one who makes all things new
Chorus
So well do anything and everything just to spend a lifetime with you
Yes anything and, everything so, my forever is with you
Bridge
That's why I surrender all
Ooh...I surrender all
All to thee my blessed saviour
I surrender all
We're here for a while, but this place is not our home
Some days we smile, but many nights we cry alone
But soon the praise will give way you'll call us by name
And well all sing our brand new song
Chorus 2
So well do anything and everything just to spend a lifetime with you
Yes everything that, we've ever been through, will be worth it when we see you
