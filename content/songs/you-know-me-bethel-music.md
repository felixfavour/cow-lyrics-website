And You have been
And You will be
You have seen
And You will see
[Pre-Chorus]
You know when I rise and when I fall
When I come or go, You see it all
You hung the stars and You move the sea
And still You know me
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, You know me
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
You have been
And You will be
And You have seen
And You will see
[Pre-Chorus]
You know when I rise and when I fall
When I come or go, You see it all
You hung the stars and You move the sea
And still You know me
