Not to us, O Lord
Not to us, O Lord
But to Thy name give glory
To Thy name give praise
Not to us, O Lord
Not to us, O Lord
But to Thy name give glory
To Thy name give praise
As children of a mighty King
We make our lives an offering
All we have, we bring to give
The honor and the love
That You alone are worthy of
Not to us, O Lord
Not to us, O Lord
But to Thy name give glory
To Thy name give praise
We were weak, You made us strong
Gave us hope when hope was gone
So, when we lift our song of praise
With single voice and mind
Our thankful hearts will always say...
