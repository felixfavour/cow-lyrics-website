You came from heaven down to earth
And carried the weight of every pain and every hurt
Your life was a portrait of Your love, love
And like a beating drum, now You are alive in us
[Chorus: Jon White]
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No, we're never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No, we're never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
[Drop: Jon White]
We've got a fireblazin in our hearts
No, we're never gonna stop
Until the whole world knows who You are
Who You are, who You are
We are a city that believes
That when we're lost, in You we find everything we need
So let our lives be a portrait of Your love, Your love
And just like the risin' sun, break out and shine through us
