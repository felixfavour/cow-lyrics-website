[Intro]
Ooh, Your heart, oh
Your heart, oh
Here I stand before You now
As honestly as I know how
Broken by the days gone by
Spirit help my soul to rise
Ooh, ooh
I try my best but still I fail
And even then You're with me there
You remind me Iâ€™m a child of God
Regardless of the things I've done
Oh, my hope is found in perfect love
Oh-oh, oh
Your mercy triumphs over judgment
Love wider than horizons, stronger than all sin (Ooh)
Lord, Your kindness, it leads us to repentance
To the heart of God (To Your heart, God)
Your heart, oh God (Oh, Jesus)
Is all I want
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
