Let the Army Roar (Hey Hey)
Let the Army Roar (Hey Hey)
Let the Army Roar (Hey Hey)
Let the Army Roar (Hey Hey)
An Army is Rising
That won't take No for an Answer
If we must have You
Nothing Less than all of You
An Army is Rising
That won't take No for an Answer
If we must have You
Nothing Less than all of You
(all of You)
(Pre  Chorus)
Because we won't Wait
For You to come
We are Right where You are
We're Desperate for all of You
Nothing Less than that
Because we won't Wait
For You to come
We are Right where You are
We're Desperate for all of You
Nothing less than all
(Chorus)
Let the Army Roar (Hey Hey)
Let the Army Roar (Hey Hey)
Let the Army Roar (Hey Hey)
Let the Army Roar (Hey Hey)
(Repeat Verse)
An Army is Rising
That won't take No for an Answer

We're Desperate for all of You
Nothing Less than all
