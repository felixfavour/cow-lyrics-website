Exceedingly, Abundantly
Above all, all you could ask or think
According to, the power
That worketh in you, you...

God is able to do just what he said he would do
He's gonna fulfill every promise to you
Don't give up on God, cause he won't give up on you
He's able

God is able to do just what he said he would do
He's gonna fulfill every promise to you
Don't give up on God, cause He won't give up on you
He's able
He's able

Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
He's able

He's able, He's able
He's able, He's able
