[Instrumental]
God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You
Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You
I will seek You in the morning
And I will learn to walk in Your ways
And step by step, You'll lead me
And I will follow You all of my days
God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You
God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You
I will seek You in the morning
And I will learn to walk in Your ways
And step by step, You'll lead me
And I will follow You all of my days
And I will follow You all of my days...
Hallelujah!
We honour You, Lord Jesus
And forever we will sing
Hallelujah!
For You alone are worthy
And forever we will sing
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!!
