Who can calm the raging storm?
Who can keep me safe from harm?
Who has an everlasting arm?
Nobody else, nobody else
And when I am lost, can't find my way
When I am scared of come what may
Who is my shelter and my strength?
Nobody else, nobody else, so
Blessed be Your name, yeah
Blessed be the One who men and angels praise
Blessed be Your name
You are God and forever you reign
You are God and forever you reign
Who can wash away my sin?
Who can cleanse me deep within?
Who conquered death and rose again?
Nobody else, nobody else
And when life is beautiful and new
When I've lost everything but you
Whose promises will see me through?
Nobody else, nobody else
