We've been together for so long now
But I don't think I can go on like this
Every time I try to break out
You're always there parading my regrets
I remember when you told me that it could never get better than this
Turns out the truth is that you sold me
This fake identity
Something's gotta give
This is no way to live
I'm not who I was
I'm not what I've done
Love changed everything
What I've been searching for
Has finally found me
From the beginning, up until now
You fought to be the voice inside my head
You controlled me
'Til I found out my true identity
I've got so much to give
A better life to live now
I'm not who I was
I'm not what I've done
Love changed everything
What I've been searching for
Has finally found me
So long
Goodbye
No more you and I
What we had is through
I see my future now without you
Old ways are done
I'm breaking up with the old me now
Breaking up with the old me now
It's over
I'm not who I was
Oh, I'm not who I was (who I was)
Oh, and I'm not what I've done (I've done)
Your love changed everything
What I've been searching for has finally found me
Finally found me
Finally found me
