I call You "maker"You give life an eternal spark
I call You "healer"You can mend any broken heart
I call You "faithful Father"You finish everything You start
My soul was made
To respond
I know You by a thousand names
And You deserve every single one
You've given me a million ways
To be amazed at what You've done
And I am lost in wonder
At all You do
I know You by a thousand names
And I'll sing them back to You, yeah
Sing them back, sing them back to You
Your love is boundless
Beyond what I could dream
Your grace is patient
You'rе never giving up on me
I call You "bondagе-breaker"'Cause You're handing out the prison keys
My soul was made
To be free
