How can I thank You for the way that you freely gave
Love so beautiful unconditionally
Had to stop take a break feelin' good today
Everything's wonderful You didn't have to do this for me
But then I look and see all of the suffering
I wanna do something
But something's gotta start with me
I can't give till I live it
Now that my eyes are open
Teach me how to love
Love God love people
Love my neighbor as myself
My brother, my sister
Everybody love somebody
Love somebody
And now it's time to make a change
Revolution day
Put it into action live compassionately
You take the black and the white
Red yellow brown
Life gets better
