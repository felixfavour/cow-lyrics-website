Capable God o
What can't You do?
What won't You do?
Nothing impossible
Nothing impossible
What can't You do?
What won't You do?
Nothing impossible with our God
You do not lie
You do not fail
What is hard for You to do?
It doesn't exist oh
It can never ever exist oh
You do not lie
You do not fail
What is hard for You to do?
It doesn't exist oh
It can never ever exist oh
According to Your knowledge and Your will for me
What You say You have done
I just need to align oh
Because You are not a man that changes Your mind oh
Those that know You will trust in You
Not in Horses and Chariots
By the arm of flesh
No man can prevail
No man, No man
No man, No man
My confidence is You
What is hard?
What is hard for You?
It can never exist oh
You do not lie
You do not fail
What is hard for You to do?
It doesn't exist oh
It can never ever exist oh
You do not lie
You do not fail
What is hard for You to do?
It doesn't exist oh
It can never ever exist oh
Those that know You will trust in You
Not in horses and chariots
By the arm of flesh
No man can prevail
Ask Abraham and Sarah
And the Woman with the issue of blood oh
Nothing nothing hard for You
Ask Mama Hannah
Blind Bartimaeus
Make You go ask the Israelites
Absolutely nothing hard for You
No man, No man
No man
My confidence is You
What is hard?
What is hard for You?
It can never exist oh
You do not lie
You do not fail
What is hard for You to do?
It doesn't exist oh
It can never ever exist oh
You do not lie
You do not fail
What is hard for You to do?
It doesn't exist oh
It can never ever exist oh
No no no no
Capable God oh oh
It can never ever exist oh
