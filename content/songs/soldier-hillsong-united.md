Can't nobody stop me now
Cause i'm part of the army now
Praise the LORD is what i wanna shout
Even in a crowd i'm gonna sing it Loud
You can see what you want to see
But i know what he's done for me
Every day i can feel his power
'Cause the spirit of the Lord
He lifts me higher
All the world, can't stop, can't stop him
All the world, can't stop, can't stop him now
My God is the strongest tower
Turn to him in the scary hour
Even when it gets harder now
All i wanna do is just praise him louder
Keep singing 'til my voice run out
Keep running til he lifts me out
Keep singing it cause i can't stop
Oh, i can't stop
You got the give yourself up
You got to lose your pride
You got to see it different
Open up your spiritual eyes
