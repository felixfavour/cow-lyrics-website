When I think of how the moon
Has the ocean on a string and you
Hold me in your gravity, it's God
It has to be God
And when I hear the man
Singing our song on the street, there's
Something that lifts me
Like a melody, it's God, yeah
It has to be God
It's bigger than religion
And it's more than just a dream
It's higher than logic
When it comes to you and me
It's God
Can't deny the truth
When I look at you
This love that we've got
It has to be God
I can feel the proof
When I'm holding you
This love that we've got
It has to be God
Some people say it's fate
But there's only one to thank
For the fortune (oh), blessings (hey)
That we can't contain (oh-oh-oh, ooh)
It's God (oh-oh-oh), it has to be God
He-eh
It's bigger than religion
And it's more than just a dream
It's higher than logic
When it comes to you and me
It's God
Can't deny the truth
When I look at you
This love that we've got (this love that we've got)
It has to be God
(Oh-oh-oh, oh)
I can feel the proof (oh, I can feel the proof, when)
When I'm holding you
This love that we've got (this love that we've got)
It has to be God (oh-oh, yeah)
This love has got me singing
Hallelujah (hallelujah)
Hallelujah (hallelujah)
Now, hallelujah (hallelujah)
This love has got me singing
Hallelujah (hallelujah)
Now, hallelujah (hallelujah)
Now, hallelujah (hallelujah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Can't deny the truth
When I look at you
This love that we've got
It has to be God
