Come empty me 'til I am clean
Remove the hurt that no one sees
So come in power, I need You now
Reverse the curse, I'm breaking out
I know that You make all things new
Turn my heart inside out
My life is Yours, You have it all
Take my past, today I live for You
Make all things new, make all things new
No longer blind, but now I see
No longer bound, but now I'm free
So come in power, I need You now
Reverse the curse, I'm breaking out
If any man be in Christ, he is a new creation
Old things are passed away, behold all things are new today
Can anybody testify that you're waving goodbye to your past
Gone (gone)
Gone (gone)
Gone (gone)
I'm moving on (on)
On (on)
On (on)
