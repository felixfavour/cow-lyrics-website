If you catch hell
Don't hold it
If you're going through hell
Don't stop (4x)
Remember no weapon
Formed against you
Shall prosper
And every tongue
That rises against you
You shall condemn (2x)
For greater is He that is in you
Than he that's in the world (2x)
Remember no weapon
Formed against you
Shall prosper
And every tongue
That rises against you
You shall condemn (2x)
Go ahead
Go ahead
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead (4x)
