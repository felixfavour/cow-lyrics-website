O, what a glorious God
O, what a powerful savior
All creation cries out around you
Holy is the Lord
O what a glorious God
O what a powerful savior
Mercy grace and goodness
Surround you
O-oh what a glorious God
O-oh what a glorious God
You speak with a voice
Like a crashing cymbal
O-Oh what a glorious God
You stretch forth your hand
And the whole world trembles
O-Oh what a glorious God
You rose from the dead
To redeem your people
O-Oh what a glorious God
You give us your strength
And we soar like eagles
O-Oh what a glorious God
