When You need someone to preach the Word
When You need someone to take Your Presence to the world
Lord You can count on me
I understand I was born for this
And I will not let this gospel fall to the ground
Lord, You can count on me
Where You want me to go I will go
I will do anything anything for You
Lord, You can count on me
You can count on me
You can count on me
You can count on me
You can count on me
I’m available
Lord, You can count on me
On me on me
Lord, You can count on me
Tada tada tada hahahha ehhy ehy yeah eh eh tadadadada
When You need someone to give life's mеaning
When You need someone to shinе Your light in dark places
Lord, You can count on me
When You need someone to be Your outstretched arm
And take Your priceless love to the people of the earth
Lord, You can count on me
Let say I say please count on me
Till every knee bow, I will never stop
Lord, You can count on me Lord You can count on me oh oh oh oh
