Babylon Lyrics
Babylon is fallen, fallen forever yeees
Fallen is that city, that city of old
That deceiveth the whole world
No more will you hear the sounds of children playing out in her open places
No more will you see cattle grazing her fields
Fallen is that city of old
No more will you hear the sound of music playing
All her children, they are slain in her day
No more will you hear the sound of buying and selling
The smoke of her burning is there for all to see
CHORUS
No more will you hear her soldiers in a victory procession
All her parades, they have come to an end
Even her language is taken away from her
Scattered is her power forever more
No more will you see her priests burn incense in her temple
All of her worship, it is come to and end
No more will you ever see the bride and groom again
Lonely and broken, she's gone forever more.
CHORUS
Babylon is fallen and it's music to my ears
(Instrumental interlude)
No more will you see a sailboat ride down her river
Cos her destruction there for all to see
Her laughter is broken and her jar of joy is gone
Fallen is that city forever more
But the fall of one is the rising of another
Say unto Zion, see your time is come
Lift up your head, shout the joyful sound all over Zion's hills
Your King will reign forever more
CHORUS
CHORUS ADLIB: Shout it out, let the nations hear
Call to every generation, from age to age, let this cry resound
Have no fear my children, lift up your heads see your King in glory is come, yeah
Babylon is fallen, let the earth rejoice
Surely, let the nations hear that this cry resound from age age
She's fallen forever
Have no fear, my children, Babylon is fallen, let the earth rejoice
The deceiver is gone forever more
She drinks the cup of indignation from the hand of the mighty King
No more will you see her priests burn incense in her temple
All of her worship, it is come to an end
No more will you ever see the bride and groom again
Lonely and broken, she's gone forever more
