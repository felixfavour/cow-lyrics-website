O Come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him, born the King of Angels
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of heavâ€™n above
Glory to God, glory in the highest
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
[Post-Chorus]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah
