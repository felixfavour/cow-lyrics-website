You came to save the world
To rescue me
To rescue me
You came to give us hope
You're all I need
You're all I need
You set our hearts on fire
It burns in me
It burns in me
Now You awaken us
For all to see
For all to see
Because Your love has set me free
Because Your love will never leave
Because You live and died for me
I live for You alone
We lift You higher
Our God
Your Name be lifted higher
In everything
We lift You up
We lift You up
We lift You up
