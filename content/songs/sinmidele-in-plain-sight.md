I try so hard to find You
But You've always been in plain sight
Morning noon and night
Oh You never hide
Where I go Your grace goes further
You carry me under Your wings
And bring me safely home (bring me safely home)
Where could I hide from Your presence
Oh tell me where could I run
When You're chasing me down in love
You go before and behind me
And walk beside me hand in hand
You are with me to the very end
Oh oh
You're not far away
You're close to me
Closer than my skin
I see you in everything
You're close to me
When the storms of life like an army
Come at me from every side
Threatening my soul to be affright
Your voice breaks through the chaos
And You bring me peace again
Over again
Oh oh
You're not far away
You're close to me
Closer than my skin
I see you in everything
You're close to me
With unveiled eyes
I see You now
Just as you are
In Your Majesty
You're in the storm
You're in the still
I see you now
In your Majesty
You're all around me
Oh you surround me
I see you in everything
I see you in everything
You're all around me
Oh you surround me
I see you in everything
You're with me through everything
You're all around me
And you surround me
I see you in everything
