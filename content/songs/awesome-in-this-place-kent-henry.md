As I come into Your presence
Past the gates of praise
Into Your sanctuary
â€²Til we're standing face to face
I look upon Your countenance
I see the fullness of Your grace
I can only bow down and say

You are awesome in this place
Mighty God
You are awesome in this place
Abba Father
You are worthy of our praise
To You our lives we raise
You are awesome in this place
Mighty God
