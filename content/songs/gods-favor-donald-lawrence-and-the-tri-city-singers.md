(feat. Donald Lawrence)
I know that you don't feel your best
Hold on, Be strong
God's not forgotten you
Broken dreams got you feeling blue
Hold on, be strong
God's looking out for you
Just remember at the end of the day
The favor of God can open the way
God's favor, is more precious than life
(God's favor, more precious, than life, to me)
I know that you don't feel up to the fight
Hold on, be strong
The battle is not up to you
Oh I hear you say, it just ain't no way
Hold on, be strong
God's got the final say
Just remember in the midst of your down
The favor of God can turn things around
God's favor more precious than life
(God's favor, more precious, than life, to me)
So what if doors are closed
God's favor can bring high places down
I know that you've been faithful
And when God get's ready to bless you
There is nothing no man can do
God's favor, more precious than life
