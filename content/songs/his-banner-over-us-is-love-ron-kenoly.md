Until the gospel of His kingdom has been preached
And every heart and every soul has been reached
Till every tribe and every nation
Has received His plan of salvation
We will carry His banner of love
To every city, every township and every vill
To every hedge, every highway and every hill
Till the plan of salvation
Has been heard in every nation
We will carry His banner of love
His banner over us is love
His banner over us is love
It bears the seal of His goodness
The stains of His blood
His banner over us is love
His banner over us is love
His banner over us is love
The cross of His suffering
The stains of His blood
His banner over us is love
So with the message of the cross we carry on
To declare on earth His kingdom has come
Till every tribe and every nation
Has received His plan of salvation
We will carry His banner of love
