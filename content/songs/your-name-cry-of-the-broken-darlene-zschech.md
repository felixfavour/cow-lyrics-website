As morning dawns and evening fades
You inspire songs of praise
That rise from earth
To touch Your heart
And glorify Your Name
Your Name
Is a strong and mighty tower
Your Name
Is a shelter like no other
Your Name
Let the nations sing it louder
'Cause nothing has the power to save
But Your Name
Jesus in Your Name we pray
Come and fill our hearts today
Lord give us strength to live for You
And glorify Your Name
Your Name
Is a strong and mighty tower
Your Name
Is a shelter like no other
Your Name
Let the nations sing it louder
'Cause nothing has the power to save
But Your Name
