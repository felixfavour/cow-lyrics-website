One of us is crying
As our hopes and dreams
Are led away in chains
And we're left all alone
And one of us is dying
As our love
Is slowly lowered in the grave
Oh, and we're left on our own
But for all of us who journey
Through the dark abyss of loneliness
There comes a great announcement
"We are never alone"For the One who made each heart that breaks
The Giver of each breath we take
Has come to earth
And given hope its birth
And our God is with us, Emmanuel
And He's come to save us (save us), Emmanuel
And we will never (never) face life alone
Now that God has made Himself known
As Father and Friend, with us through the end
Emmanuel!
