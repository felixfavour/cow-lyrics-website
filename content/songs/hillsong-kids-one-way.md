I lay my life at ur feet, you're the only one l need
l turn to you and you are always there
in troubled times is u l seek, l put first that's all l need
l humble all l am all to you
CHROUS
one way Jesus,you're the only one that l could live for (x2)
you're the only one,you're the only one
you're the only one that l could live for (x2)
VERSE 2
you are always,always there
every how and every where
your grace abounds so deeply within me
you will never ever change
yesterday today the same
forever till forever meets no end
       CHROUS (x4)
        BRIDGE
you are the way, the truth and the life
we live by faith and not my sight for you
we're living all for you (x4)
CHROUS (X4)
