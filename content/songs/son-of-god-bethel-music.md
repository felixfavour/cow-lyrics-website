There is a place of sorrow and love
The innocent Savior broken and bleeding for us
Nails in his hands, thorns on his brow
Rivers of mercy endlessly flowing down
The Son of God, high and lifted up
The Father's love came pouring down for us
He has overcome
There is a place for all who will come
His arms are open, our sins are washed white in His blood
The lost and unworthy, come find your home
The broken and hurting, His love will never let go
The Son of God, high and lifted up
The Father's love came pouring down for us
He has overcome
The spotless Lamb, for every sinner slain
Our victory, our hope beyond the grave
And He has overcome
And He has overcome, yeah
