[Chorus: Rick Pino]
I'm caught up in Your presence
I just want to sit here at Your feet
Caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave
I'm not here for blessings
Jesus, You don't owe me anything
It's more than anything that You can do
I just want You
[Bridge: Rick Pino & Abbie Gamboa, 
Rick Pino
]
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
[Chorus: Rick Pino & Abbie Gamboa, 
Rick Pino
, 
Abbie Gamboa
]
I'm caught up in Your presence
I just want to sit here at Your feet, 
yeah
Caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave
Jesus
, I'm not here for blessings, 
no-no-no-no
Jesus, You don't owe me anything
It's more than anything that 
You can do
I just want You (
I just want You
), 
yeah
