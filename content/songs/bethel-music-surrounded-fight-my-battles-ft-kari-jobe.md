This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles

It may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by You
Itâmayâlookâlike I'm surrounded,âbut I'm surroundedâby You
It may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by You

This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles, mm

It may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by You
[Bridge]
Rock of Ages, cleft for me
Let me hide, let me hide
Rock of Ages, cleft for me
Let me hide, let me hide
Let me hide myself in Thee

This is how I fight my battles, mm
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles, yeah
This is how I fight my battles
