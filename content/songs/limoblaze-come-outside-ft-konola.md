Come Outside Lyrics
Tell all the boys and girls we're here
To mash up the place
I'm one of the youngest in age
So make sure you're watching the space
God gifted us all of this grace
To rise up and battle with rage
Thats praying in tongues with base
I sound like a walking 808
The spirit is flowing in me
You see that when we come up on the stage
me and my mates,  we don't play
We're using music to break all of the chains
not here for the money or fame
We're here cause of Jesus' name
Scream it in caps
No lower case
We need to get to the secretest place
I'm not ashamed
How can I do it for fame?
It weren't me that healed
sick and the lame
It weren't me that
showed Noah the rain
It weren't me that made
water and grain
It weren't me that washed
all of my stains
Can't you see
we're not living the same
This is all done in Jesus' name
Why do you think that
we're running this race?
El diablo is running the chase
Gotta turn around
back the blade
The word of God splash his face
And I didn't leave a trace
Had nothing to do with this case
Cause It was done by the one
that died in faith
Then He rose up on the third of the day
Now He's got keys, to hell and the graves  
God's name gets glorified
Of course I tithe
He saved my life
I bang for Christ
I used to run and hide
Now I tell them boy there come outside
Cause I bang for Jesus Christ
God's name gets glorified
Of course I tithe
He saved my life
I bang for Christ
I used to run and hide
Now I tell them boy there come outside
I bang for Jesus Christ
Tell all the boys and the girls that I came in to shake up the game
They call me a star right now
But I promise the hunger the same
The mission the same
Lifting up Jesus's name
This is the reign of the children of Elohim
That never struggle to stay unashamed
I bring the wave to put the city in flames
Break all the shackles and chains
All of my days
I'll never go to a place
If I don't go in Jesus's name
Come outside
We ain't scared
We serve a God who raised the dead
What can man do to me
I'm Daniel in a lion's den
I used run and hide
Now I got angels by my side
Uo they threw us in the fire
Who's the 4th man in the fire
Oh yea we face the hurdles
But we bend it like Beckham
They try to press the m o
We keep it street it like Peckham
They tried to take my dinner  
Frankly I ate no Lampard
My God did not dessert us
Demons they getting shattered
God's name gets glorified
Of course I tithe
He saved my life
I bang for Christ
I used to run and hide
Now I tell them boy there come outside
Cause I bang for Jesus Christ
God's name gets glorified
Of course I tithe
He saved my life
I bang for Christ
I used to run and hide
Now I tell them boy there come outside
I bang for Jesus Christ
