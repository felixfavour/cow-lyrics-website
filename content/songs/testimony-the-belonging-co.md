[Instrumental]
Grace has a voice and it called my name
And came before I called
Mercy was willing and it took my place
And came before I called
You came before I called
I was lost now I am found, I was blind now all I see
Only this, Jesus is my testimony
Every curse is in the grave, my whole life has been redeemed
Free from sin, Jesus is my testimony
Love is the nails, it's the crown of thorns
For the cross has changed it all
Love like the world has never seen before
For the cross has changed it all
Yes, the cross has changed it all
I was lost now I am found, I was blind now all I see
Only this, Jesus is my testimony
Every curse is in the grave, my whole life has been redeemed
Free from sin, Jesus is my testimony
