[Chorus: Blu June]
I been messed up (Yeah)
Stressed out with no luck (Yeah)
But every time I wake up (Yeah)
I get a chance to wake up (Yeah)
Thank God I got a chance to wake up
Wake up, another day to get my cake up, cake up (Yeah)
'Cause every time I wake up (Yeah)
I get a chance to wake up (Yeah)
Wake up, wake up
Wake up lil' slick, get up outta bed
You was like a couple steps away from being out of here
Thank you from my Granny prayers
Thank you for my potna 'n 'dem
I thought I was finished here
Jesus told me, "Start again"I would party sundown 'til days end
Makin' money that I can't spend
I had a failing marriage and some fake friends
I had to doubt my doubts and let faith in
I was broken, God done brought me out like I was Moses
I'm chosen, woke up Sunday morning feeling focused
Funny actin', swipe left, that's on momma's
Always cappin', swipe left, yeah, no more drama
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm, boy, you know you blessed
Last night was a mess, God just hit refresh
