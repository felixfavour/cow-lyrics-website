[Chorus]
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
And whosoever believes will not perish
They shall have eternal life
I shall hold to the cross
I shall hold to God alone
For His love has salvaged me
For His love has set me free
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
And whosoever believes will not perish
They shall have eternal life
I shall wait upon the Lord
I shall wait upon His word
And by His grace, I am released
And by His grace, I am redeemed
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only Son
And whosoever believes will not perish
They shall have eternal life
