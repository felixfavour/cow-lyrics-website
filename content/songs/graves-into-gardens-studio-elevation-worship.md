I searched the world
But it couldn't fill me
Man's empty praise
And treasures that fade
Are never enough
Then You came along
And put me back together
And every desire is now satisfied
Here in Your love
Hey
Oh, there's nothing
Better than You
There's nothing
Better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You, oh
Now I'm not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws
Lord, You've seen 'em all
And You still call me friend
'Cause the God of the mountain
Is the God of the valley
There's not a place
Your mercy and grace
Won't find me again
