[Intro]
Gatherers are you ready
Come on let's put your hands together tonight
Come on here we go
When I think of Your goodness
And Your loving kindness
And I know Your grace is
And I know God’s graces
Giving me Life (Giving me Life)
Giving me Life (Giving me Life)
When I see Your favor
Over me I'm grateful
And I know my Savior's
Giving me Life
Giving me Life
Come on let's sing (Giving me Life) (Giving me Life)
It’s giving me life
It’s giving me life
Life
Exceedingly Life
Abundantly
Overflowing, Overwhelming
More than I can dream
You're giving me Life
