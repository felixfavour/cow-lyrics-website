No reputation, no stately bearing
No palace bed for royalty
But a star in the Heavens, a sign full of wonder
Announcing the coming of the King of kings
Rejoice, o world, your Savior has come
Through the love of a virgin's womb
Son of God, Son of man, born that we may have life
You were born that we may have life
A throne in a manger, the cross in a cradle
The hidden revealing this glorious plan
Of a Child who would suffer, a Child who would conquer
The sin of every woman, the sin of every man
[Chorus][x3]
[Bridge]
Rejoice, o world, rejoice
Rejoice, o world, Hallelujah, the Savior has come
Rejoice, o world, join with the angels
Rejoice, o world, rejoice
