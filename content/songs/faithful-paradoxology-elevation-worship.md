When I felt like the burden was more than I could hold
When the whispers of worry overwhelmed my soul
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You never left me alone
You were there all along
You are faithful
Why should my heart be afraid?
You are faithful
I know You're not gonna change
You are faithful, faithful
I was down to the wire, hoping You'd come through
Then You stepped in the fire like You always do
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now I'm convinced of Your love
You are more than enough
You are faithful
Why should my heart be afraid?
You are faithful
I know You're not gonna change
You are faithful, faithful
