[Instrumental]
All the earth come alive, lift your eyes to the morning
Let our hearts beat again with a lifeblood that never fails
Your love, it will never fail
Breaking down the divide in a holy collision
The Divine in disguise took the cross for our sin and shame
Our God, You will never fail
See the lost in return, swing the doors ever wider
See the tide, as it turns, love and mercy is on the rise
As the world folds into Your light
All creation will see Your light
[Instrumental]
Hear the sound of freedom rise as our song breaks the silence
Echoing the angel cry, let us lift up Your holy Name
Here-after to sing Your praise
Forever and ever
