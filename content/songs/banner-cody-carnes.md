Where You lead me I will follow
I don't have to be afraid
For You are with me clothed in victory
Bringing honor to Your name
[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, I know, yes, I know
That Your mercy follows me
Oh, I know, yes, I know
That Your goodness follows me
Oh, I know, yes, I know
That Your mercy follows me
Oh, I know, yes, I know!
Your love, Your love, Your love
Is a banner over me
If I'm found in darkest valleys
You'll be there to set a feast
At a table filled with laughter
Toasting to Your victory
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know, yes, I know
That Your mercy follows me
Oh, I know, yes, I know
That Your goodness follows me
Oh, I know, yes, I know
That Your mercy follows me
Oh, I know, yes, I know!
