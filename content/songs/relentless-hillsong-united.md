Salvation sounds a new beginning
As distant hearts begin believing
Redemption's bid is unrelenting
Your love goes on
Your love goes on
[Pre-Chorus]
You carry us, carry us
When the world gives way
You cover us, cover us
With Your endless grace
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
The time is up for chasing shadows
You gave the world a light to follow
A hope that shines beyond tomorrow
Your love goes on
Your love goes on
