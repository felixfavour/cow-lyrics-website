I wonder why they look at me strange
Like I don't belong on this row
I'm trying to figure out if I'm staying
'Cause I don't feel welcome here
I know I'm not dressed like everyone else
And I don't own a pair of church shoes
But I'm here because I needed some help
I'm starting to think that I made a bad move
[Chorus: Todd Dulaney]
But if they give me the chance
I only want to make it to the altar to see the man
That's why I came today to change my ways
And I'm not ashamed but they'rе pushing me away
I heard that church was the placе to come find my healing
But somehow I can't see how that's so
Everyone seems to be so uneasy
Maybe it's the way I look, I'm unsure
[Chorus: Q Parker]
'Cause if they give me the chance
I only want to make it to the altar to see the man (See the man)
That's why I came today to change my ways
And I'm not ashamed
