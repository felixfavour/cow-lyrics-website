I'm caught up in Your presence
God, I just want to sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never wanna leave
No I'm not here for blessings
'Cause Jesus You don't owe me anything
It’s more than anything that You can do
God, I just want You
Well I'm sorry when I've just gone through the motions
And I'm sorry when I just sang another song
Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to You
And I'm sorry
(I’m sorry)
When I've come with my agenda
I'm sorry
(I’m sorry)
When I’ve forgotten You're enough
Plеase take me back to whеre we started
I open up my heart to You
