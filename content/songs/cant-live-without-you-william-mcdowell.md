I can’t live
I can’t live without you
I was created to live in your presence
Can’t breathe. Can’t move
There is no life apart from you
[repeat]
[Chorus:]
I need you live
I need you to breath
Can’t Live without you
Can’t live without you
I need you live
I need you to breath
Can’t Live without you
Can’t live without you
I need you live
I need you to breath
Can’t Live without you
Can’t live without you
