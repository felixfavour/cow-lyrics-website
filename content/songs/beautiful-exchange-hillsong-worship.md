You were near though I was distant
Disillusioned, I was lost and insecure
Still mercy fought for my intention
You were waiting at the door
Then I let You in
Trading Your life for my offenses
For my redemption You carried all the blame
Breaking the curse of our condition
Perfection took our place
When only love could make a way
You gave Your life in a beautiful exchange
My burden erased, my life forgiven
There is nothing that could take this love away
And my only desire, my sole ambition
Is to love You just the same
When only love could make a way
You gave Your life in a beautiful exchange
When only love could break these chains
(You gave) You gave Your life in a beautiful exchange
