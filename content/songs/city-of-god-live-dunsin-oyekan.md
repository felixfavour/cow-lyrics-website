Somebody pray in the Holy Ghost
Speaking in tongues

Let your living water flow out of me
Let your Holy Spirit overshadow me

As it was in the beginning, so let it be now
I am the city, the city of God

Let your living water flow out of me
Let your Holy Spirit overshadow me

As it was in the beginning, so let it be now
I am the city, the city of God

Eden is no more a place, 
I am the city of God
I bring heaven,
Heaven here on earth

Eden is no more a place, 
I am the city of God
I bring heaven,
Heaven here on earth

Somebody pray in the Holy ghost
Pray in the Holy ghost
something is about to burst out from you
can a nation be born In a day
But as soon as zion travail

Let your living water flow out of me
Let your Holy Spirit overshadow me

As it was in the beginning, so let it be now
I am the city, the city of God

Let your living water flow out of me
Let your Holy Spirit overshadow me

As it was in the beginning, so let it be now
I am the city, the city of God

Eden is no more a place, 
I am the city of God
I bring heaven,
Heaven here on earth

Eden is no more a place, 
I am the city of God
I bring heaven,
Heaven here on earth
