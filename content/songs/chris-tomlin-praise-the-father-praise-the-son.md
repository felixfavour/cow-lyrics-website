O sovereign God, o matchless king
The saints adore, the angels sing
And fall before the throne of grace
To you belongs the highest praise
These sufferings, this passing tide
Under your wings I will abide
And every enemy shall flee;
You are my hope and victory

Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the spirit, three in one
Clothed in power and in grace
The name above all other names
To the valley, for my soul
Thy great descent has made me whole
You word my heart has welcomed home
Now peace like water ever flows
[X2]
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the spirit, three in one
Clothed in power and in grace
The name above all other names
[Bridge]
Yours is the kingdom
Yours is the power
Your is the glory forever
Yours is the kingdom
Yours is the power
Your is the glory forever

Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the spirit, three in one
Clothed in power and in grace
The name above all other names
The name above all other names
