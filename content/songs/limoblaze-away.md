Oh yeah, oh no no
Away, away oh away
Away oh away, away oh away (oh no)
Away oh away, away oh away (God's favourite baby, oh no)
Away oh away, away oh away
Omo, I'm a child of God
Me I no fit shout
When they see my swagger, they know I know no drought
Go away (oh yeah)
I say tell 'em go away
Anything baba God no give me oh
Away, away oh away (tell am)
Away oh away, away oh away (poverty nko)
Away oh away, away oh away (depression nko, addiction nko)
Away oh away, away oh away (sickness nko)
I'm a child of God, I've been bought by blood
If it can't hurt God, omo it can't hurt the boy
Who can be against me? (nobody, nobody)
When my God is for me (nobody, nobody)
'Cause of His righteousness, omo they can't touch the boy
I have no more debts, omo they can't fox the boy
Go away
I say tell 'em go away
Anything baba God no give me oh
Away, away oh away (tell am)
Away oh away, away oh away (poverty nko)
Away oh away, away oh away (depression nko, addiction nko)
Away oh away, away oh away (sickness nko)
Away, no limitations
Away, oh I am winning
Not by power, not by might
By His Spirit blessing me
I'm assured of my place
I'm in the center of His will
Nobody oh, nobody oh wey fit make the boy worry oh
Nobody oh, nobody
Anything baba God no give me oh
Away, away oh away (tell am)
Away oh away, away oh away (poverty nko)
Away oh away, away oh away (depression nko, addiction nko)
Away oh away, away oh away (sickness nko)
Away oh away, away oh away (frustration nko, barrenness nko)
Away oh away, away oh away (lukewarmness nko, starvation nko)
Oh no no, Limoblaze yo yo yo
