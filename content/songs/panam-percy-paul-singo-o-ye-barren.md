are going to sing word for word from the scriptures
Sing o ye barren 3x
For the Lord descends on me
Sing o ye barren 3x
For the Lord descends on me
Break forth into singing
And cry aloud
You who have not labored with a child
I will sing unto the Lord
Enlarge the place of your tent
And stretch out the curtains of your habitation
I will sing unto the Lord
(I tell you sing o ye barren)
Sing o ye barren 3x
For the Lord descends on me
Somebody take a look at me and say
Nothing good will ever come out of me
I will sing unto the Lord
This is my reason
For my Maker is my Husband
The Lord of Host is His name
I will sing unto the Lord
(Lift up Your voices sing o ye barren)
Sing o ye barren 3x
For the Lord descends on me
In righteousness you shall be established
And your children shall be taught of the Lord
I will sing unto the Lord
This is my reason
No weapon formed against you shall prosper
And every tongue that rises up against you
In judgment you condemn
I will sing unto the Lord
(Lift up your voices sing o ye barren)
Sing o ye barren 3x
For the Lord descends on me
(Lift up your voices sing o sing o)
Sing o ye barren 3x
For the Lord descends on me
(Lift up your voices sing o sing o)
Sing o ye barren 3x
For the Lord descends on me
(For the Lord descends on me) For the Lord descends on me
(For the Lord descends on me) For the Lord descends on me
(For the Lord descends on me) For the Lord descends
He descends on me
I tell you that
I will sing
No one shall stop me from singing
Because in my rejoicing is my miracle
Hallelujah
For the Lord descends on me
