This Christmas, take a little moment to remember
The baby in a manger, the promise of Heaven
Lift up your eyes, there is hope in the night
There is a reason, a reason to sing
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
This Christmas, take a little breather from the madness
There's new life in the stillness, and beauty for ashes
Lift up a song, every heart, every home
There is a reason, a reason to sing
Oh, a reason to sing, oh
[Bridge: William McDowell & Nicole Binion]
Jesus, You are the reason we sing, hallelujah
Jesus, You are the reason we sing, hallelujah
Jesus, You are the reason we sing, hallelujah
Jesus, You are the reason we sing, oh
[Outro: Nicole Binion]
This Christmas, take a little moment to remember Him
