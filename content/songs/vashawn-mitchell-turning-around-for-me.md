sometimes discouraged, but not defeated
cast down, but not destroyed
there are times I don't understand
but I believe it's turning around for me
I've had struggles and disappointments
There are times I felt so alone
Some of my friends, they let me down
But I still believe it's turning around for me
around for me around for me
around for me it's turning around for me
i can see the breaking of day
God is making a way
a change is coming for me
if I stand strong and believe
there's no reason to doubt
i know He's working it out
it's turning around for me
It won't always be like this
The Lord will perfect that concerning me
Sooner or later, turn in my favor
Sooner or later, turn in my favor
It's turning around for me
It's turning around for me
around for me around for me
around for me it's turning around for me around for me around for me
around for me it's turning around for me
around for me around for me
around for me it's turning around for me
around for me around for me
around for me it's turning around for me
around for me around for me
around for me it's turning around for me
turning around for me
turning around for me
turning around for me
turning around for me
turning around for me
turning around for me
turning around for me
It's turning around for me
it won't always be like this,
Will perfect that concerning me
Sooner or later, turn in my favor
Sooner or later, turn in my favor
