Name above names
Lamb that was slain
Beautiful God
The king above kings
God of all things
Beautiful God
And there is no other Name
Like Jesus
Give You all of the praise
Oh Lord Jesus
So let hope rise
And darkness tremble
In Your holy light
That every eye will see
Jesus our God
Great and mighty to be praised
God of all days
Glorious in all of Your ways
Majesty and wonder and grace
In the light of Your Name
