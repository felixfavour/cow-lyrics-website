After we had fallen
You opened up our hearts
And spoke in truth
The bags we had to carry
They were getting heavy
But not for you
Pre-chorus:
You took up our crosses
And you cut all our losses
And paid for our freedom in you
Chorus:
We are forgiven, covered by the blood
Of a son who was given up for us
We are your children, adopted in a love
That could take all our mess and make us clean
The darkness now behind us
Our hope inside a promise
You never leave
