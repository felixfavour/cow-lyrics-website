I found a well that I'll forever drink
Jesus Christ, the King
Forever I will worship at His feet
Here's my offering

Jehovah, Lion of Judah
Heavenly Father, here is my praise
Jehovah, Lion of Judah
Beautiful Savior, forever You reign

With praise and adoration, I will sing
To Jesus Christ (To Jesus Christ the King)
With lifted hands (With lifted hands, I give You everything)
Say here's my offering (Here's my offering)

Jehovah (Jehovah), Lion (Lion of Judah)
Heavenly Father (Heavenly Father), here is my praise (Here is my praise)

Jehovah (Jehovah), Lion of Judah (Lion of Judah)
Beautiful Savior (Beautiful Savior), forever You reign (Forever You reign)

Jehovah (Jehovah), sing Lion (Lion of Judah)
Heavenly Father (Heavenly Father), here is my praise (Here is my praise)

Say Jehovah (Jehovah), say (Lion of Judah)
Beautiful Savior (Beautiful Savior), forever You reign (Forever You reign)
