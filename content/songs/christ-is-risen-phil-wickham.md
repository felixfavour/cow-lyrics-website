Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
For I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
Hallelujah
Christ is risen from the grave
Hallelujah
Christ is risen from the grave
The prodigal is welcomed home
The sinner now a saint
For the God who died, came back to life
And everything is changed
Hallelujah
Christ is risen from the grave
Hallelujah
Christ is risen from the grave
[Bridge]
O death, where is your sting?
O fear, where is your power?
For the Mighty King of kings has disarmed you
Delivered and redeemed
Eternal life is ours
O praise His name forever
