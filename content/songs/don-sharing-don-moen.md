"Our Father" LyricsHear our prayer
We are your children and
We've gathered here today
We've gathered here to pray
Hear our cry, Lord we need your mercy
And we need your grace today
Hear us as we pray
Our father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name'
Our father hear us from heaven
Forgive our sins we pray
Hear our song
As it rises to heaven
May your glory fills the air
As the waters cover the sea
See our heart
And remove anything
That is standing in the way
Of coming to you today
Our father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name'
Our father hear us from heaven
Forgive our sins we pray
