Mary, full of innocence
Carrying the Holy prince
You're almost there, you're almost there
Mother of the Living Word
Trusting in the voice you heard
You're almost there, you're almost there
You're almost where the angels see
Redemption's plan unfolding
All hope is in the Son you'll bear
You're almost there
A lonely road, a willing heart
Pray for strength to do your part
You're almost there, you're almost there
Trust the Father to provide
Bread of heaven prophesied
You're almost there, you're almost there
You're almost where the waiting ends
Delivering the life within
The answered prayer, Emmanuel
You're almost there
You're almost where the journey ends
Where death will die and life begins
The 
answer
ed prayer, Emmanuel
You're almost, almost there
