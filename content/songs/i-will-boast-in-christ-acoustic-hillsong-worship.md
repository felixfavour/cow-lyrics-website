All I have because of Jesus
All this promise
Won for me
When He paid the highest ransom
Once for always
For my freedom
I will boast, in Christ alone
His righteousness
And not my own
I will cling to Christ my hope
His mercy reigns
Now and forever
Love will never lose its power
All our failures, could not erase
And now I walk within Your favour
Grace unending
My salvation
I will boast, in Christ alone
His righteousness
And not my own
I will cling to Christ my hope
His mercy reigns
Now and forever
