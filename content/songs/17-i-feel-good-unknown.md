I feel good, I feel good, just to know I've been redeemed, makes me feel good! I feel good, I feel good, I feel good, just to know I've been redeemed makes me feel good!

Oh, how well do I remember, all the days I spent in sin, with no thought of doing things I should. But then the blessed Savior found me and He gently took me in. Makes me want to should, Hallelujah, I feel good!

I feel good, I feel good, just to know I've been redeemed, makes me feel good! I feel good, I feel good, I feel good, just to know I've been redeemed makes me feel good!

Now I'm on my way to Heaven and I'm singing as I go. I'm so glad my name is written in the Book; and just to know His blood has cleansed me and I'm ready now to go. Makes me want to shout, Hallelujah, I feel good!

I feel good, I feel good, just to know I've been redeemed, makes me feel good! I feel good, I feel good, I feel good, just to know I've been redeemed makes me feel good!

When my traveling days are over and I reach that happy place. Everything, up there, will be just like it should. And when I step inside the City and I see my Jesus' face. I'm gonna shout, Hallelujah, I feel good!

I feel good, I feel good, just to know I've been redeemed, makes me feel good! I feel good, I feel good, I feel good, just to know I've been redeemed makes me feel good!
