I have come from so far away
Down the road of my own mistakes
In the hope you could hear me pray
Oh Lord, keep me in your reach
How I longed through these wasted years
To outrun all the pain and fear
Turned to stone from my un-cried tears
And now it's Your grace I seek
Love won't compromise
It's a gift, it's a sacrifice
My soul renewed and my heart released
In You I'll find my peace
Wondrous child of whom the angels sing
Know my joy, feel my suffering
Shining star make this love you bring
So bright that I may believe
That my way will not be lost
From now on til that river's crossed
My soul renewed and my spririt free
In you I'll find my peace
In You I'll find my peace
