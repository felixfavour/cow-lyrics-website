Oh how I've tasted Your blessings again
Here in Your presence, I call You "friend"There's more to this life than the breath that I've spent
When this story's over, another begins
When the world crashes down
And all I can do is try not to drown
I look to You, Jesus
And know death can't touch me now
I gave You hell, You gave Your Son
Hallelujah, there's nothing I've done
To deserve such a Savior, such a Father, such a love
[Interlude]
Oh, hallelujah
Hallelujah
I'm turning thе page on this life that I've livеd
You won the battle, I skipped to the end, yeah
Here in Your presence I finally can sing, woah
And I know who I am, I'm a child of the king (Yes I am)
When the world crashes down
And all I can do is try not to drown
I look to You, Jesus
And know death can't touch me now (No, it can't)
'Cause I gave You hell, You gave Your Son
Hallelujah, there's nothing I've done
To deserve such a Savior, such a Father, such a love
