Find me with open arms
Pull me towards Your heart
Swept away in the tides of Your Spirit
Your hope will not resign
Your grace cannot run dry
I will dive into You
In for all my days
In Your shadow I will remain
Oh I could stay here forever
And by Your side
I know You won't shy away
I am never forsaken
In dark and sleepless nights
To You I'm holding tight
I will rest in the depths of Your mercy
You drench my weary soul
Your Spirit overflows
Here I soak in Your love
In for all my days
In Your shadow I will remain
Oh I could stay here forever
And by Your side
I know You won't shy away
I am never forsaken
I'm covered by Your love
It's surging in my heart
Forever I am found in You my God
My feet had wandered far
But now I'm where You are
Forever I am found in You my God
I'm covered by Your love
It's surging in my heart
Forever I am found in You my God
My feet had wandered far
But now I'm where You are
Forever I am found in You my God
In for all my days
In Your shadow I will remain
Oh I could stay here forever
And by Your side
I know You won't shy away
I am never forsaken
