[Intro: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
I'll be here forever
I'll be here forever
I'll be right here with You
Right here with You forever
And I'll be seated at Your feet
To worship at Your feet
I'll be right here at Your feet
Forever
And I'll be seated at Your feet
To worship at Your feet
I'll be right here at Your feet
Forever
I'll make this vow...
And I'll be seated at Your feet
Always here to worship
(To worship at Your feet) That's where You want me, Lord....
I'll be... (I'll be right here at Your feet)
Forever (forever)
It's my favorite place...
And I... (And I'll be seated at Your feet)
To worship (To worship at Your feet)
Oh I'll be right here at Your feet
Forever (Forever)
Let's praise Him together say, I'll be seated at Your feet
(And I'll be seated at Your feet) That's where You want me, Lord
(To worship at Your feet) So that's where...
I'll be... (I'll be right here at Your feet)
Forever (forever)
Somebody tell Him, I'll be seated here, Lord
(And I'll be seated at Your feet)
I'm always here to worship (To worship at Your feet)
Oh-ooh I'll be right here, I'll be here... (I'll be right here at Your feet)
Forever (forever)
