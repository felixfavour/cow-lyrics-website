[Intro]
See, it's important to understand
That just because God allows things that may not be good to us
Does not mean that's it's not good for us, yeah
See, a parent fails if a child never learns how to fly
I hope I'm talking to somebody today
I can feel that it won't be long
I see how my life could have gone wrong
Every time you delay my dreams, you were protecting me
All these are to make me strong (Hit me)
I can see that you have a plan
That I won't always understand
Even when I go my own way, you allow my mistakes
But still, hold on to my hand (Thank you)
Oh, that's what real fathers do
I wouldn't expect nothing less from you (Hey)
See, it's alright to not always understand why
Let Him in, bring tears from your eyes (Feels good)
But God, your ways are better than mine (Take a look at my heart)
So whatever you see, keep working on me
(I just have one request)
Promise me you'll hold me close, don't ever let me go
Hold me close, don't let me go (Please)
Ooh, hold me close, don't let me go (Hey, one more time)
