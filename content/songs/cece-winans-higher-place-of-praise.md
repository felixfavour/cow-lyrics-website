Now there's a place that's blessed, where we find happiness a place of savid rest a higher place of praise(praise) praise(praise)
we lift our hands up we learn to thank you sing without the motion and now we're going through the lotion now tell me really is that victory tell me.
But there's a place I found ya so much higher mountain it wakes me early morning and I know its now you calling me into worship to give me life daily daily.
