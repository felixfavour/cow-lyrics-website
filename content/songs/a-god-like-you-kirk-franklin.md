Hit me
How y'all doing this evening?
How y'all doing this evening?
Do y'all want that bounce?
Do y'all want that bounce?
I said: Do y'all want that bounce?
That bounce?
Everybody wanna be like you they
Want power and praise like you but
See there is no god (no god) like our God
(Like our God)
There's no one like
Who gave their life like You and
Who payed our price like You see
There's only one god that's our God
There's no one like You
Who can touch like You
Or heal us like You do
We stubble and we stray
Til' You always get us thru
Who makes all things new
And comes to our rescue
Death, hell, and the grave
(They could not) They could not conquer
