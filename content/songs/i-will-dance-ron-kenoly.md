In the morning when I rise
I will lift up my eyes and behold I will dance
In the morning when I rise
I will lift up my eyes and behold I will dance
In the morning when I rise
I will lift up my eyes and behold I will dance
In the morning when I rise
I will lift up my eyes and behold I will dance
Jesus lifted all my burdens
And He washed all my sins away
And then He took this earthen body
And He made it His dwelling place, yeah
In the morning when I rise
I will lift up my eyes and behold I will dance
In the morning when I rise
I will lift up my eyes and behold I will dance
In the morning when I rise
I will lift up my eyes and behold I will dance
In the morning when I rise
I will lift up my eyes and behold I will dance
Jesus lifted all my burdens
He washed all my sins away
And then He took this earthen body
He made it His dwelling place
