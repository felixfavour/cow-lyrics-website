Turn my heart to You, O God
Remind me of Your promise
You restore what I have lost
Draw me near
Never-failing comforter
My present help in trouble
Though the earth gives way beneath
You are here
Everlasting Father
Enduring love forever
Your kindness makes me stronger
You run to me
You run to me
Even when I wander far
Your presence never leaves me
Your voice of mercy calls me home
Draws me close
Everlasting Father
Enduring love forever
Your kindness makes me stronger
You run to me
You run to me
