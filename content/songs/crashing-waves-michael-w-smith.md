My heart is beating loud, in perfect rhythm
There's beauty all around, that once was hidden!
Waves crash all around me!
Broken is how You found me
I'm heavy like a stone, don't want to be alone now
The past is all I see, fading memories!
Somebody hid the sun, in the midnight of suffering
My tears are falling down, and crashing like waves
Somebody stole the day, and took Your light from me
I'll never be the same, roll this stone away
My heart is beating fast, loud and clearer
The promises at last, are coming nearer!
Waves crash all around me! Oh-ooh!
Broken is how You found me!
I'm heavy like a stone, don't want to be alone now
Will this pain ever be, a fading memory?!
Somebody hid the sun, in the midnight of suffering
My tears are falling down, and crashing like waves
Somebody stole the day, and took Your light from me
I'll never be the same, roll this stone away
