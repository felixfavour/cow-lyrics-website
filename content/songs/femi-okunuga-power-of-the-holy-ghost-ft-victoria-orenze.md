It's not by Power
It's not by might
But by My Spirit
Says The Lord
The same Power of Jesus
Is at work in me
Is at work in me
Greater is He that lives in me
Than he that lives in the world
The Power of the Holy Ghost
That same Spirit that raised Christ from the dead
Dwells in me richly
Dwells in me richly
Dwells in me richly
