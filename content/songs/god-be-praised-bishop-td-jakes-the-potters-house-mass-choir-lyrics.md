[Chorus:]
God be praised.
God be praised,
Let the name of the Lord be praised.

Oh Oh Oh Oh God be praised.
God be praised,
Let the name of the Lord be praised.

[Verse:]
From the rising of the sun,
To the setting of the same,
Let the name of the Lord be praised.
And until my dying day,
When there's no more I can say,
Let the name of the Lord be praised.

[Bridge:]
Praise ye the Lord,
Praise God in His sanctuary,
Praise Him in the firmament of His power.

Oh Oh Oh Oh praise ye the Lord,
Praise God in His sanctuary,
Praise Him, praise Him,
Praise ye the Lord.
