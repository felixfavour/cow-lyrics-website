While traveling thru this world below, I see great cities everywhere I go but I know that soon their beauty will fade away. But there's a place waiting just for me, a city that'll stand for eternity. I'm telling you the place where I'm going is out of this world. 

It's out of this world, out of this world. I'm telling you, the place where I'm going is out of this world. No more sorrow, no more fears, no more dying, no more tears, the river of life is flowing by, where we'll never have to say goodbye. 

John saw that city coming down, dressed like a bride in her wedding gown, he said that the walls are made of jasper, the gates of pear. Where once again God walks with man and dries their tears with his own hand. I'm telling you the place where I' going is out of this world. 

It's out of this world, out of this world. I'm telling you, the place where I'm going is out of this world. No more sorrow, no more fears, no more dying, no more tears, the river of life is flowing by, where we'll never have to say goodbye.
