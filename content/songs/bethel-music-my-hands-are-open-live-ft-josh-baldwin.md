I wanna move so You can move
Come and do what only You can do
I wanna live in expectation
Of Your kingdom breaking through
I wanna move so You can move
Come and do what only You can do
I wanna live in expectation
Of Your kingdom breaking through
My hands
My hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
My hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
And I wanna come to You in boldness
By Your power, I receive
I wanna live in expectation
With You, I'll do greater things
'Cause I believe in greater things
Yeah, my hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
My hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
'Til all that overwhelms, is overwhelmed by You
And every soul has seen what You can do
A holy visitation, where everything is changing
There's no empty spaces when You move
'Cause my hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
Sing it out
My hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
My hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
My hands are open, and my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me, yeah
Rain down on me, fall down on me, oh-oh
'Cause my hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
My hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
