e spirit of the Lord is moving
And he is here with His power, his anointing and grace
There is glory and there is favor
This is the hour
its time to arise
So be blessed
Be changed
For your the time is now
Lift up your hands and say am blessed
Am changed
For my time is now
My time is now
Wherever you are
It doesn't matter what you are going
You gat to step up on your feet right now
And begin to praise God right now
For anything is possible
It doesn't matter what you are going through
It doesn't matter how far you have gone
Gods arms are always open wide
All you need is to believe
