What kind of love is this
Greater than all I've seen
Perfection bends to kiss
Unworthiness like me
Here I stand forgiven
You stepped into my dark
Suffered the sinner's cross
Rescued my hopeless heart
You paid the highest cost
Here I stand forgiven
For God so loved the world He gave His
One and Only Son
Amazing grace, my debt is paid
Oh, praise the Risen One
For God so loved
For God so loved
Stronger than any grave
Greater than every sin
Nothing can separate us
Your love will never end
Here I stand forgiven
