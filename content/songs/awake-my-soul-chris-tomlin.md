Breathe on me, breath of God, breathe on me
Breathe on me, breath of God, breathe on me
I come alive, I’m alive when You breathe on me
I come alive, I’m alive when You breathe on me
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin]
Awake, awake, awake my soul
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, for You alone
Awake my soul
Speak to me, word of God, speak to me
Speak to me, word of God, speak to me
I come alive, I’m alive when You speak to me
I come alive, I’m alive when You speak to me
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin]
Awake, awake, awake my soul
God resurrect these bones
From death to life, for You alone
Awake my soul
[Interlude: Lecrae]
Then He said to me
Prophesy to these bones and say to them
Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord!
This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones
I will make breath enter you
And you will come to life
So I prophesied as I was commanded
As I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound
And the bones came together, bone to bone
And I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them
And skin covered them, but there was no breath in them
Then He said to me
Prophesy to the breath
Prophesy, son of man, and say to it
Conjure the four winds of breath and breathe
