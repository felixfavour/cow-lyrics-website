You have my heart
And i am yours forever
You are my strength
God of grace and power
And everything you hold in your hand
Still you make time for me
I can't understand
Praise you god of earth and sky
How beautiful is your unfailing love
Unfailing love
And you never change god you remain
The holy one
My unfailing love
Unfailing love
You are my rock
The one i hold on to
You are my song
And i sing for you
[Chorus][x2]
[Outro]
I will praise you
Praise you god of earth and sky
How beautiful is your unfailing love
Unfailing love
And you never change god you remain
The holy one
My unfailing love
Unfailing love
Unfailing love
Unfailing love
Unfailing love
Unfailing love
