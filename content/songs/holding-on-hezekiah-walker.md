I'm holding on
I've come too far to turn back now
I'm pressing on through all my pain
I will be strong
I'm holding on
I've come too far to turn back now
I'm pressing on through all my pain
I will be strong
See nobody knows what I've been through my issues
Many days I was lost I was drifting drifting
He wrapped me in his arms kept me safe from all harm
And you know that his grace is sufficient
For me
I know I am free
I'm holding on
I've come too far to turn back now
I'm pressing on through all my pain
I will be strong
I'm holding on
I've come too far to turn back now
I'm pressing on through all my pain
I will be strong
See nobody knows what I've been through, my issues
Many days I was lost I was drifting drifting
He wrapped me in his arms kept me safe from all harm
And you know that his grace is sufficient
For me
I know I am free
