Where can I go from Your Spirit?
How can I escape Your love?
Your love for me is deeper than the sea
And higher than the heavens above
Where can I flee from Your Presence?
Now that You abide in my heart
My heart is your home, your temple, your throne
So what could ever keep us apart?
Your love is higher than the heavens
Your love is deeper than the ocean
Nothing in creation can take me away
From Your love
Your lovе, there is nothing greatеr
Your love, there is nothing stronger
You came to me, gave your life
So I could be free
Who can explain Your Mercy?
Who can comprehend Your Ways?
You showed me Your grace by taking my place
And washing all my sorrow away
I just want to live in Your Presence
Worship You with all of my heart
Show me the way, draw me closer each day
Don’t let anything keep us apart
