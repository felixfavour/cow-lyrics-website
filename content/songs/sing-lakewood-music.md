Now is the time for all people
From ev'ry land to come together
Now is the moment for worship
We enter in withholding nothing
He's (You're) worthy exalted
He's (You're) high and lifted up
Sing
Sing unto the Lord
Open up your heart
Make a joyful noise
In the sanctuary
Sing
Sing unto the Lord
Lavish Him with love
Let the praises ring
In the sanctuary
Sing
[Bridge]
Gotta open up your mouth and give Him praise
Open up your heart and give Him praise
Lift up holy hands unashamed
In the sanctuary
Gotta open up your mouth and give Him praise
Open up your heart and give Him praise
Lift up holy hands unashamed
Sing sing sing
