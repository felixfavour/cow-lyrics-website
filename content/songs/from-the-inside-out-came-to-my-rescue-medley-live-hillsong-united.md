A thousand times I've failed, Your mercy remains
Should I stumble again, I'm caught in Your grace everlasting
Your light will shine when all else fades
Never-ending
Your glory goes beyond all fame
Yeah, in my heart and my soul
I give You control
Consume me from the inside out
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love you from the inside out (Come on, life your voice)
Everlasting, Your light will shine whеn all else fades
Nеver ending, Your glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise
From the inside out, oh, my soul cries out
In my heart and my soul
Lord, I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord (Oh)
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love you from the inside out
Everlasting, Your light will shine when all else fades
Never ending, Your glory goes beyond all fame
And the cry of my heart is to bring You praise
From the inside out, oh, my soul cries out
From the inside out, oh, my soul cries out
