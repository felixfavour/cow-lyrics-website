Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord 
Praise the Lord
Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord

I'll praise in the valley
Praise on the mountain 
I'll praise when I'm sure
And praise when I'm doubting 

I'll praise when outnumbered
Praise when surrounded
'Cause praise is the water
My enemies drown in

As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul (c'mon)
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul (hey)

I'll praise when I feel it
And I'll praise when I don't
I'll praise 'cause I know
You're still in control

Because my praise is a weapon
It's more than a sound (more than a sound)
Oh, my praise is the shout
That brings Jericho down (oh)

As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to
Praise the Lord (c'mon)
Oh, my soul
(So I'm gonna) praise the Lord
Oh, my soul (oh)

I won't be quiet, my God is alive
So how could I keep it inside?
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign
Praise 'cause You reign
Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave
I'll praise 'cause You're faithful
Praise 'cause You're true
Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You, I'll praise

I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign
Praise 'cause You reign
Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave

I'll praise 'cause You're faithful
Praise 'cause You're true
Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You

Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul 
I gotta praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul 
I gotta praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside?

I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside?

I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside?

Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord

Let everything 
That has breath 
Praise the Lord
