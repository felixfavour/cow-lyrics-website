Hungry I come to you
For I know
You satisfy
I am empty but I know Your love
Does not run dry
So I wait
For you
So I wait
For You
I'm falling on my knees
Offering all of me
Jesus, You're all this heart is living for
Broken I run to You
For Your arms
Are open wide
I am weary but I know Your touch
Restores my life
So I wait
For you
So I wait
For You
