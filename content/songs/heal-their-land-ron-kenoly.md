If My people
Who are called
By My name
Would humble themselves
And pray
And turn from their wicked ways
If My people
Who are called by My name
Would humble themselves
And pray
And purpose to seek My face
If My people
Who are called by My name
Would humble themselves
And pray
And turn from their wicked ways
I will hear from Heaven
I will hear from Heaven
I will hear from Heaven
I'll hear and I'll heal their land
If God's people
Who are called by His Name
If they will humble themselves
And pray
And purpose to seek His face
If God's people
Who are called by His Name
If they will humble themselves
And pray
And turn from their wicked ways
