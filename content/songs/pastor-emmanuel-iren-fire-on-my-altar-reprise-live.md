Thank you Lord
There is fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
I put fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
If Elijah called it I can
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
No more mediocrity
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Say I'm burning
Burning
Mean it, burning
Burning
Burning
Burning
I call fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
I'm on fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
There is fire and I'm burning, say
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Thank you Jesus
Pray in the spirit right now, worship him.
Speaks in tongues
What you sang are not mere words
They are not mere words
They are your experience
He answers by fire
Though that of Elijah was for destruction
Yours is for fervor
Rise in fervor
As you step into the week right now
One more time
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
There is fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Say I'm burning
Burning
Burning
Burning
Burning
Burning
Say I'm on fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire
There is fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Speaks in tongues
Fire on my altar
Fire on my altar
Thank you Lord, hallelujah
Fire on my altar
Today, I want you to spend time praying
Remember you're a friend of God
