We worship the God who was
We worship the God who is
We worship the God who evermore will be
[Pre-Chorus]
He opened the prison doors
He parted the raging sea
My God, He holds the victory, yeah
There's joy in the house of the Lord
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise
There's joy in the house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this placе
And we won't be quiet
Wе shout out Your praise (Oh)
