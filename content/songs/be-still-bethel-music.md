Be still my heart and know, You are God alone
Stop thinking so much, and just let go
Be still my soul and rest, humbly I confess
In my weakness, Your strength is perfect
For You alone are God, there will be no other
And You have won my heart, more than any other
So I will give it all, 'cause You gave it all for me
Be still my heart and know, You are God alone
Stop thinking so much, and just let go
Be still my soul and rest, humbly I confess
In my weakness, Your strength is perfect
For You alone are God, there will be no other
And You have won my heart, more than any other
So I will give it all, 'cause You gave it all for me
For You alone are God, there will be no other
And You have won my heart, more than any other
So I will give it all, 'cause You gave it all for me
