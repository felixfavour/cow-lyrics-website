My home is where You are
Your doors are open wide
Your presence pulls my heart
Invited by Your smile
Finally I can breathe
You're breathing life in me
We're standing face to face
You welcome me to stay
It feels like home
It feels like home when I'm with You
It feels like home
Here in your love is where I belong
Your presence is home
You never run away
Though I have run before
From You I can't escape
My heart is tied to Yours
And like the prodigal
You look beyond my faults
You take me by my hand
Back to Your heart again
