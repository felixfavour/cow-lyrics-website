We need no other hiding place
Our hope is safe within Your name
This we know, this we know
You promised never to forsake
What You began You will sustain
This we know, this we know
I will call upon the Lord
For He alone is strong enough to save
Rise, your shackles are no more
For Jesus Christ has broken every chain
All of the heavens and the earth
Announce the fullness of Your worth
This we know, this we know
And every enemy will flee
As we declare Your victory
This we know, this we know
I will call upon the Lord
For He alone is strong enough to save
Rise, your shackles are no more
For Jesus Christ has broken every chain
I will call upon the Lord
For He alone is strong enough to save
Rise, your shackles are no more
For Jesus Christ has broken every chain
