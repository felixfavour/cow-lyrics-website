Children in the wilderness
Following the love You poured out for us
Covered by the Name that we confess
Jesus Saviour forever
Roaming through the dark of night
Clinging to the word that burns deep inside
Eyes fixed on Your Name and endless light
Jesus Saviour forever
Set alight to follow
In the shadow of Your Name
The world is Yours and I know
Everything will find its place
Under Your Name
Walking on through the fire
Knowing I will not be burned but refined
Fearless in Your Name ever by my side
Jesus Saviour forever
Taking on the raging storm
Anchored to the kingdom unshakable
Holding to Your Name that outshines all
Jesus Saviour forever
