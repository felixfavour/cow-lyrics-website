If I could have your attention
Don't mean to waste your time
I'd like to tell a little story
How I was lost and couldn't find my way
Then I met Jesus
Something started to change
I ain't proud of the past
I'm proud of the fact that I'm not who I was now
I am different now
Every part of me
Has been touched by freedom
Oh Jesus, Ya gotta hold on me
I fell but somehow
You refused to leave
Now all my wrong forgiven
Oh Jesus, Ya gotta hold on me
Born in North Carolina
Outside the county lines
Yea, I came up in the struggle
And on the streets I had to find my way
But that was just a chapter
It was not the end
I ain't proud of the past
But I'm proud of the fact that I'm not who I was now
I am different now
Every part of me
Has been touched by freedom
Oh Jesus, Ya gotta hold on me
I fell but somehow
You refused to leave
Now all my wrong forgiven
Oh Jesus, Ya gotta hold on me
No matter what comes or goes
One thing is for sure
You won't let me go
You got a hold on me
And when I'm losing control
You're dependable
No, you won't let go
You got a hold on me
No matter what comes or goes
One thing is for sure
You won't let me go
You got a hold on me
And when I'm losing control
You're dependable
No, you won't let go
You got a hold on me
We want to thank Travis and Jon for stopping by the service this evening
We'll be serving plate dinners in the back
Come and get you some red Kool-Aid because you know you've been changed
Hallelujah
See, it feels real good right now
Now I want to talk to you a little bit more
I'm not finished with you, talk to em
I used to fall asleep in Sunday school
Sang in the choir so I could sit right next to you, yeah
Puppy love, but see now I forget your name
Cuz after time, memories they fade away
But still the day I could never let it go
That Sunday morning when I met the Holy Ghost
On my mama, church boy, now I'll never be the same
Jesus paid it all and told me I could keep the change
