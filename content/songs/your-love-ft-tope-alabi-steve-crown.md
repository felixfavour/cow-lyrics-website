Soo Lost
In the Middle of Nowhere
With no One to Run to
Until your Grace Found me
Soo Deep
In my Guilt and my shame
Till your Love came
And Found me
Now I am Free

For your Love never End
Yes your Love never End
Now I am Free
Free to Worship You
I'm the Apple of your Eyes
Thought that Fills your heart
I'm Forever yours
And You're Forever Mine

Nibata ye somi , Soki ti ogor
Asor ati Ofo aye
To shebi eni kpeon dor
Oro wata lumoni iyi nre
Ti'rini sogun egwe, Nikon, nimori
Okpe Onife alay'ile gbe
The Love that never Ends
Owulo fani yanhe
Sinu oro igbayi iya kaye to'mbor
I am Predestined,
Called Justified,
Love that never Ends
Has made me Victorious
Glorified, Accomplished, Fortified,
Finished work of the Cross
Ikoto ati dagere aye
Wa domu kokpe O

For your Love never End
Yes your Love never End
Now I am Free
Free to Worship You
I'm the Apple of your Eyes
Thought that Fills your heart
I'm Forever yours
And You're Forever Mine
And You're Forever Mine
I'm Forever yours

For your Love never End
Yes your Love never End
I'm Forever yours
And You're Forever Mine
