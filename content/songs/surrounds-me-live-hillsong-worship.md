You have searched my heart, oh God
You have known my ways
Every detail and every thought
You reveal Your grace
And call me deeper
So, You will be the one I trust
You will be the one I love
Your goodness surrounds me
Your goodness surrounds me
You will never leave my side
You will never change Your mind
Your goodness surrounds me
Your goodness surrounds me
If the night brings a troubled heart
Will You meet me there
You light up every road I run
All Your plans are good
Youâ€™re always faithful
So, You will be the one I trust
You will be the one I love
Your goodness surrounds me
Your goodness surrounds me
