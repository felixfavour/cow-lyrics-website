As long as there is air to breathe
As long as there is life in me
While the river runs into the sea
I will give you praise
While the rain drops from the sky
And the sunlight beams down from on high
While the lion roars and birds can fly
I will give you praise
From the rising of the sun
To the setting of the same
Lord I'll lift my voice
I'll sing praises to your name
King of glory
I'll worship you endlessly
For that's what you've created me to be
As long as there is air to brеathe
As long as there is lifе in me
While the river runs into the sea
I will give you praise
While the rain drops from the sky
And the sunlight beams down from on high
While the lion roars and birds can fly
I will give you praise
