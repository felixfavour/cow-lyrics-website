He accepts you at your worst
And He is hoping for the best
Jesus loves you
Jesus loves you
He will never ever leave you
And He will never ever forsake you
Jesus loves you
Jesus loves you
He is proud of who your are
And He has faith in who you'll become
He is not like us
He loves you just because
He is not like us
He loves you just because
Broken hearted do you want your healing
Oh, trust again there is love in His Right Hand
Oh, trust again there is love in His Right Hand
He believes your dreams are true
And what a plan He has for you
Jesus loves you
Jesus loves you
When you want to walk away
He is asking you to stay
Jesus loves you
Jesus loves you
You will never be alone
He makes your heart His loving Home
He is not like us
He loves you just because
He is not like us
He loves you just because
Broken hearted do you want your healing
Oh, trust again there is love in His Right Hand
Oh, trust again there is love in His Right Hand
