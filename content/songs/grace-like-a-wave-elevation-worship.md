You have brought me to the water
Where my past can be swept away
In the current of Your mercy
And I know Iâ€™ll never be the same
There's no limit to Your promise
Jesus, You have done it all for me
Jesus, You have done it all for me
Grace comes like a wave
Crashing over me
Grace comes like a wave
Crashing over and over and over
I will jump into the water
Where my soul can be satisfied
And your love is overflowing
From within me and it won't run dry
There's no limit to Your promise
Jesus, You have done it all for me
Jesus, You have done it all for me
Grace comes like a wave
Crashing over me
Grace comes like a wave
Crashing over and over and over
Grace comes like a wave
Crashing over me
Grace comes like a wave
Crashing over and over and over
