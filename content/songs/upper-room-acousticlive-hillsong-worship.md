Help me, Holy Ghost
I need You more than anything
All my best ideas are Yours
So what am I but what You make of me?
So help me, God, breathe on my weakness
For all I want is to be like Jesus
And I don't have much, but what I have is Yours to use
So make my whole life Your upper room
Help me, Holy Ghost
I need You more than I can say
May Your thoughts become my own
Till the Father's will be done in me
So help me, God, breathe on my weakness
For all I want is to be like Jesus
I don't have much, but what I have is Yours to use
So make my whole life Your upper room
[Post-Chorus]
Breathe in me
Your breath, Your life, oh, God
Oh-oh
Ooh-ooh
