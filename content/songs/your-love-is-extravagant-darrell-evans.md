Your love
Is extravagant
Your friendship
Mmm, intimate
[Pre-Chorus]
I find I'm moving to the rhythms of Your grace
Your fragrance is intoxicating in our secret place
Your love
Is extravagant
Spread wide in the arms of Christ
Is the love that covers sin
No greater love have I ever known
You considered me a friend
Capture my heart again
Capture my heart again
Your love (Your love)
Is extravagant
Your friendship
Mmm, intimate
