If you're getting tired of losing life's war and you keep searching for Something worth fighting for Well, God's got an army We've been proved and tried So come on over to the winning side.

Come on over to the winning side.
We're following Jesus We've got our banner held high We're God's mighty army We'll not be denied So come on over to the winning side.

We marched through the fire But the fire wouldn't burn...oh no We marched through the water, Pharaoh just  wouldn't learn. And marched through the lion's den And ol' Daniel replied
These lion's can't hurt me, Cause I'm on the wining side

Come on over to the winning side.
We're following Jesus We've got our banner held high We're God's mighty army We'll not be denied So come on over to the winning side.
