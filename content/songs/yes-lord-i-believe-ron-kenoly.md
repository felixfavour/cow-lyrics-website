Yes Lord, Yes Lord I believe
Yes Lord, I believe You're alive in me
I'm gonna shout aloud to the Rock
The Rock of my salvation
Yes Lord, yes Lord I believe
I believe the tomb is empty
'Cause I know my heart is full
Of the glory and the wonder of Your Name
I believe the power that raised You
Is alive in me right now
And the joy within my heart can't be contained
Yes Lord, Yes Lord I believe
Yes Lord, I believe You're alive in me
I'm gonna shout aloud to the Rock
The Rock of my salvation
Yes Lord
Yes Lord, Yes Lord
Yes Lord, Yes Lord
Yes Lord, I believe
Yes Lord (repeat)
I'm gonna shout
Aloud to the Rock
The Rock of my salvation
Yes Lord, Yes Lord
Yes Lord, Yes Lord
Yes Lord, yes Lord I believe
