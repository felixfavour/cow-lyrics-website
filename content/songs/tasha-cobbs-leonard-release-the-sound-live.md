Release The Sound"
David faced a giant that mocked the living God
By faith he stood in power and that giant had to fall
The Israelite people rivaled by a wall
But when the people shouted that wall it had to fall
'Cause there is a sound that makes walls fall down
There is a sound that makes walls fall down
There is a sound that makes walls fall down
I command you
Release the sound
Release the sound
Hey, you got it
Release the sound
I got another one
What about Paul and Silas behind the prison walls
But when they started singing those walls they had to fall
'Cause there is a sound that makes walls fall down
There is a sound that makes walls fall down
There is a sound that makes walls fall down
(Release the sound)
Release the sound (Release the sound)
Release the sound (Release the sound)
I got one more, y'all
The crucified Jesus was buried in a tomb
They thought His life was over, but three days revealed the truth
The resurrected Jesus He's coming with the clouds
Every eye will see Him and every knee will bow
'Cause there is a name that makes demons flee (That makes demons flee)
There is a name (There is a name)
That makes demons flee (That makes demons flee)
There is a name (There is a name)
That makes demons flee (That makes demons flee)
Somebody, release the name (Release the name)
I command you, release the name (Release the name)
Command you, release the name (Release the name)
Release it in your home
Jesus (Release the name)
Command you, in your home
Release the name (Release the name)
Over your body, I command you
Release the name (Release the name)
Oh command you
Release the name (Release the name)
Release the name (Release the name)
Release the name
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
Somebody, release the name
