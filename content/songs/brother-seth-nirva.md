When I look into the face of my enemy
I see my brother, I see my brother
When I look into the face of my enemy
I see my brother,
 I see my 
brother, yeah
[Interlude: Seth 
& Nirva
]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yea-ee-eah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yea-ee-eah
[Chorus: Seth & Nirva]
When I look into the face of my enemy
I see my brother, I see my brother
When I look into the face of my enemy
I see my brother, I see my brother
[Bridge: Nirva 
& Seth

]
Forgiveness is the garment of our courage
The power to make the peace we long to know
Open up our eyes
To see the wounds that bind all of humankind
May our shutter hearts
Greet the dawn of life with charity and love
 
(Oh)
[Chorus: TobyMac]
Yeah, when I look into the face of my enemy
I see my brother, I see my brother
When I look into the face of my enemy
I see my brother, I see my brother
