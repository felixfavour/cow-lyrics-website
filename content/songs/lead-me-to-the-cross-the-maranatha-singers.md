Savior I come
I quiet my soul
Remember
Redemption's hill
Where Your blood was spilled
For my ransom
And everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost
Lead me to the cross where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord, I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me
Lead me to the cross
You were as I
Tempted and trialed
Human
Word became flesh
Bore my sin and death
Now You're risen
And everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost
