How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great, is our God
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great, is our God
The splendor of a King
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
Let all the earth rejoice
He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
It trembles at His voice
It trembles at His voice
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great, is our God
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great, is our God
Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great, is our God
(With music)
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God and all will see
How great, how great is our God
(Again)
