My life is like a racing car
Hurtling towards the wall
At the speed of sound
My time has been so finely tuned
But I've never seen a human being
So tightly wound
At times it seems beyond belief
I just need a bit of relief
Like a war-weary soldier
Marching up and over the edge
Take my hand and pull me up
'Cause I'm falling too fast
Somehow I've lost my way
I'm cryin' save me
Can You hear me? I'm calling out
I'm crying out, a cry for love
I can feel You, You're touching me
You're healing me, my cry for love
I will be the first to admit
I don't have strength
To handle it alone anymore
