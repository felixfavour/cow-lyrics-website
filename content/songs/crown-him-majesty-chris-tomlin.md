Crown Him with many crowns
The lamb upon His throne
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own;
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for me
And hail him as thy matchless king
Through all eternity
Majesty, Lord of all
Let every throne before Him fall
The King of kings, O come adore
Our God who reigns forevermore!
Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save;
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die
