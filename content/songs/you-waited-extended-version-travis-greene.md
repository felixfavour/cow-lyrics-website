You came out of your way
You sat down to speak to me
What amazing grace
That you've shown – so patiently
And you, waited for me
Just for me
For me
You called out my name
Knew my past
Covered my shame
This amazing grace
You’ve shown – so patiently
And You, you waited for me
Just for me, Oh
You, you waited for me
Just for me, for me
Bridge:
Where would I be
If you left me God
