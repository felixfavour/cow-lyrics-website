I ask for things that I think that I need
I get frustrated when you disagree
And you're always listening closely to me
But there is a limit to what I can see
So I'm not asking for an outcome
Or praying for results
I'm not hoping that it all goes
Exactly how I want
No I'm not asking you to do it
Or asking that you don't
I'm just inviting you to my situation
Come thru 'cause I want you in my situation
I'm just inviting you
In my situation
(I need thee oh, I need thee oh)
You see the big picture
You hold the frame
Past, present and future
You see the same
I know that it's very human
To want everything my way
But if I don't get what I pray for
My hope is in your name
So I'm not asking for an outcome
Or praying for results
I'm not hoping that it all goes
Exactly how I want
No I'm not asking you to do it
Or asking that you don't
I'm just inviting you to my situation
Come thru 'cause I want you in my situation
I'm just inviting you
In my situation
I'm just inviting you to my situation
Come thru 'cause I want you in my situation
I'm just inviting you
In my situation
I just want you
I just want you hear with me, Lord
I just want you
I just want you hear with me, Lord
I just want you
I just want you hear with me, Lord
I just want you
I just want you hear with me, Lord
I'm just inviting you to my situation
Come thru 'cause I want you in my situation
I'm just inviting you, Jesus
In my situation
