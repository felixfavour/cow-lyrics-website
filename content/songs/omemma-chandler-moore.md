Omemma (always)
Always on time (You can't)
You can do no wrong
Omemma (You leave)
Leave the 99, always for the one

I know He loves me, I know He cares
Whenever I call, He always is right there
In times of trouble, He is my help
Yeah, I know no fear
I know He'll be right there

Ay, He really does what He says He will do
My God really moves, oh
Ay, why would I doubt when He always comes through?
My God really moves, oh

He really, really moves, oh

I know He loves me (I know He loves me)
I know He cares (I know He cares) whenever
Whenever I call, He always is right there

When I'm in trouble (when I'm in trouble)
He is my help (He is my help)
Yeah, I know no fear, I know He'll be right there (come on, we say)

Ay, He really does what He says He will do
My God really moves, oh (whoa-oh-oh)

Ay, why would I doubt when He always comes through?
My God really moves, oh
Oh, ay, He really does what He says He will do
My God really moves, oh (Baba)
Ay (Baba, Baba), why would I doubt when He always comes through?
My God really moves, oh
