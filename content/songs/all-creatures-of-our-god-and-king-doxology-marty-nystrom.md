All creatures of our God and King
Lift up your voice and with us sing
Alleluia, alleluia
Thou burning sun with golden beam
Thou silver moon with softer gleam
O praise Him, O praise Him
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia
Thou rushing wind that art so strong
Ye clouds that sail in heaven along
O praise Him, alleluia
Thou rising morn in praise rejoice
Ye lights of evening find a voice
O praise Him, O praise Him
Alleluia, alleluia
Allelu-alleluia
Praise God from whom
All blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him abovе Ye Heavenly host
Praisе Father, Son and Holy Ghost
And all ye men with tender heart
Forgiving others, take your part
O sing out, Alleluia
Praise, Praise the Father
Praise the Son
And praise the Spirit
Three in One
O praise Him, O praise Him
Alleluia, alleluia
Allelu-alleluia
