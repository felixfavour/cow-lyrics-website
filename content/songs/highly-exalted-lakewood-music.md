Glory to God in the highest
Glory to God in the highest place
You are the Lord God Almighty
You are highly exalted over all the earth
You are great and glorious
Ever watching over us
Majestic and so marvelous

We declare You're wonderful
Passionate and powerful
Father forever You are faithful

Highly exalted highly exalted
[Bridge 2]
Mighty mighty in battle oh Lord
You are mighty
There's no other name stronger
You are mighty
Mighty in battle oh Lord
