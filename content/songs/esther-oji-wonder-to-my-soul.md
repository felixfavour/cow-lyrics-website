Wonder to My Soul Lyrics by Esther Oji
Spoken:
We give you glory Jesus, You are a good good father
I have seen Your mighty works x2
Creation speaks of Your greatness
You are good, I can testify
You've done miracles, before my very eyes
You never change, Faithful are You
God from ages past, You're the God of Today
Refrain:
You're a wonder to my soul, Jesus
You're a wonder to my soul, Jesus
You're a Wonder-Working Wonder, Jesus
You're a wonder to my soul, Jesus
(From the Top)
When men thought it was over; You said You've just started
You never sleep nor slumber, You're constantly watching
See how You set me free, see how You changed my life
When death showed its face o, see how You rescued me
See how You set me free (How You set me free)
You keep changing things for my Good (How You changed my life)
Even death showed its ugly face o, see how You rescued me
You will never left my eyes see shame
You will never let Your own see disgrace
You are Wonder x4
(Refrain)
You are a wonder, Wonder nYou are always on time x2
You never leave me stranded x2
You always show up, whenever we call you
You are a wonder, wonder-working God
Of all people in the earth, you know my name (How You set me free)
You have called me Your own (How You changed my life)
The things you do, the things You do are amazing x2
You are a wonder to my soul, You will forever be a wonder to me
Even the angels are in awe of you
Day and night they bow down, singing Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord God Almighty
Who was, and is, and is to come
You are beautiful beyond description, Jesus
You are beautiful beyond description
You are a wonder, a wonder to my soul, Jesus
