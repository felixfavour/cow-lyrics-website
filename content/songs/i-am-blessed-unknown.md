I am blessed, I am blessed. Every day that I live I am blessed. When I wake up in the morning, till I lay my head to rest, I am blessed, I am blessed.

Through the sunshine and rain, even sorrows and pain, Jesus is still my comfort and my guide. And His love comforts me and His grace has set me free, and someday I shall stand by His side. 

I am blessed, I am blessed. Every day that I live I am blessed. When I wake up in the morning, till I lay my head to rest. I am blessed, I am blessed.

I have shoes on my feet, I have plenty to eat and a home in Heaven by and by. Brothers and sisters on this earth, they are mine by my new birth, and we shall share in that home beyond the sky.

I am blessed, I am blessed. Every day that I live I am blessed. When I wake up in the morning, till I lay my head to rest. I am blessed, I am blessed.
