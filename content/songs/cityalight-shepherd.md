Though I walk through the valley
And I can't see the way
When the shadows surround me
I will not be afraid
For I know You are with me
You will always provide
Though the path may be lonely
You will stay by my side
I will rest my soul
I'll trust in You alone
For the Lord my Shepherd
Leads me, leads me
And He is all I need
In the darkest valley
I know, I know
My Shepherd is all I need
Lord I know that You seek me
When I'm trying to hide
And Your love it pursues me
All the days of my life
I will rest my soul
I'll trust in You alone
For the Lord my Shepherd
Leads me, leads me
And He is all I need
In the darkest valley
I know, I know
My Shepherd is all I need
I rest my soul
In You alone
You light my way
You lead me on
I rest my soul
In You alone
You light my way
You lead me on
For the Lord my Shepherd
Leads me, leads me
And He is all I need
In the darkest valley
I know, I know
My Shepherd is all I need
