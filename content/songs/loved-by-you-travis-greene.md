Who am I
That I remain on your mind
I don’t know but I’m grateful God
What have I done
To deserve Your only Son
I don’t know but You’re Faithful
I thank You for not
Leaving me where
You found me God
I am loved by You
I am loved by You
Just as I am
Feels good to be loved by You
Who am I
That I remain on Your mind
I don’t know but I’m grateful God
What have I done
To deserve Your only Son
I don’t know but You’re Faithful
I thank You for not
Leaving me where
You found me God
I give You reasons to go but You
Give me Your heart still
