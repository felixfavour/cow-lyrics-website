I have Jesus in my life
Living for His glory
I'm on fire every day
And nothing can stop me
It doesn't matter what I face
I am getting bigger everyday, everyday
I have Jesus in my life
Living for His glory
I'm on fire every day
And nothing can stop me
It doesn't matter what I face
I am getting bigger every day
Every day I have Jesus...
Fire everyday
(And nothing can stop me)
(It doesn't matter what I face)
(I am getting bigger every day) Getting bigger
(Everyday)
