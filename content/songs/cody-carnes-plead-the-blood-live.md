Here and now I draw a boundary
Against every weapon that's formed
The thief and his plans will pass over
When he sees the red on the door
I plead the blood
I plead the blood of Jesus
I plead the blood
I plead the blood of Jesus
The enemy can't take my family
'Cause this home belongs to the Lord
So I'm not afraid to remind him
That he has no claim in this war
I plead the blood
I plead the blood of Jesus
I plead the blood
I plead the blood of Jesus
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, thank You for the blood
Thank You for the blood)
'Cause my future is glory to glory
And my freedom's been purchased in full
For all of the weight of His suffering
The Lamb will receive His reward
I plead the blood
I plead the blood of Jesus
It's more than enough
I plead the blood of Jesus
My Shield and my Shelter
It's my defense
I claim it over and over again
I plead the blood
I plead the blood of Jesus
It's more than enough
I plead the blood of Jesus
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
Nothing good that I have done
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
Nothing good that I have done
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
For my future, this I plead
Nothing but the blood
I plead the blood
I plead the blood of Jesus
It's more than enough
I plead the blood of Jesus
My shield and my shelter
It's my defense
I claim it over and over again
My shield and my shelter
It's my defense
I claim it over and over again
My shield and my shelter
It's my defense
I claim it over and over again
I plead the blood
I plead the blood of Jesus
It's more than enough
I plead the blood of Jesus
