Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I see so much pain
From the choices that we have made
So much we would change
Can't help but wonder if its too late
There's a truth that just might save us
Love is a language,
stronger than hate
Love is forgiveness,
it doesn't run away
Love needs no weapon
It is its own defense
In the end
Love will always win,
yeah, yeah yeah yeah
I see so much war
Do we know what we are fighting for?
And it tore us apart,
yeah
But the battle's within our hearts
There's a truth that just might save us
Love is a language,
stronger than hate
Love is forgiveness,
it doesn't run away
Love needs no weapon
It is its own defense
In the end
Love will always win,
yeah
It always win,
yeah
Hey
And if tongues of angels,
with that love
We got nothing,
oh
And if faith move mountains,
with that love
We got nothing,
oh yeah yeah yeah
If tongues of angels,
with that love
We got nothing,
oh oh oh, yeah
And if faith move mountains,
with that love
We got nothing,
oh oh oh
Love is a language,
stronger than hate
Love is forgiveness,
it doesn't run away, no
Love needs no weapon
It is its own defense
In the end
Love will always win
Oh,
in the end
Love will always win,
ye
Love will always win,
oh oh
