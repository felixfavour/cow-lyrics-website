How do I, explain how God became a man
that man might be the son to God
and how do I describe how glory swallowed shame
and instead of shame you gave a crown
and I look at me I see you
and it's a wonder to my soul
your love for me I can't explain
I look at me I see you
this is what your grace has done
your love for me I can't describe
your beautiful is so beautiful
your beautiful is so beautiful
you're lovely and true
lord it makes my heart to skip
your beauty is most beautiful
your beauty makes beautiful
oh oh oh oh
how do I explain
how grace became a man
that man by grace now dignified
and how do I describe, how I oh I
became a friend of God
You look at me you see you
this is what your grace has done
your love for me I can't describe
oh oh oh
your beautiful is so beautiful
your beautiful is so beautiful
your lovely and cool
it makes my heart to skip
your beauty makes beautiful
