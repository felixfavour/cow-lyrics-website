You got times and season in your hands, you called for light out of darkness, you don't need a man to be the God you are, but you have chosen to call us your own. 

You are God from beginning to the end there's no place for argument you are God all by yourself 
       
All sufficient Almighty God. 
Sovereign one Yaweh of Israel Elsadai Adonai we worship You

You are not a man o 
You are not a man o 
You are the God who opens door no man can shut
