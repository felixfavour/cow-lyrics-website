One day you will make every thing you  Jesus ,one day you will bind everyone ,the former things shall all pass away noo more tears ,
one day you will make sense of it all Jesus , one day every question resolved  every earth  shall also be left behind noo more fear
chorus
When we all get to heaven  what a day of rejoicing that will be , when we all see Jesus  we'll  sing and shout the victory
One day we Will see face to face , Jesus  is there a  great  vision of Grace and at that moment we shall be changed  on that day and one day we will be free free indeed , Jesus  one day all the struggle will sees  and we will see your Glory reviled  On that day...
