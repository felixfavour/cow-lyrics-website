Oh Oh Oh Oh 2x

V1
I am your son, you are my father
Oh how you love to love me
Oh you are my source
there is none other
Oh how you love to love me

Chorus
My life is in your hands
you've given me another chance
just to prove my love again
my life is in your hands

i just really wanna tell ya I love you
i just really wanna tell ya I need you

Everybody clap your hands
Oh Oh Oh Oh

V2
When I'm in need you're my provider
Oh how you love to love me
Oh when i am sick you are my healer
Oh how you love to love me

Back to Chorus

Bridge
You are my joy
You are my peace
You are my strength
You're my everything

Outro
You're my everything (repeat to end)
