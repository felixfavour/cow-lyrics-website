[Chorus]
Give and it will come back to you
Good measure pressed down
Shaken together and running over
Give and it will come back to you
When you give, give to the Lord
Give in love, give in faith
Give the joy and the smile on your face
Give as the Lord has given to you
How you give is a reflection of your gratitude
(Chorus)
From your heart, give your best
Give unto God and you will be blessed
Don't be stingy and don't be tight
Learn from the widow in the Bible
Who gave her last dime
Give and it will come back to you
Good measure pressed down
Shaken together and running over
Give and it will come back to you
When you give, give to the Lord
