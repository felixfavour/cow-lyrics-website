My soul thirsts for things I can't explain
In my bones a beckoning to pray
If my heart is a battleground
My defences run both ways
The flesh is a beggar and thief
But there is a Spirit-man awakening me
When real life and peace won't make amends
When all these starts
Start feeling like these ends
Like the world is unravelling
And I'm bound to come undone
There is a Shepherd a Priest
There is a Comforter who comforts me
[Refrain 1]
And my soul finds rest
Where it makes no sense
There the blood sets me free
[Refrain 2]
All my old regrets
All my brokenness
All my failures redeemed
