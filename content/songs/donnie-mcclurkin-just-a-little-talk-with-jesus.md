I once was lost in sin, Jesus took me in And then a light from heaven filled my soul He filled my heart with love, wrote my name above Just a talk with Jesus makes it all right.

Have a little talk with Jesus Tell God about your troubles He'll hear the faintest cry And answer bye and bye Feel the prayer wheel turning Know that the fire's burning Just a talk with Jesus makes it all right
