Caught again, Your faithless friend
Don't You ever tire of hearing what a fool I've been?
Guess I should pray, but what can I say?
Oh, it hurts to know the hundred times I've caused You pain
Though "Forgive me" sounds so empty when I never change
Yet You stay and say, "I love you still"Forgiving me time and time again
It's Your stubborn love that never lets go of me
I don't understand how You can stay
Perfect love embracing the worst in me
How I long for Your stubborn love
Funny me, just couldn't see
Even long before I knew You, You were loving me
Sometimes I cry, You must cry, too
When You see the broken promises I've made to You
I keep saying that I'll trust You though I seldom do
Yet You stay and say You love me still
Knowing someday I'll be like You
And Your stubborn love, it never lets go of me
I don't understand how You can stay
Perfect love embracing the worst in me
How I long for Your stubborn love
