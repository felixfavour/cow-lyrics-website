V1
Great   is   your   Faithfulness
Oh   God   my   Father
There   is   no   shadow   of   turning   with   you
You   never   change,   your   love   remains
In   every   battle   you   carry   me   through
Pre Chorus
For   you've   already   won   it   for   me
Chorus
You   are   my   deliverer,   you   are   my   deliverer
I   call   on   your   name
You   reach   out   and   save   me
You   are   my   deliverer,   you   are   my   deliverer
I   trust   in   your   heart
Youâ€™re   a   faithful,   faithful   God
V2
Great   is   your   mighty   hand
Oh   God   my   Savior
Morning   by   morning
Your   mercies   are   new
All   that   I   need
You've   given   me
And   in   my   weakness
Your   love   will   breakthrough
