There's an Angel standing here
I can see Him just by light
There's an Angel standing here
I know I know,this world will know
There's an Angel standing here
I can see Him just by light
There's an Angel standing here
I know I know,this world will know
There's an Angel standing here
I can see Him just by light
There's an Angel standing here
I know I know,this world will know
There's an Angel lifting men
I can see Him just by light
There's an Angel lifting men
I know I know,this world will know
There's an Angel standing here
I can see Him just by light
There's an Angel standing here
I know I know,this world will know
There's an Angel lifting men
I can see Him just by light
There's an Angel lifting men
I know I know,this world will know
There's an Angel dancing here
I can see Him just by light
There's an Angel dancing now
I know I know,this world will know
