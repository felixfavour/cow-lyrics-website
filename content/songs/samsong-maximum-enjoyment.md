Minimum efforts, maximum enjoyment
nai be my portion in the name of Jesus x4
verse 1
Celebrate Grace
so that your life nor go see disgrace
you be minster of labour
na me be minster of flavor
favour end fair
labour man go dey work
favour man go dey chop
labour man go dey hustle
favour man go dey bubble
your ten years of labour
equals to my one day of favour
labour man dey partner with man
favour man dey partner with God
if you wan join me, come close
let me tell you what to do
chorus
move on to the righteous side (the righteous side is the favoured side) x3
you get the point now
Minimum efforts, maximum enjoyment
nai be my portion in the name of Jesus x4
all a faovored man can say
eh, eh eh eh eh eh eehh x2
verse 2
I started live in, I face me I face you
couldn't even afford a plate of food
I dey work all day, collect peanut
favour came
suddenly my life picked up
now I do dinner with the president
I'm the owner of a billionaire dollar residence
hanging with the big boys (big boys)
all because I'm the son of a big God
labour man na partner with man
favour man na partner with God
if you wan join me, come close
let me tell you what to do
chorus
move on to the righteous side (the righteous side is the favoured side) x4
you get the point now
Minimum efforts, maximum enjoyment
nai be my portion in the name of Jesus x5
all a faovored man can say
eh, eh eh eh eh eh eehh x4
Minimum efforts, maximum enjoyment
nai be my portion in the name of Jesus x2
you get the point now
