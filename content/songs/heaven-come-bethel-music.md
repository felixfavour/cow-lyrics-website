You are calling me again
I hear Your voice upon the wind
In the quiet, in the still
Heaven
Glory written in the sky
In the turning of the seas
Echoes of Your majesty
Heaven
[Pre-Chorus]
All that You have done
The promise that there's more to come
And all I am cries out for more of You
More of You
Your presence is heaven
Oh, to be with You
Just to be with You
Your glory all around me
Oh, to be with You
I love to be with You, oh
