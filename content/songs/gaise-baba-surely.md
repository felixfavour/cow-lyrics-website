Ilepo Alhajil'egbeda
Back then omo oko to'n wo agbada
We started from the bottom now we run things now
(Now we run things now)
Now it's been a decade, still putting work everyday
And the journey is still long now
(Still long now)
Aseyin wa aseyin bo, through it all there's been plenty ups and downs
Yet, Oluwa'n bamise
Every moment and every second, in everything I do
Baba God dey with me all the way (all the way)
So I know Surely, Surely
Won'a gbo'mi, gbo'mi n'itosi
(Won'a gbo'mi l'eko, Ibadan, Ekiti)
I know Surely, Surely
Won'a gbo'mi, gbo'mi ni gbangba
(Yankee, Ghana, Russia, China, London)
Mo ni Surely, Surely
Won'a gbo'mi, gbo'mi n'itosi
(Kaduna, Kano, Abuja, Jigawa, Kogi)
Surely, Surely
Won'a gbo'mi, gbo'mi ni gbangba
(Jamaica, Cuba, Malaysia, Singapore de Australia)
Papa gba adura, gba adura
My mama gba adura, gba adura fun mi
So I was armed to the teeth
So I dropped beat after beat
Pushing hard to make a hit
Song after song, taking too long
Asking questions make I no go wrong
Then, Baba God say Omo be strong oh
But through it all, with so many ups and downs
Yet, Oluwa'n bamise
Every moment and every second, in everything I do
Baba God dey with me all the way
(All the way)
So I know Surely, Surely
Won'a gbo'mi, gbo'mi n'itosi
(All over my neighborhood, all over my country)
I know Surely, Surely
Won'a gbo'mi, gbo'mi ni gbangba
(To the uttermost parts of the earth o)
Mo ni Surely, Surely
Won'a gbo'mi, gbo'mi n'itosi
(All around Africa)
Surely, Surely
Won'a gbo'mi, gbo'mi ni gbangba
Mo ni Surely, Surely
Won'a gbo'mi, gbo'mi n'itosi
Surely, Surely
Won'a gbo'mi, gbo'mi ni gbangba
