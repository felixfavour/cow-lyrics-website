I've carried a burden for too long on my own
I wasn't created to bear it alone
I hear Your invitation to let it all go
I see it now, laying it down, I know that I need You
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again
You saw my condition, had a plan from the start
Your Son for redemption, the price for my heart
And I don't have a context for that kind of love
I don't understand, I can't comprehend, all I know is I need You
I run to the Father, I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding, no reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon, my soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Fathеr again and again and again and again
[Bridge]
My heart has been in Your sights long before my first brеath
Running into Your arms is running to life from death
And I feel this rush deep in my chest, your mercy is calling out
Just as I am You pull me in and I know I need You now
