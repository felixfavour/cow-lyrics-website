Larry-Boy! Larry-Boy!
Lean and mean green machine!
Larry-Boy! Larry-Boy!
Out of sight, veg-o-mite!
Larry-Boy!
Who do they call when Bumblyburg's in trouble?
Who's got the suit with super-suction ears?
There's no need to panic, 'cause this guy's manic
And you know that he'll save the day!
You need a hand, he's right there on the double
Hey, hey, he's on the way
Purple and yellow! He's one super fellow!
Larry-Boy! Larry-Boy!
Lean and mean green machine!
Larry-Boy! Larry-Boy!
Out of sight, veg-o-mite!
Larry-Boy!
Where do you turn when this world needs a hero?
A man with style and plungers on his head?
It's easy to prove he's just one of the grooviest
Cats that you'll ever know
It's plain to see in fashion he's no zero
At the wheel of the Larry-mobile
Purple and yellow! He's one super fellow!
