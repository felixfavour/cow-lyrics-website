[Chorus]
(Yes, God)
I love this place
Here in one place
I love this place
Thank You for accepting me
Thank You for receiving me
(Anybody just grateful?)
I know I don't deserve it, but I love this place
Here in one place
I love this place
Oh, thank You for accepting us
Thank You for receiving us
Here in one place
I love this place, yeah
Thank You for accepting me
(You tell Him) Thank You for receiving me
You didn't have to, but I thank You for accepting me
(Every voice tell Him) Thank You for accepting me
Thank You for receiving me
[Outro]
Thank You for receiving us
Thank You for accepting us
Thank You for receiving us
Thank You for accepting us
Nothing so great that we've done
But I thank You for receiving us
(Somebody oughta tell Him)
Thank You for receiving me
I've been disobedient sometime
But I thank You for accepting us
Thank You for receiving me
