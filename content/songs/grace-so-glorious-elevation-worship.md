Beneath the cross of Jesus Christ
No shadow remains for shame to hide
Redemption shone for all to see
Perfection bore our penalty
With a grace so glorious...
Immortal day the veil was torn
When mercy donned a crown of thorns
As law gave way to liberty
And freedom for humanity
With a grace so glorious
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, the glory of the Savior's love
Surrounding our surrender
To know forever we are welcomed home
Crowned in glory to glory
Worthy is the Lord of all
The glory forever
Holy is the Lord
Crowned in glory to glory
Worthy is the Lord of all
The glory forever
Holy is the Lord
