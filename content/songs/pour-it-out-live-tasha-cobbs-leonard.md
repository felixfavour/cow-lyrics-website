Heaven smiles upon your broken worship
Pour it out, pour it out
Jesus knows just how much it cost you
Pour it out, pour it out
'Cause He is near, drawing near
He is near to the broken-hearted
He is here, always here
Pour it out, pour it out
If it's fear that's keeping you from trusting
Pour it out, pour it out (Woo!)
And if it's pride that's keeping you from breaking
Just pour it out, pour it out
'Cause He is near, drawing near
He is near to the broken-hearted
He is here, always here
Pour it out, pour it out
[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Ohh)
Oh-oh-oh (Ohh), oh-oh-oh (Ohh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh), oh-oh
(Ohh) Oh-oh-oh (Yeah) oh-oh-oh
(God, we pour out, we pour out)
Oh-oh-oh (Ohh), oh-oh
(It's the cry of our hеarts)
Oh-oh-oh (We say ohh) oh-oh-oh (Ohh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Ohh) oh-oh (Hey!)
