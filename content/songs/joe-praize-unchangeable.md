Mighty God
Hallow be thy name
Faithful God
You are worthy to receive
All the praise
For you alone
You're the air that I breath
The song that I sing
You are the lover of my soul
With you
There's no impossiblity
With you
I can move the mountain
Whatever you say
Will surely come to pass
At the mention of your name
Every kneel must bow
Oh
