[Intro: PJ Morton]
I just couldn't let it go
Without letting the ladies encourage you a little bit, too
You don't have to worry
No matter how dark it is, I promise it's gonna get better
Lisa Knowles Smith, tell 'em
Don't you worry and don't you fret
Better, better
Cause I know God ain't never failed me yet
Better, better
(He never failed failed me yet)
He knows the plans He has for you
Better, better
And I believe He'll do everything He said He would do
Better, better
(Everything He said)
And then He told me to tell you everything gon' be alright, yeah
Better, better
And He's gonna wipe every tear from your eye
Better, better
Oh, so don't you give up and don't you give in
Better, better
Hang on in there my friend
(That's right, Le'Andria Johnson, come on)
