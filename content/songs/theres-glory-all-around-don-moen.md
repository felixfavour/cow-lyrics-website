How lovely is Your dwelling place
How beautiful Your throne
Amazing love shines from Your face
And there's Glory all around
There's Glory all around
Your temple's filled with majesty
In splendor You're adored
Your presence makes the blind to see
For there's Glory all around
There's Glory all around
Son of God
Find in us Your home
May our hearts become Your throne
Build in us a House of living stones
Where there's Glory all around
There's Glory all around
How lovely is Your dwelling place
How beautiful Your throne
Amazing love shines from Your face
And there's Glory all around
There's Glory all around
