there is no fear cos I believe
there is no doubt cos I have seen

found in your name
I have a strength
found in your grace
your faithfulness my fortress
over and over

make way through the water
walk me through the fire
do what you are famous for
what you are famous for
shut the mouth of lions
bring dry bones to live and
do what you are famous for
what you are famous for
Jacklyn: I believe in you
Tauren: God I believe in you
Release your love

unleash your power
for all to see
spirit come and fall on us
over and over oh Lord
