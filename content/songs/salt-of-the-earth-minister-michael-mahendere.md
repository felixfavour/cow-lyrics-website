I′m the salt of the earth
I'm the salt of the earth
I carry the flavour of God
I season the earth

I′m the city, city, I'm the city, city
I′m the city built on the high hill
Like yeast I influence the world
I am rich, I am prosperous, I am blessed

I'm a the light of the world
I′m a the light of the world
I shine the light of God upon the earth

I live to dominate
Surely there is no enchantment against me
No divination against me I am covered

Yeeh I'm highly favoured
I′m highly favoured
I'm highly favoured
I′m highly favoured
In Jesus name
