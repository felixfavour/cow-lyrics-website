The wind and waves surround me
And I’m tossed, feel like I’m drowning
I am tired, I am weak, I need You here with me
‘Cause I can feel the rising tide
But I don’t have the strength to fight
I feel clouded and confused, I need You here with me
[Pre-Chorus 1]
In the chaos of the storm
I have drifted far, far away
Oh, but I call out Your name
And You are just a breath, a breath away
Then through the shadows Your light appears
I’ve known You’re with me, but now it is clear
I can feel You, Jesus all around
Like sun on my skin, warm to the touch
Here You surround me, and I am held by love
I can feel You, Jesus all around
Now hope is rushing through my veins
'Cause everything You’ve rearranged
I am peaceful, I am brave when You’re here with me
All my questions find their answers here
Oh, when You come, You change the atmosphere
I am focused, I am clear when You’re here with me
