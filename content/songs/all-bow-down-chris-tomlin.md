You're arriving with the sound of thunder and rain
You're arriving in the calm of the wind and the waves
You're arriving in the glow of a burning flame
A burning flame
Praise awaits you at the dawn when the world come alive
Praise awaits you in the darkness and shines in the light
Praise awaits you with a song of love and desire, love and desire
Here comes the king
All bow down
Lift up your voices
Unto the lamb
He is the king
All bow down
All bow down
You are coming again like a thief in the night
You are coming again with a shout from the sky
You are coming again to take away your bride
To take away your bride
Yeah, you are the king
Yeah, you are the king
Yeah, you are the king
