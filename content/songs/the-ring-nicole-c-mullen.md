Got a call from my old friend
Said she fell in love again
But there's one thing she should know
Real true love will only grow
Grow like flowers from the rain
Mystery I can't explain
But there's one thing I can do
Is lay out the facts for you
True love is faithful
Like spring in April
It is as dependable as time
And it is able to hold on and survive
When other loves might say goodbye
If you wanna step to me
You better know one thing
This love I've got you'll never get without a wedding ring
If you wanna step to me
You better know one thing
This love I've got you'll never get without a wedding ring
Friend called back said "Can it be
I love him, him love me!
But he said he'll never wed; rather play the field instead
Fields of taller, grassy green
Kind you find in magazines"
Well I said "If that be so
By all means then let him go"
