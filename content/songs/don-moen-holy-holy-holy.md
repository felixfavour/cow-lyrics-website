Holy Holy Holy, Lord God Almighty
Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee
Holy Holy Holy, merciful and mighty
God in three Persons, Blessed Trinity
Holy Holy Holy, though the darkness hide Thee
Thou the eye of sinful men, Thy glory may not see
Only Thou art Holy, there is none beside Thee
Perfect in power in love and purity
Holy Holy Holy, Lord God Almighty
All Thy works shall praise Thy Name
In earth and sky and sea
Holy Holy Holy, merciful and mighty
God in three Persons, Blessed Trinity
God in thee Persons, Blessed Trinity
