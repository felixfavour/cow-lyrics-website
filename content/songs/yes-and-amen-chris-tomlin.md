Father of kindness You have poured out grace
You brought me out of darkness
You have filled me with peace
Giver of mercy You're my help in time of need
Lord I can't help but sing
Faithful, You are
Faithful, forever You will be
Faithful, You are
All Your promises are yes and amen
All Your promises are yes and amen
Beautiful Saviour You have brought me near
You pulled me from the ashes
You have broken every curse
Blessed Redeemer You have set this captive free
Lord I can't help but sing
Faithful, You are
Faithful, forever You will be
Faithful, You are
All Your promises are yes and amen
All Your promises are yes and amen
Faithful, You are
Faithful, forever You will be
Faithful, You are
All Your promises are yes and amen
