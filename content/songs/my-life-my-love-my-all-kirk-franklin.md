My 
hands were made
To worship you
My 
heart,
 my King
It beats for you
Oh Lamb
So true
I surrender to you
My life
(I give)
My love
(I give)
My all
(All)
Your touch
Your kiss
Your grace
To me
Is deeper
Than my soul can see
My purpose it changed
When I called out your name
My life
(I give)
My love
(I give)
My all
(All)
