Come all you weary, come all you thirsty
Come to the well that never runs dry
Drink of the Water, come and thirst no more
Well, come all you sinners, come find His mercy
Come to the table, He will satisfy
Taste of His goodness, find what you're looking for
For God so loved the world that He gave us
His one and only Son to save us
Whoever believes in Him will live forever
Bring all your failures, bring your addictions
Come lay them down at the foot of the cross
Jesus is waiting there with open arms
Can you see His open arms? Here we go
For God so loved the world that He gave us
His one and only Son to save us
Whoever believes in Him will live forever
The power of hell forever defeated
Now it is well, I'm walking in freedom
For God so loved, God so loved the world
Praise God, praise God
From whom all blessings flow
Praise Him, praise Him
For the wonders of His love
Praise God, praise God
From whom all blessings flow
Praise Him, praise Him
For the wonders of His love
His amazing love
For God so loved the world that He gave us
His one and only Son to save
For God so loved the world that He gave us
His one and only Son to save us
Whoever believes in Him will live forever
Oh, the power of hell forever defeated
Now it is well, I'm walking in freedom
For God so loved, God so loved the world
Bring all your failures, bring your addictions
Come lay them down at the foot of the cross
Jesus is waiting, God so loved the world
