I heard that there are seasons
To laugh and to cry
I struggle with the season
When You lived and You died
It's hard to play this game
Because the rules, they don't seem fair
If You care, God if You're still there
Bombs falling in Syria
A child dying of AIDS
Fighting 'round the world
A daddy lost his girl
Still we kneeled and prayed
But Heaven can feel silent
And the floor beneath gets cold
When your soul refuses to let go
[Pre-Chorus]
But wait, tell me am I too late?
What happens when the healing never comes?
Do we stand and curse the heavens
Or lift our hands and feel the sun
The mystery's not clear
Just once, Your voice I'd love to hear
What happens when the healing never comes?
