[Chorus]
It's not over
If you've got air to breathe
It's not over
Don't believe everything you see
You're a fighter
Weapons from somewhere higher
They light up when you're closer
If God says it's not over
Get up 'cause it's not over
(Yeah get up, get up, get up)
Get up 'cause it's not over
(Yeah get up, get up, get up)
It's not over
Please tell that to the weight upon my shoulder
If joy comes in the morning how much longer
Do I knock on Heaven's door 'cause it won't open
Can't breathe, too broken to believe
See I know that you've been here before but
But if you look closer
The thing that didn't kill you made you stronger
That's why it's not over
