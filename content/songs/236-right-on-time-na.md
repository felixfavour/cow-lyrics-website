They said for Jesus, your friend's about to die
But tarried He, still on behind
So they laid Lazarus in a tomb
And said their last goodbye
Then coming down the road was Jesus right on time

Just hold on my child because He's not too far away And He knows your need before you pray So when your feet are weary From the mountain you have climbed Look ahead, here comes Jesus right on time 

I've struggled through life's deserts They were so hot and dry 'Til it seemed all hope was gone and I would die And I've wondered where was He Is He still a friend of mine Then coming down the road was Jesus right on time

Just hold on my child because He's not too far away And He knows your need before you pray So when your feet are weary From the mountain you have climbed Look ahead, here comes Jesus right on time 

So when your feet are weary From the mountain you have climbed Look ahead, here comes Jesus right on time
