[Intro]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Through valleys of shadow, we walk unafraid
There in the battle, we're lifting Your name
Standing together, forever, we're marching on
Though darkness surrounds, there's hope in our eyes
For You are our victory, our joy and our prize
Standing together, forever, we're marching on
We are believers
All our hope in the Risen One
And we are soldiers
We're fighting with faith and love
And we are pilgrims
On a journey to reach our home
Standing together
We are the Children of God
Nothing can stop us, for You're on our side
Even in dying, our souls are alive
Standing together, forever, we're marching on, yeah
