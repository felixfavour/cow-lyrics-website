When I lift, I lift my hands
(I'm telling you thank you)
I'm telling the Lord Thank you
Everytime I shed a tear of joy
(I'm saying I love you)
Saying I love you, hmm
Because I realize, I realize
(You didn't have to do what you did, but you did it anyhow)
Oh, you been, you been, you been
(So good)
You been so good
And I thank you Lord
(Oh yeah) oh yeah
You've been so good
When I lift my hand
(I'm telling you thank you)
I'm telling you Thank you
When I shed tears of joy
(I'm saying I love you)
I'm saying I love you Jesus
Because I, I realize
(You didn't have to do what you did but you did it anyhow)
Oh, and I'd like to sing and tell the world that you have been
(So good)
Ooh you been, you been
(Oh yeah)
You been
(So good)
So good
