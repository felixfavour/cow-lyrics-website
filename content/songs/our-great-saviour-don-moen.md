Jesus what a Friend for sinners
Jesus Lover of my soul
Friends may fail me foes assail me
He my Savior makes me whole
Hallelujah what a Savior
Hallelujah what a Friend
Saving helping keeping loving
He is with me to the end
Jesus what a Strength in weakness
Let me hide myself in Him
Tempted tried and sometimes failing
He my Strength my vict'ry wins
Hallelujah what a Savior
Hallelujah what a Friend
Saving helping keeping loving
He is with me to the end
Jesus I do now receive Him
More than all in Him I find
He hath granted me forgiveness
I am His and He is mine
Hallelujah what a Savior
Hallelujah what a Friend
Saving helping keeping loving
He is with me to the end
