It's all in Your name Lord
Whatever I claim Lord
Jesus whatsoever
I want is in Your name
It's all in Your name Lord
Whatever I claim Lord
Jesus whatsoever
I want is in Your name
You will supply Lord
Whatsoever
I want is in Your name

Whatever I want
It's all in Your name
Whatever I need
It's in Your Holy name
Whenever I call upon Your name
All that I need You will surely bring
It's all in Your name Lord
It's all in Your name Lord
All in Your name



If I need peace
Peace, it's in Your name Lord
If I need joy
Joy, it's in Your name Lord
Whatsoever I want is in Your name
[repeat]
