Intro:
Father, Your word says that our battle is not against flesh and blood, but against powers and principalities and rulers of this dark age, but you have designed and ordained armor and weapons for us to come against the wickedness in high places. Right now we put on the helmet of salvation, we lift up the shield of faith, and we clothe ourselves with the breastplate of righteousness, and we pick up the sword of truth. And in the mighty name of Jesus our Saviour, we declare war in the heavenlies!
Making war in the heavenlies tearing down principalities
Standing firm in Jesus’ victory
Making war in the heavenlies casting down every high thing
That exalts itself against the knowledge of Christ
We do not bow our knee to the prince of the air
We know the truth has set us free
And under our feet he will shortly be crushed
And having done all we’ll stand in victory
Our hearts are set apart for the courts of the Lord
And we will not be bought or sold
By His spirit in us we will overcome
Pulling down every stronghold
