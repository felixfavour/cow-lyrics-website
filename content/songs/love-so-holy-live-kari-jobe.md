God of all existence
Sovereign with no end
An architect of wonder
From dust You made a man
Speaking light from nothing
The universe aglow
Shining just to show me
You love me
You love me
You love me
This I know, this I know
You love me
You love me
You love me
This I know, this I know
Eyes as wild as fire
Hair as white as wool
A voice with strength like thunder
You reign in humble rule
You left Your crown for suffering
For death upon a cross
You gave Your life to tell mะต
