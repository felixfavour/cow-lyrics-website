[Intro: Kristian Stanfill]
It's still You, Lord
Oh, it's still You, Lord
Right here now
It's time for the sleeper to wake
It's time for the old winds to change
Oh, I hear the Spirit say, "It's time"It's time for the dead man to rise
It's time for the great light to shine
Oh, I hear the Spirit say, "It's time"Oh, it's time
[Chorus: Kari Jobe & Cody Carnes]
Fling wide Heavenly gates
Let the King of glory in
Let the King of glory in
Come ride in on Your people's praise
Let the King of glory in (Oh)
Let the King of glory in
Oh, it's time, it's time, it's time
It's time for the sleeper to wake
It's time for the old winds to change
Oh, I hear the Spirit say, "It's time"It's time for the dead man (Come on) to rise
It's time for the great light to shine
Oh, I hear the Spirit say, "It's time"Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah
