Ikemo ikemo ezemo ezemo, you are the God of power ikemo ikemo2âï¸ you do unimaginable things you are indiscribable God you are the God of power ikemo ikemo you declare the end from the beginning
And from the ancient times the things that are not yet done
You are the God of power ikemo ikemo
You raised the dead by your power
You heal by your power
You deliver by your power ikemo ikemo
You formed a baby without a womb
You divided the Red Sea by the breath of your nostril
You are the God of power ikemo ikemo
You never never know defeat
How can I describe you Jehovah divinity becomes humanity
Ibu amama macha amacha
You are the God of power ikemo ikemo
