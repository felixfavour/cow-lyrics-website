And who can melt the hardest heart
And speak life into my soul?
And who can spin the world around
And hold me ever close?
And who can search the depths of me
Love me to the core?
And who controls the world I see
And walks me through it all?
No one but You
No one but You
And who has made the righteous bright?
Who has paved my way with grace?
Loved me through my darkest hours
A thousand different ways?
No one but You
No one but You
[Post-Chorus]
And I'll sing of Your love, I can't get enough
I just want You
The Lord of my soul, King of my heart
Jesus, it's You, oh, oh, oh-oh
