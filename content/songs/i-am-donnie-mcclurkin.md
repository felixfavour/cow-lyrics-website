Come now and see this mystery
Remove your shoes, bow down
Where you stand right now is holy ground
The fire burns, sit at my feet and learn
As I reveal my plan, and I tell you who I am
I Am, I Am
I'm the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
I Am, I Am
And I've chosen you to set my people free
Go now and set them free
Some will not hear, others will fear
Because the enemy has said
Before I let them go, I'd rather see them dead
But in that hour, I will reveal my power through you
So that all may see, and when they ask you
Tell them what you know of me
I Am, I Am
I'm the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
I Am, I Am
And I've chosen you to set my people free
Go now and set them free
I give you heaven's edge
And I give you privilege
Where others know my works
You will know my plan
