So many reasons
Too many to count
To say that I love You
To worship You now
Your love is perfect
Your heart is kind
I'm Yours forever
Forever You're mine
Jesus, the anthem of my heart
Jesus, the anchor of my soul
I'm overwhelmed by all You are
Oh how I love You
You call me beloved
You call me friend
Your grace says I am worthy
You welcome me in
Now all that I long for
And all that I need
Is to be in Your presence
Forever I fall at Your feet
