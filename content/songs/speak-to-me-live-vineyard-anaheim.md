How I love to hear the voice that speaks my name
You give me faith to stand and sing, with hope again
And when I hear Your words of life
A hunger stirs like a fire inside
Speak to me, call me from the darkness
Just one word can break my heart with what breaks Yours
Jesus, I hear You singing over me
You call my name, how sweet the sound, the voice of God
When I hear my Savior's voice, I know it's true
That You can take a broken life and make it new
So in Your arms I'll always stay
And hang on every word You say
Speak to me, call me from the darkness
Just one word can break my heart with what breaks Yours
Jesus, I hear You singing over me
You call my name, how sweet the sound, the voice of God
[Bridge]
(Oh, when God speaks)
When God speaks, nations will tremble
When God speaks, everything changes
When God speaks, we will surrender
Oh God speak, whisper Your love song
Oh God speak, set me on fire
Oh God speak, and I will surrender
