I'm caught up in Your presence
I just want to sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave

Oh, I'm not here for blessings
Jesus, You don't owe me anything
And more than anything that You can do
I just want You

I'm sorry when I've just gone 
through the motions
I'm sorry when I just sang another song
Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to you

I'm sorry when I've come with my agenda
I'm sorry when I forgot that Your enough
Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to You

I just want You
Nothing else
Nothing else
Nothing else will do
(repeat)

I'm caught up in Your presence
I just want to sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave

Oh, I'm not here for blessings
Jesus, You don't owe me anything
And more than anything that You can do
I just want You
