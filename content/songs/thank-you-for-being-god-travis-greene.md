You're too big for error
You're too wise for mistakes
You are a mighty God
Perfect in all your ways
You were here before my first breath,
And you'll be here when nothing else is left
You are a mighty God
Forever and always
You're too big for error.
You're too wise for mistakes.
You are a mighty God
Perfect in all your ways.
You were here before my first breath,
And you'll be here when nothing else is left.
You are a mighty God
Forever and always
Oh Oh Oh
You loved me in spite of my flaws
You hold me close in the midst of it all
A present help when I am in need
I'm grateful that You won't give up on me.
You love me when no one else would
You kept me when no one else could
Thank you for being God (x4)
