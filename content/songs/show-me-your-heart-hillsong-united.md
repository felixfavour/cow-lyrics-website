Wide awake in the dead of night
While the world comes apart
You keep watch when my vision is blurry
And my thoughts run afar
You step in when the wolves come prowling
And the thieves come to steal
'Cause You don't sleep when my world spins in darkness
And I can't tell what's real
Show me Your heart 'cause I need a Father
Show me Your love 'cause I need something that won't break
Show me Your scars 'cause I need a Saviour
Show me Your heart
'Cause I just need a place I can run
And fall into the arms of my Father
I just need to know there's someone
So beautiful to me
You don't hide from my heavy mess
When I hide the worst parts
You don't run from the thick of the fight
No, You never lose heart
You don't quit when I throw the towel in
Or lose patience when I fall
'Cause You just give and You never give up
Till I'm every bit Yours
