[Intro]
Keep on talkin' to me, keep on talkin' to me
Keep on talkin' to me, keep on talkin' to me
Keep on talkin' to me, keep on talkin' to me
Keep on talkin' to me
Speak to my heart, Holy Spirit
Give me the words that will bring new life
Words on the wings of a morning, the dark night will fade away
If You speak to my heart now
Speak to my heart, Holy Spirit
Message of love, love to encourage me
Lifting my heart from despair, how You love (love me) and care for me
Speak to my heart now, oh Lord
Speak to my heart, Holy Spirit
Give me the words that will bring new life
Words on the wings of a morning, my dark nights will fade away
Speak to my heart
Speak to my heart, Holy Spirit
Message of love to encourage me
Lifting my heart from despair, how You love me and care for me
Speak to my heart
