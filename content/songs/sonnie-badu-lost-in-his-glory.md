wanna be lost in your glory
I wanna kneel down at your feet
I wanna feel your holy presence
As I worship you
I wanna be captured by your holiness
I wanna be cleansed by your blood
I wanna be lost in your glory
Sure kind of glory
I wanna be lost in your glory
I wanna kneel down at your feet
I wanna feel your holy presence
As I worship you
I wanna be captured by your holiness
I wanna be cleansed by your blood
I wanna be lost in your glory
Sure kind of glory
We want you to fall on us
Rain on us
Pour on us
With your glory
We need you to fall on us
Rain on us
Pour on us
With your glory
