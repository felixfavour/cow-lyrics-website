Chorus:
And yet I’m still saved
Not by my own power, not by my strength
And yet I’m still saved, saved, saved
(And I’m going on) I’m going on
(said I’m going on) I’m saved and I’m going on
I’ve been through some valleys
I have been oh so very low
I have had some rough times
Some people have really hurt me so
Jesus was a friend, He was consistent in every way
When Satan tried to kill me
Yes, He came and He put him back in his place
He gave me the power to change everything in my life
And even though Satan still exists
He will never have control, control of my soul
Chorus
Vamp:
Going on, going on, going on
I’m still saved yet
