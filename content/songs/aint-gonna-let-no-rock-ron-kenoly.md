We've gathered in this dwelling place
A house of living stones
We've given praise Lord
You've made Your presence known
Now we worship and sing
Hallelujah
Christ has risen from the dead
But if our praises cease
If we hold our peace
The rocks will cry out instead
I ain't gonna let
No rock outpraise me
I ain't gonna let
No rock cry in my place
I ain't gonna let
No rock outpraise me
I ain't gonna let it sing
In my place
I will make a joyful noise
I will sing a joyful song
That is pleasing to
The ear of the Lord
I will make a joyful noise
I will sing a joyful song
That is pleasing to the ear of the Lord
