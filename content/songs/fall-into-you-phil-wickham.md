Oh, who am I that Your merciful eyes should fall on me?
A sinner, a fool, who doesn't deserve You
And what am I that You'd offer Your life and die for me, what can I do?
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm nothing without You
I'm nothing without You
I'm nothing without You my love, my saving love
So I fall into You, I'm desperate and weak
Crying out from my heart, take all of me
How can it be that the heart of my God would long for me
For all that You do
[Pre-Chorus]
Jesus, I love You, I'll always love You
Jesus, I love You with all of my heart
So I fall into You, I'm desperate and weak
Crying out from my heart, take all of me
