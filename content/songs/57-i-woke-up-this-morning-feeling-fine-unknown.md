I woke up this morning feeling fine. I woke up with heaven on my mind. I woke up with joy in my soul, I knew the Lord had made me whole. I woke up this morning feeling right, I'd been on my knees in the night. I woke up this morning feeling fine and now I'm feeling mighty fine. 

Oh, yes I'm feeling mighty fine. I've got Heaven on my mind. I want to know, I want to go where the mild and honey flows. There's a light that always shines, down inside this heart of mine. I've got heave, heave on my mind and now I'm feeling mighty fine.

I've been walking with Jesus all the time. We've been walking and talking as we climb. We're traveling a road to the sky, where I know I'll live when I die. He's been telling me all about that land, and He tells me that everything is grand. He says that a home will be mine, and now I'm feeling mighty fine. 

Oh, yes I'm feeling mighty fine. I've got Heaven on my mind. I want to know, I want to go where the mild and honey flows. There's a light that always shines, down inside this heart of mine. I've got heave, heave on my mind and now I'm feeling mighty fine.
