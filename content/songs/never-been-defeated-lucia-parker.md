V1
You   love   me   like   a   lion
You   keep   me   from   falling
You   hold   me   in   the   night   and
You   show   me   Iâ€™m   safe   in   you
Pre Chorus
Your   perfect   love
Will   keep   me   close   to   you
Your   perfect   love   has   come   to   make   me
Chorus
Fearless
You   make   me   fearless
The   blood   of   Jesus,   Jesus   Christ   has
Never   been   defeated,   never   been   defeated
V2
You   know   me   at   me   weakest
You   find   me   at   my   lowest
You   lift   me   from   the   ashes
And   you   tell   me   all   things   are   new
Bridge
Like   a   lion   you   will   fight   for   me
Through   the   fire   I   will   not   fear
You   have   promised   every   victory   is   yours
You've   never   been   defeated
Never   been   defeated
