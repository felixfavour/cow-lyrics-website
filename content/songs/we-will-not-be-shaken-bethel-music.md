[Chorus]
For we trust in our God
And through His unfailing love
We will not be shaken
We will not be shaken
We will not be shaken
For we trust in our God
And through His unfailing love
We will not be shaken
We will not be shaken
We will not be shaken
Though the battle rages, we will stand in the fight
Though the armies rise up against us on all sides
We will not be shaken
We will not be shaken
We will not be shaken
[Pre-Chorus]
For in the hour of our darkest day
We will not tremble, we won't be afraid
Hope is rising like the light of dawn
Our God is for us, He has overcome
For we trust in our God
And through His unfailing love
We will not be shaken
We will not be shaken
We will not be shaken
For we trust in our God
And through His unfailing love
We will not be shaken
We will not be shaken
We will not be shaken
