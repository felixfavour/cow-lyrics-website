I remember the moment You found me
You said you love me
And oh how good it sounded
You pulled me up out of the grave
And I've seen so much since that day
[Pre-Chorus]
I've seen wonders that only You could do
I've seen miracles that only You could prove
Victory on victory
Oh You've been so good to me
I've got so much history of how good You are
You've been the guiding light in me right through the dark
Whatever giants I may face, I don't have to be afraid
'Cause I've got so much history of how good You are
I've seen mountains move right in front of my eyes
I've seen your power movе the waters so wide
Timе and time and time again
I have seen your faithfulness
I've got so much history of how good You are
You've been the guiding light in me right through the dark
Whatever giants I may face, I don't have to be afraid
'Cause I've got so much history of how good You are
