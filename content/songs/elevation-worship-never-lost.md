Miracles when you move
Such an easy thing for you to do
Your hand is moving right now
You are still showing up
at the tomb of every Lazarus
Your voice is calling me out
Right now, I know you're able
??????????????????????????
You can do all things
You can do all things but fail
'cause you've never lost a battle
No, you've never lost a battle
And I know, I know you never will
Everything's possible by the power of the Holy Ghost
A new wind is flowing right now
Breaking my heart of stone
Taking over like a ????????
And my worlds are all crashing down
Right now I know you're able
????????????????
You can do all things
You can do all things  but fail cause you've never lost a battle
No, you've never lost a battle
And I know I know you never will
You can do all things
You can do all things{You can do all things but fail} cause you've never lost a battle
No, you've never lost a battle
And I know I know, you never will
Never lost a battle
You've never lost a battle
You've never lost a battle
You never will{You never will}
You've never lost a battle
You've never lost a battle
You've never lost a battle
Never! Never!
You can do alllllll{You can do all things}
You can do all things
You can do all things but fail cause you've never lost a battle
No you've never lost a battle
I know I know youu never will
{Cause nothing's impossible for You
You can do all things but fail cause you've never lost a battle
No you've never lost a battle
I know I know you never will
Cause I know, Oh I know you never will
I know you never will
