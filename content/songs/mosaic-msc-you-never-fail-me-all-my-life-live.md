You are my day and night
You are my every breath
Here in this moment and infinite
How wonderful, how beautiful , how perms nent
You never fail me all my life
When I'm surrounded, you're by my side
How wonderful, how beautiful , how permanent
You never fail me all my life
You are my resting place
You are my solid ground
Always before me and around me
How wonderful, how beautiful,how permanent
You never fail me nTime and time again
You are there for me
When I lost my faith
You were faithful still
You don't see my past
I'm not looking back
You just promise me
To the end you're there
