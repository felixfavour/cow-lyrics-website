Hallelujah, hallelujah, Oh hallelujah

You’re my solid rock, and my salvation;
No one but you
You’re my present help, in times of trouble; 
I will praise you

Agam e buru Aleluya e buru
(I will lift up my praise)
Para Aleluya para
(I will praise Hallelujah in song)

Agam e buru Aleluya bugara Chineke 
(I’ll lift up my praise to the Lord)

Otua ka Chineke m di e
(This is how my God is)
Agidigba e, Agidigba e
(He is mighty! He is mighty!)
Otua ka Chineke m sha tom e
(This is how amazing my God is)
Agidigba e, Agidigba e
(He is mighty! He is mighty!) (Repeat)

When I remember what you’ve done for me
Agidigba e, Agidigba e
(He is mighty! He is mighty!)

When I remember what you’ve done for me, Lord
Agidigba e, Agidigba e
(He is mighty! He is mighty!)

Pamoja x4 na Yesu! 
(Together x4 with Jesus)
Teremka, teremka x4 
(Go down/ Descend)

Panda, panda x4 (Ascend)
Hallelujah, hallelujah, Oh hallelujah
