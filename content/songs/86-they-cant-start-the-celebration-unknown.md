A great event shall soon take place; I've been invited by His grace. As the angels are preparing for me to come, for they can't march around the throne, and they can't sing victory song, they can't start the celebration till I get there. 

We'll crown Hin King of Kings, and Lord of Lord's forever a million years will be as just another day.  All the sights they shall behold, as they walk on the streets of gold, but they can't the celebration till I get there. 

A banquet table will be spread, where all the hungry can be fed, as the Master calls His children to come and dine. Friends and loved ones I long to see, I know that they'll be waiting for me. They can't start the celebration till I get there. 

We'll crown Hin King of Kings, and Lord of Lord's forever a million years will be as just another day.  All the sights they shall behold, as they walk on the streets of gold, but they can't the celebration till I get there. 

They can't start the celebration til I get there.
