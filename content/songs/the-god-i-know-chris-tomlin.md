I've seen Your goodness, I've known Your mercy
Countless times before
I've felt the thunder, I've heard the whisper
The voice that calms the storm
[Pre-Chorus]
When the world is shaken, You're my firm foundation
Be still, be still my soul
The God I know, will make a way
Whatever comes, whatever I face
The God I know, is strong to save
He is the Lord, He conquered the grave
And this is the God I know-ow
And this is the God I know-ow
I remember, when the waters parted
How You led me through
And all I've needed, You have provided
Your promises are true
[Pre-Chorus]
When the world is shaken, You're my firm foundation
Be still, be still my soul
