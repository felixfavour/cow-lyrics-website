Intro
Mo ro pe ile aye mi titan sẹ (I thought my life was finished)
Mo ro pe aye o ni de ba mi (I thought life will not come to me)
Mo ro pe á»lọrun ti gbagbe mi n'ile aye yi oo (I thought God has forgotten me in this world)
Mo ro pe eṣu j'ọba (I thought the devil had won)
All Around me was darkness everywhere
I looked left and right couldn't find nobody to help
I cried and cried and I shout so loud
Oh Jesus! where are You?
No, no, no, I couldn't take it anymore
Suddenly, I can see the Light shining bright
Suddenly, It's raining again on me
Oh, oh, oh...
Dry bones walking again
I can see the sunshine
I'm a new creation
Where would I have been, if you left me all alone
I can't even know, You were with me all along
Yesterday, Today, Forever,
You're the same, You never change
Look at me, I don't even look like what I've been through
For what you've done I will give my all to You
Take it all as a Living sacrifice
Emmanuel, oh... Emmanuel, oh..
I will never ever, never ever, never ever, let you go
Suddenly, I can see the Light shining bright
Suddenly, It's raining again on me
Oh, oh, oh...
Dry bones walking again
I can see the sunshine
I'm a new creation
Suddenly, I can see the Light shining bright
Suddenly, It's raining again on me
Oh, oh, oh...
Dry bones walking again
I can see the sunshine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
Let me hear you make a joyful noise
Ooh, oh, oh, Ooh, oh, oh...
Ooh, oh, oh, Ooh, oh, oh...
Ooh, oh, oh, Ooh, oh, oh...
Ooh, oh, oh, Ooh, oh, oh...
I can feel the rain (Ooh, oh, oh..)
I can see the sunshine (Ooh, oh, oh...)
I can feel the rain (Ooh, oh, oh..)
I can see the sunshine (Ooh, oh, oh...)
I can feel the rain (Ooh, oh, oh..)
I can see the sunshine (Ooh, oh, oh...)
It's raining on me (Ooh, oh, oh...)
It's raining on you (Ooh, oh, oh...)
Let it rain eeeooo
Let it rain, yeee...
Let it rain oh...
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain
I can feel the rain
Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
Mo wa dupẹ (I am Grateful)
I can feel your Love all over me
Then Suddenly, the Land is Green
End
