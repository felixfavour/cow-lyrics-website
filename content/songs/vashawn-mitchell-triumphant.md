Triumphant
I am not defeated
Triumphant
The battle's already won
There's a greater power in me
There's a greater power in me
I will not be defeated
For I know that there's victory for me
I've already won because of the blood
Jesus said on Calvary
Triumphant
If I say it until I can see it
Claim it, it's already mine
The power of life and death is in the tongue
I speak life
Triumphant
I am not defeated
Triumphant
The battle's already won
There's a greater power in me
There's a greater power in me
For whatever I lose on earth
Shall be losed in heaven
If I bind it, it's already bound
I've got victory stored up
I'm more than a conquer, yes I am
More than a conquer
More than a conquer
More than a conquer
More than a conquer
Modulate, modulate, modulate, modulate
Modulate, modulate, modulate, modulate
I'm not defeated, I'm not defeated
I'm not defeated, I'm not defeated
I'm more than a conquer
I'm not defeated
I'm not defeated
I'm not defeated
I'm not defeated
