And I have come to this place in my life
I'm full but I've not satisfied
This longing to have more of You
And I can feel it my heart is convinced
And I'm thirsty my soul can't be quenched
You already know this but still
Come and do whatever You want to
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm standing knee deep but I'm out where I've never been
And I feel You coming and I hear Your voice on the wind
Would You come and tear down the boxes that I have tried to put You in?
Let love come teach me who You are again
And would You take me back to the place where my heart was only about You
And all I wanted was just to be with You?
Oh, come and do whatever You want to
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, 'cause further and further my heart moves away from the shore
Whatever it looks like, whatever may come I am Yours
Oh, further and further my heart moves away from the shore
Oh, whatever it looks like, whatever may come I am Yours
