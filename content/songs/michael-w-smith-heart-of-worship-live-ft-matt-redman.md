en the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come
Longin' just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the ways things appear
You're looking into my heart
I'm comin' back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus
King of endless worth
No one could express
How much You deserve?
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is Yours
Every single breath
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart, yeah
I'm comin' back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus
I'm comin' back to the heart of worship
'Cause it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
'Cause it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus, yeah
All about You
I'll bring You more than a song
I'll bring You more than a song, more than a song
I'll bring You more than a song
I'll bring You more than a song (than a song)
You're looking into my heart
You're looking into my heart
You're looking into my heart
Into my heart
I'll bring You more than a song
I'll bring You more than a song, yeah, yeah
I'll bring You more than a song
I'll bring You more than a song
