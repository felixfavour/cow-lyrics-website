You tore the night apart
And ripped the silent skies in half
Your glory breaking through the dark
And here our worlds collide
Divinity in man confined
This great design drawn out for me
Emmanuel
God with us
Emmanuel
Hallelujah
You hold the ends of time
Yet placed Yourself here into mine
My life is now forever changed
Our eyes be lifted up
Our great eternal hope arise
This great design drawn out for me
Emmanuel
God with us
Emmanuel
Hallelujah
