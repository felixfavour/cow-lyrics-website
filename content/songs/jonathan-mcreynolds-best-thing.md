Sometimes life can weigh upon your shoulders (Oh)
Pressure, to heavy for me to shoulder
But when I just hand it over
You take it, Lord, and make it light
Whatever's left, You make it right for me
God, for me

I find my life when I lose it in You (Lose it in You)
I gain control when I give it to You (Give it to You)
I save myself when I let You save me (Let You save me)
Yeah, the best thing I can do for me is You (Oh-oh)
Yeah, the best thing I can do for me is You
Sometimes there are things I question
But I do it without God who answers questions
So I try to figure it out myself but I learned my lesson
You take the load and make it light
Whatever's dim, You make it bright for me yeah
God, for me-e-e-e yeah

I find my life when I lose it in You (Lose it in You)
I gain control when I give it to You, ooh (Give it to You)
I save myself when I let You save me (Let You save me)
Yeah, the best thing I can do for me is You (Oh-oh)
Yeah, the best thing I can do for me is You
[Bridge]
Oh, I
Oh, I
I finally know what real love is like and
Oh, I
Oh, I
And I can't believe it took all this time
Oh, I
Oh, I
I'm glad I got a friend in this fire (I got a friend in this fire)
I love You to life, oh-oh

I find my life when I lose it in You
I gain control when I give it to You, ooh (Give it to You)
I save myself when I let You save me
Yeah, the best thing I can do for me is You
Yeah, the best thing I can do for me is You
