You will recover
He will restore
Be patient, a little longer
He will restore
For each and every tear
He's restoring the years
You've suffered long enough
Now be restored
Your lost won't compare to your gain
Your destiny has been preordained
Your days of hurting are no more
Now be restored
You've suffered long enough
Now be restored
You've suffered long enough
Now be restored
He will perfect you
Establish you
Strengthen you
Settle you
He's restoring
Your family
He's restoring
Your peace
He's restoring
Your wealth
He's restoring
Your health
