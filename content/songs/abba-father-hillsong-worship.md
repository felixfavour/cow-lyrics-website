Abba Father how I love You
Strong hand guides me
A voice that soothes me
And I'm coming to Your open arms again
The more I know You
The more I love You
The more I need
To worship and adore You
Yes I'm coming to Your open arms again
Precious Saviour
My lips will praise You
With all I have with all I am
I will love You
I will love You
Abba Father
You know I love You
You know I need
To worship and adore You
And I'm coming
To Your steadfast love again
