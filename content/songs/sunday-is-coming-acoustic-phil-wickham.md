A great light dawns in Galilee
Some say madman, some say King
Wonder-workin' rebel priest
Jesus Christ the Nazarene
He knew well what it would take
To free us all from sin and grave
A perfect man would have to die
And only He could pay that price
Friday's good 'cause Sunday is comin'
Don't lose hope 'cause Sunday is comin'
Devil, you're done, you better start runnin'
Friday's good 'cause Sunday is comin'
So He let those soldiers take Him in
As His friend betrayed Him with a kiss
And there before the mocking crowd
Like a Lamb to the slaughter, didn't make a sound
Then He carried that cross to Calvary
And He shed His blood to set us free
As the nails went in and the sky went dark
The redemption of the world was on His heart
