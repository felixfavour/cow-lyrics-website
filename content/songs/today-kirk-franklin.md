Everybody wanna be like You they want power and grace like You but
See there is no God like our God there's no one like You
Who gave their life like You and who paid our price like You see
There's only one God that's our God there's no one like You
Who can touch like You or heal us like You do
We stumble and we stray still You always get us through
Who make all things new and comes to our rescue
Death hell and the grave they could not concur You
Became just like me to unlock and set free
This prison that was deep
Rewarded and redeemed the me I could not see
Some may worship things but what joy do they bring
They try to hide mistakes but can they set us free
See where would we without Calvary
A king upon a tree so the whole world can see
You became just like me to unlock and set free
This prison that was deep
Rewarded and redeemed the me I could not see
Healer Father Savior
Counselor Friend Provider
Wasn't sad forever
That's why I just want to be where You are
I'll travel life with You no matter how far
Repeat
