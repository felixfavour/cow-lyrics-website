You know I scare myself, these crazy nights without you
And I feel no pain when I see you cry
We can turn it around now, you're my reason to try
We've all seen some trouble
But we've always come through
You know things could get better
Hey babe, believe me
Tough times don't last, lovers do
Baby, don't give up, on me and you
'Cause trouble's just a storm that's gonna pass
Tough times don't last
We can work so hard, til' we feel the strain
We can get so close, it's the distance we can't explain
Still I reach for you, in the pourin' rain
Like a change in the weather, here comes the sun
Things could only get better
Hey babe, believe me
Tough times don't last, lovers do
Baby, don't give up, on me and you
'Cause trouble's like a storm that's gonna pass
Tough times don't last
