I put it on God
Cause I know Oluwa is involved
E no matter the challenges way I face
I no dey shake And I no dey fear
Many things dey sup
But I just put it on God
I will wait for you
Do everything with you
It can be uncomfortable
So uncomfortable
 na your will be the coco,
stand attention like a poupo,
I go stay where you want stay,
I go where you want go ,
if you say make I no talk,
I can be mute
I can be silent
The pressure don turn me to diamonds
It goes sideways if it's my way I wanna go your way
were da na money or no wahala
me I no fit to bother
I get Holy father
 I put it on God
Cause I know Oluwa is involved
E no matter the  challenges way I face
I no dey shake
And I no dey fear
Many things dey sup
But I just put it on God
cause I know Oluwa is involved E no matter the challenges way I face
I no dey shake
And I no dey fear
many things dey sup
but I just put it on God
Who else
Who else Can I call?
I'm in need of someone
I can't be one
Cause when everything else fails me
Ndoramba ndichichema Ko mwari
Ko mwari
Ndoramba ndichichema
Ndichingochema
I need you to turn up
don't be late
 I put it on God
Cause I know Oluwa s involved
E no matter the challenges wey I face
I no dey shake
And I no dey fear
Many things dey sup
 But I just put it on God
cause I know Oluwa is involved E no matter the challenges way I face
I no dey shake
And I no dey fear
many things dey sup
but I just put it on God
