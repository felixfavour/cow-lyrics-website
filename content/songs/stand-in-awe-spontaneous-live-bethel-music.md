I remember when I met You
The first time that I felt You
When it all was just so simple
I’d just stand in awe of You
I don’t wanna grow familiar
Let my heart stay soft and tender
When You walk into the room
My response is to stand in awe of You
Oh I stand in awe of You, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I stand in awe of You, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I stand in awe of You, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I stand in awe of You
Just to adore You is our purpose
To make Your name higher is our focus
Where we’ve made it complicated
Realign us to stand in awe of You
Come on, sing
Oh I stand in awe of You, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I stand in awe of You, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I stand in awe of You, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I stand in awe of You
