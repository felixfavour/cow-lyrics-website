1: Come be with us, and bless us all,
Holy King,
Rain down thine blessings upon us,
To replenish and to increase in
Celestial,
Halleluyah might be our song.

2: Holy Michael raise up your sword
that we conquer,
All enemies of Celestial,
That the last ship might cleanse the
World on Christ order,
So we might all shout Hosanna.

3: For the pregnant and barren ones be
proud mothers,
May we all not be rejected,
In peace and great joy may we be in
Abundance
That life, salvation be our lot. 
Amen
