At Your name
The mountains shake and crumble
At Your name
The oceans roar and tumble
[Pre-Chorus]
At Your name, angels will bow
The earth will rejoice, Your people cry out
Lord of all the earth
We shout Your name, shout Your name
Filling up the skies with endless praise, endless praise
Yahweh, Yahweh
We love to shout Your name, oh, Lord
At Your name
The morning breaks in glory
At Your name
Creation sings Your story
[Pre-Chorus]
At Your name, angels will bow
The earth will rejoice, Your people cry out
