[Chorus]
When You Walk Into the Room
Everything's changes
Darkness start to trembles
At the Light that You Bring
When You Walk Into the Room
Every Hearts start Burning
Nothing's matters more
Just to sit down at Your Feet and Worship You
Ours Father We Worship You
When You Walk Into the Room
Everything's changes
Darkness start to trembles
At the Light that You Bring
When You Walk Into the Room
Every Hearts start Burning
Nothing's matters more
Just to sit down at Your Feet and Worship You
Ooh yes We Worship You Ooh
[Bridge]
We Loves You
We never stop
We can't lives Without You
JESUS
We Loves You
Can't get enough All this is For You
JESUS
Everything's For You Lord
This is For You Lord
