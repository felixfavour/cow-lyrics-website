[Instrumental]
You set the boundaries for the oceans
You command the wind and waves
Standing over every season
God You reign, You reign
And It's all Yours
The day and the night
The earth and the sky
God it's all Yours
Every breath
We're taking in
We pour out again
In worship
God You authored our beginning
You have numbered all our days
Your love for us is everlasting
Beyond the grave, You reign
And It's all Yours
The day and the night
The earth and the sky
God it's all Yours
Every breath
We're taking in
We pour out again
In worship
And It's all Yours
The day and the night
The earth and the sky
God it's all Yours
Every breath
We're taking in
We pour out again
In worship
