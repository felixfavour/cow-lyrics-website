[Intro]
I called and You came
I called and You came
I called and You came
I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I, I wanna be where You are
Oh, I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I, I wanna be where You are
I wanna be there
I wanna be there
Falling on my knees in worship
Giving all I am to seek Your face
Lord, all I am is Yours
My whole life I place in Your hands
God of Mercy, humbled I bow down
In Your presence, at Your throne
For I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I, I wanna be where You are
I called
For I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I, I wanna be where You are
