SOUND OF REVIVAL Lyrics by GUC

I am the Sound of Revival
The World is Waiting
For me to be Heard
I am the Bible they Read
They would Read Me
And they would be Changed
I am the Sound
Of Many Waters
Flowing from East to the West
Yes and I'm a king
A Wonder to my World
I am the Sound of Revival
The World is Waiting
For me to be Heard
I am the Bible they Read Now
They will Read Me
And they will be Changed
I am the Sound of Revival
The World is Waiting
For me to be Heard
I am the Bible they Read Now
They will Read Me
And they will be Changed

I am REVIVAL
I am REVIVAL, I am REVIVAL
OOH OOH OOH
I am REVIVAL
I am REVIVAL, I am REVIVAL
OOH OOH OOH
[Bridge]

This is our Stand
Many Hoping on Us
Taking Jesus to the World
The World Awaits Us
This is our Stand
Many Hoping on Us
Taking Jesus to the World
The World Awaits Us

I am the Sound of Revival
The World is Waiting
For me to be Heard
I am the Bible they Read Now
They will Read Me
And they will be Changed
I am the Sound of Revival
The World is Waiting
For me to be Heard
I am the Bible they Read Now
They will Read Me
And they will be Changed

I am REVIVAL
I am REVIVAL, I am REVIVAL
OOH OOH OOH
I am REVIVAL
I am REVIVAL, I am REVIVAL
OOH OOH OOH
IYELE, IYELE, IYELE
IYELE, IYELE, IYELE
[Outro]
I am the Sound of Revival
I am the Bible they Read Now
I am REVIVAL
They will Meet me
And be Changed
