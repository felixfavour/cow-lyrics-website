Caught in the half-light, i'm caught alone
Waking up to the sunrise and the radio
Feels like i'm tied up, what's holding me?
Just praying today will be the day i go free
I want to live like there's no tomorrow
I want to dance like no one's around
I want to sing like nobody's listening
Before i lay my body down
I want to give like i have plenty
I want to love like i'm not afraid
I want to be the man i was meant to be
I want to be the way i was made
Made in your likeness, made with your hands
Made to discover who you are and who i am
All i've forgotten help me to find
All that you've promised let it be in my life
[Chorus]
