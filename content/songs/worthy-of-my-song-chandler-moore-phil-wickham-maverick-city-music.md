I'm gonna sing
'Til my heart starts changing
Oh, I'm gonna worship
'Til I mean every word
'Cause the way I feel
And the fear I'm facing
Doesn't change who You are
Or what You deserve (Come on)
[Chorus: Phil Wickham & Chandler Moore]
I give You my worship
You still deserve it
You're worthy, You're worthy
You're worthy of my song
I'll pour out Your praises
In blessing and breaking
You're worthy, You're worthy
You're worthy of my song
[Post-Chorus: Chandler Moore, 
Phil Wickham
]
You are, You are
Yes, You are, 
yes
, You are, Jesus
You are, You are
Forever You're worthy
You are worthy, oh
