I've come to say how much
I love You
I've come to say how much
I adore You
Lord I'm not here to complain
About my many problems
By Your spirit and Your grace
I'm confident You'll solve them
I'm here to say
I love You
I'm here to say
I adore You
I'm here to say
I love you
I love to love You Lord
I love to love You Lord
I've come to say
How much I need You
The longing of my heart
Is to please You
Let Your all-consuming fire
Cleanse me in Your presence
Lord my goal and my desire
Is to serve and give You reverence
