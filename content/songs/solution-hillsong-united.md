It is not a human right to stare not fight
While broken nations dream
Open up our eyes so blind that we might find
The mercy for the need
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey now fill our hearts with Your compassion
Hey now as we hold to our confession
It is not too far a cry too much to try
And help the least of these
Politics will not decide if we should rise
And be Your hands and feet
[Pre-Chorus]
Hey now fill our hearts with Your compassion
Hey now as we hold to our confession
Woah oh oh
God be the solution
Woah oh oh
And we will be Your hands and be Your feet
