My past embraced
My sin forgiven
I'm blameless in Your sight
My history rewritten
My past embraced
My sin forgiven
I'm blameless in Your sight
My history rewritten
'Cause You delight in showing mercy
And mercy triumphs over judgment
I know that You delight in showing mercy
And mercy triumphs over judgment
Oh love, great love
Fear cannot be found in You
There will never be a day
That You're uncertain of the ones You choose, yeah
'Cause You delight in showing mercy
And mercy triumphs over judgment
