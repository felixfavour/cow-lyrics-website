God almighty, we give You praise
For we are fearfully and wonderfully made
Sons and daughters, we stand unashamed
As we lift up Your name, Oh Most High
'Cause You are great and mighty
Give Him praise
Give Him praise
Give Him praise
Like this, oh, oh, oh, oh
Give Him praise
Give Him praise
Give Him praise
Like this, oh, oh, oh, oh
So now there's two and one
We will praise You, Lord, for the marvelous things You've done
We will be filled with joy because of You
We'll sing praise to Your name, Oh Most High
'Cause You are great and mighty
Give Him praise
Give Him praise
Give Him praise
Like this, oh, oh, oh, oh
