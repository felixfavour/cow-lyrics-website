[Chorus]
If I never get that house, that car
Or be a superstar
And my dreams never come true
Will I be satisfied with You?
And if no one ever knows my name
And my gifts don't bring me fame
If everything I have someday I lose
Will I be satisfied with You?
Don't get me wrong, it'd be nice to have nice things and
Everybody loves the love that all those nice things bring but
When the lights turn out and it's just me and You
When You ask me to choose what will I do?
See, if I gain the world then I lose my soul
Who'll stick by my side when my years grow old? So
It's nice easy but when I think of You
I want to be satisfied with You
If I never get that house, that car
Or be a superstar
And my dreams never come true
Will I be satisfied with You?
And if no one ever knows my name
And my gifts don't bring me fame
If everything I have someday I lose
Will I be satisfied with You?
