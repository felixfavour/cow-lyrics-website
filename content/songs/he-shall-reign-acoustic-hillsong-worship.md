Holy, holy, holy
Our God is on the throne
So firm is His foundation
No power can overthrow
And He shall reign forever and ever
One name outlasts the ages
Through time His truth revealed
While kings may pass like shadows
Our God is sovereign still
And He shall reign forever and ever
And He shall reign forever and ever
[Bridge]
To the Lamb upon the throne
Hallelujah, hallelujah
To the Lord forevermore
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
