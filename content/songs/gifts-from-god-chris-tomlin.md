Back when I was a kid
I thought gifts from God only came from church
But the more that I live, the more I learn
It's not always the way it works
Sometimes you don't see it 'til you're looking back
When you didn't get to what you thought, you had to have
'Cause He had a bigger plan than the one you had
Yours didn't work out and aren't you glad
When you take a look around, it ain't hard to find
Everybody's got the things that money can't buy
If the ones you love are sitting right beside you
Then I say you got a lot
The best things in life are straight from His hands
Like the raising kids on a piece of land
A little peace of mind when the day is done
Where you think that comes from? That's gifts from God
Oh, yeah
It makes you thankful for the hills that we climb, for the waves that we ride
For the lows and the highs, for the wrongs made right
For the songs we sing, for the dreams we dream
Makes you thankful for everything
