Have you heard of the One called Saviour
Have you heard of His perfect love
Have you heard of the One in heaven
Have you heard how He gave His Son
'Cause I have found this love
I believe in the Son
Show me Your way
I believe in the One called Saviour
I believe He's the Risen One
I believe that I'll live forever
I believe that the King will come
'Cause I have found this love
I believe in the Son
Show me Your way
Jesus You are my best friend
And You will always be
And nothing will ever change that
[Bridge]
Nothing will ever change that
Nothing will ever change that
Nothing will ever change that
