I will sing
For the joy of the Lord has now become my strength
He is my peace and I am satisfied
He's taken the sorrow
Given a new song to sing
Forever I will sing oh I will sing
Forever I will sing oh I will sing
Oh wow
Oh wow
I will sing
For the joy of the lord has now become my strength
He is my peace and I am satisfied
he's taken the sorrow
Given a new song to sing
Forever I will sing oh I will sing
Forever I will sing oh I will sing
I will sing
I will sing
Forever I will sing
I will sing and shout of your mercies
I will sing and shout of your beauty
I will sing
To the one in whom I live and live eternally (x2)
Oh I will
sing(sing)
For the joy of the lord has now become my strength
He is my peace and I am satisfied
He's taken the sorrow
Given a new song to sing
Forever I will sing oh I will sing
Forever I will sing oh I will sing
Forever I will sing oh I will sing
Of your mercies I will sing
Of your beauty  I will sing
Ohhh forever I will sing oh I will sing

Forever I will sing oh I will sing
