I will keep my mind stayed on you
All I want to do is to worship you
For you are great and greatly to be praised
You alone are God
Oh Lord, you alone are God
Not man o, you alone are God
Yeah, you alone are God
Come on everybody say...
You alone are God
(Not Muhammed, not christian)
You alone are God
(No other but you Lord, no other God)
You alone are God
(We give you the glory, give you the honour God)
You alone are God
You alone are God
You alone are God
You alone are God
You alone are God
And I keep mind stayed on you
Oh lord
All I wanna do, to do
Is to worship you
You alone are God
You alone are God
