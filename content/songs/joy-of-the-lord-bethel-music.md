(chanting in tongues)
Spring up, o well!
Spring up, o well!
(chanting in tongues)
You turn my mourning into joy, my mourning into joy
You break depression!
You turn my mourning into joy!
O Jesus, you break depression
You break depression!
Let freedom reign!
Let freedom reign!
Let freedom reign!
Break off the change!
Break off the change!
Let freedom reign!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord
Is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord
Is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord
Is our strength!
Over every problem, and every possibility
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord
Is our strength!
Joy, joy, joy
Overflowing joy
Overflowing joy
Overflowing joy that breaks depression
That breaks depression!
Overflowing joy!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord
Is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord
Is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord
Is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord
Is our strength!
The joy of the Lord, the joy of the Lord
Is our strength!
