Humbly I wait
Here in Your presence
Oh, how I need You
Quiet my soul
I long for Your whisper
Oh, how I need You
[Pre-Chorus]
Je-e-sus, Je-e-sus
As I worship in surrender
I feel Heaven drawing closer
As I lay down my defenses
Your love invades
And I brace for the impact
I am undone
Lost in Your glory
Oh, how I love You
Covered in grace
Found in Your mercy
Oh, how I love You
