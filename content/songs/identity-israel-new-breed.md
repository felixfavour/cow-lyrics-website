[Intro: Israel Houghton]
One of the things plaguing our generation
Is people trying to figure out who they are
This is a song to our generation
We bare the name of the Father
And in Him we find our identity
You are my Father
You are my Father
You hold my future and destiny
You are my Father
You are my Father
In You I find my identity, yeah
In You I find my identity
You are my Father
You are my Father
You hold my future and destiny, hey yeah yeah
You are my Father
You are my Father
In You I find my identity
In You I find my identity
[Instrumental]
