*lyrics not final
Why are You so good to me?
Why are You so good to me?
You must see a treasure hidden underneath
Why are You so good to me?
This is more than I deserve
This is more than I deserve
Overwhelming grace I could never earn
This is more than I deserve
In the morning, I will sing of how You love me
In the evening, I will bless Your name
Itâ€™s amazing when I think of the way You saved me
Every breath I breathe is for Your praise
I love how You loved me first
I love how You loved me first
You called me from the grave and pulled me from the dirt
I love how You loved me first
You called me from the grave and pulled me from the dirt
I love how You loved me first
