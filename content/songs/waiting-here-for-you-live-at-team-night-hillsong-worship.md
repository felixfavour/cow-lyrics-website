If faith can move the mountains
Let the mountains move
We come with expectation
Waiting here for you, waiting here for you
You're the Lord of all creation
And still you know my heart
The author of salvation
You've loved us from the start
Waiting here for you
With our hands lifted high in praise
And it's you we adore
Singing Alleluia
You are everything you've promised
Your faithfulness is true
And we're desperate for your presencе
All we need is you
Waiting here for you, Lord
With our hands liftеd high in praise
And it's you, Lord, we adore
Singing Alleluia
