Oh, God of creation
There at the start
Before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark
And fleshed out the wonder of light
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath, the planets form
And if the stars were made to worship, so will I
And I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star a signal fire of grace
And if creation sings Your praises, so will I, yeah
God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void, no, no
For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice, woah-oh-oh
And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
And if it all reveals Your nature, so will I
'Cause I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky a canvas of Your grace
And if creation still obeys You, so will I
So will I
So will I
