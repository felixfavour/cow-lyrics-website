The King of Glory Reigns
Over all the world
His mighty hand sustains
The heavens and the earth
Who may come to Him
And seek His holy face?
[Pre-Chorus]
He calls the pure in heart
All whose hands are clean
And those who love His name
Above all other things
Humbly I will bow
And Jesusâ€™ Name confess
He reigns, He reigns
Jesus the Lord
He reigns, He reigns
Forevermore
[Pre-Chorus]
Swing wide you ancient gates
Let the King come in
His glory never fades
Our hearts delight in Him
Every knee will bow
Every tongue confess
