VERSE 1
O how high would I climb mountains
If the mountains were where You hide
O how far I'd scale the valleys
If You graced the other side
VERSE 2
O how long have I chased rivers
From lowly seas to where they rise
Against the rush of grace descending
From the source of its supply
PRE-CHORUS 1
In the highlands and the heartache
You're neither more or less inclined
I would search and stop at nothing
You're just not that hard to find
CHORUS
So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise You when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same
VERSE 3
O how far beneath Your glory
Does Your kindness extend the path
From where Your feet rest on the sunrise
To where You sweep the sinner's past
VERSE 4
O how fast would You come running
If just to shadow me through the night
Trace my steps through all my failure
And walk me out the other side
PRE-CHORUS 2
For who could dare ascend that mountain
That valleyed hill called Calvary
But for the One I call Good Shepherd
Who like a lamb was slain for me
BRIDGE
Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent
PRE-CHORUS 3
From the gravest of all valleys
Come the pastures we call grace
A mighty river flowing upwards
From a deep but empty grave
