water you turn into wine
open the eyes of the blind
there is no one like you
none like you
into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there is no one like you
none like you
our God greater
our God is stronger
God you are higher than any other
Our God is healer
awesome and power of God
into the darkness you shine
out of the ashes we rise
there is no one like you
none like you
our God is greater
our God is stronger
God you are higher than any other
our God is healer
awesome and power of God
of God
our God is greater
our God is stronger
God you are higher than any other
our God is healer
awesome and power of God
and if our God is for us
then who could ever stop us
and if our God is with us
then what can stand against
and if our God is for us
then who could ever stop us
and if our God is with us
then what can stand against
then what can stand against
our God greater
our God is stronger
God you are higher than any other
our God is healer
