Who could know Your thoughts, who could grasp Your ways?
Who could match Your goodness or deny Your grace?
You awake my soul, captivate my heart
Oh, God, how great You are
You command the laws of the universe
Burning bright with glory, infinite in worth
With a single word, You ignite the stars
Oh, God, how great You are
I stand in awe of You
I stand in awe of You
"Christ, the Way, the Life and the Truth"I stand in awe of You
What King would leave his throne, set his crown aside
For his own creation and bear their sin and die?
Unrelenting love, never-ending grace
Oh, God, we praise Your name
I stand in awe of You
I stand in awe of You
"Christ, the Way, the Life and the Truth"I stand in awe of You, yeah
