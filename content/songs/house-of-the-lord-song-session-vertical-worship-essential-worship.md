We worship the God who was
We worship the God who is
We worship the God who evermore will be
He opened the prison doors
He parted the raging sea
My God, He holds the victory
There's joy in the house of the Lord
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise
There's joy in the house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place
And wе won't be quiet
We shout out Your praisе
(Oh-oh-oh) We shout out Your praise
We sing to the God who heals
We sing to the God who saves
We sing to the God who always makes a way
'Cause He hung up on that Cross
Then He rose up from that grave
My God's still rolling stones away
