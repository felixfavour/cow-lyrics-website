I take the bread of life
Broken for all my sin
Your body crucified
To make me whole again
I will recall the cup
Poured out in sacrifice
To trade this sinner's end
For Your new covenant
Hallelujah
I'll live my life in remembrance
Hallelujah
Your promise I won't forget
I'll walk salvation's road
With fear and trembling
Your way borne as my own
As Christ is formed in me
Hallelujah
I'll live my life in remembrance
Hallelujah
Your promise I won't forget
