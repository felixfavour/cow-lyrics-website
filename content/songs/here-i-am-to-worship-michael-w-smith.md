Light of the World
You stepped down into darkness
Open my eyes let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
King of all days
Oh, so highly exalted
Glorious in Heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created
All for love's sake became poor
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
