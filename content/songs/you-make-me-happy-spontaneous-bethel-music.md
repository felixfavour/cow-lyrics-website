[Intro: Spoken]
Just press in to Him tonight
Let's turn your affection towards Him
We set our gaze on You
We put our attention on You
All of our love is for You
You're the reason why we breathe
You're the air that I breathe, oh
You bring calm to the storm
You bring life to me
And You're the air that I breathe
And I love You, God
I love You, God
I just love You, God
I just love You, God
Lift your voices, I just love You, God
I bring You a real song
I just love You, God
I just love You, oh
[Post-Chorus]
Lift up your own song
Lift up your own heart cry
From where you're at tonight, start to sing it out
