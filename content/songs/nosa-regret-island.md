gret island
You are always on my mind
I had it coming
When I tried to bide my time
Regret island
Light girl, you were shining
My world, it was timing
Bright pearl, yeah you're blinding, you
You were nice, but I was so far
Saw your eyes
And all of these scars
Didn't mind, but you were so afraid what I'll say
So you hide all away
Whilst I asked you to stay
I got all confused
Made my ego feel bruised
Said how much you want me
You never told me
My mind in the dark
Left your heart with a mark
Had to save me from you
What you might go do
So I just walked away
Couldn't look at your face
Your perfect face
You are always on my mind
I had it coming
When I tried to bide my time
Regret island
You are always on my mind
I had it coming
When I tried to bide my time
Regret island
Hindsight, that's my trademark
Brake lights, in the car park
Those nights, that I spent with you
Incite, feelings of temper
When I felt just like a member
Of a club dedicated to you
My trust was so low
Buried deep in the snow
A reflection of me
Handled me like a queen
When we parted I learned
The cold it can burn
I can see all my faults
The truth and the false
Still it hurt to lose you
Reality skewed
Only worsened my mood
Because I was clued
And I tried not to lose
To a game you didn't play
You didn't play
You are always on my mind
I had it coming
When I tried to bide my time
Regret island
You are always on my mind
I had it coming
When I tried to bide my time
Regret island
