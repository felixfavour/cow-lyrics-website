What gift of love could I offer to a King
What weight or worth could be held within my offering
When He alone is worthy
A glory song is inscribed upon my heart
This treasure held in an alabaster jar I break
To bring Him all the glory
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
What sacrifice could be equal to His own
The cross of Christ has declared that there is nought I owe
Yet I know I owe Him all
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
[Bridge]
Our Father God the infinite
The matchless King magnificent
The living Christ, the servant Son
The prophesied, the saving One
The Holy Ghost gift from above
The faithful Friend, the seal of love
This life this heart, this song to Him
My all in all, my everything
