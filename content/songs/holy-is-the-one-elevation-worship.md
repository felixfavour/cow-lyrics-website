You left your glory
To join in our story
You came to redeem us
'cause we were in need of you
To bring your salvation
You took up our cross and we cry
Chorus:
Holy is the one
Who gave his only son for us
We were dead in sin
You gave us life and made us whole again
Verse
Chorus
Bridge:
We are the redeemed
The ones who are free
Freed in your name, God
We lift up a shout
Our praise is loud
Our praise is loud
