Jesus, all-glorious
Prepare in us Your temple
We're called as living stones
Where You're enthroned
And as You rose from death in power
So rise within our worship
Rise upon our praise
And let the hand that saw You raised
Clothe us in Your glory
And draw us by Your grace
Oh, the glory of Your presence
We Your temple give You reverence
So arise to Your rest
And be blessed by our praisе
And as we glory in Your embrace
And as Your prеsence now fills this place
Sing, "Jesus"Jesus, all-glorious
Prepare in us Your temple
We're called as living stones
Where You're enthroned
