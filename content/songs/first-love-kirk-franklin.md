[Intro]
I just wanna talk to somebody right now
Who's been gone away for a long time
You don't have to run no more
You can come back home
I know they hurt you
They saw you stumble but didn't help you
And now they left you
They were quick to pray but slow to move
And now you're empty
Too tired to run, you walk away
In the night there's a voice if you listen
He sweetly says
[Hook]
Come back to your first love, first love
Come back to your first love, first love
Come back home
Back where you belong
Come back to your, to your
First love
First love
First love
First love
First love
First love
First love
