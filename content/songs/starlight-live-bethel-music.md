You're like starlight in the dark
Endless miles can't conceal You
And every glimmer is a spark
Catching fire as You break through
Oh, You're not far away
You're coming close
And oh, even as I wait
You're coming close
You're like summer in the night
The sun goes down but still I feel You
And every shadow's turning bright
Every broken heart is made new
Oh, You're not far away
You're coming close
And oh, even as I wait
You're coming close
[Interlude]
