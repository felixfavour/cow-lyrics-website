Trust in the Lord at all times, pour out your heart before Him
Power belongeth to God
God has spoken once, and twice have I heard this
Power belongeth to God
Who can search His understanding? His thoughts higher than ours
All power in His hands, for my life He has a plan
God is our salvation, we find refuge in Him
Power belongs, power belongs to God
Great is our God almighty, and He is strong in battle
Power belongs to our God
Although an host encamp me, encamp and do surround me
Power belongs to our God
I shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor the arrow by day
I'm persuaded come what may
And now troubles behind me, I've got great joy before me
Power belongs, power belongs to God
(Repeat)
There is nothing too hard for God
Nothing too hard for God
Power belongs to God
(Repeat)
Power belongs to God
