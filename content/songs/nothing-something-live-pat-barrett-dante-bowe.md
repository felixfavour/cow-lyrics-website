I could write a melody
That all of Heaven's choir sings
But if I don't have love then it means nothing
And I can spit out some holy word
Something that you've never heard
But if I don't have love it means nothing
[Chorus: Pat Barrett, 
Dante Bowe
]
If I can't love my neighbor like I love myself
If I won't move when my brother cries out for help
If I'm too proud to forgive before the sun goes down
Then this life that I've been living, what does it mean now?
At best, it all means nothing
Without love, it all means nothing
I can dine with kings and queens
My name go down in history
But if I don't have love, it means nothing
So take the old and make me new
Show me how to love like You
'Cause if I don't have love, it means nothing
[Chorus: Dante Bowe, 
Pat Barrett
, 
Dante Bowe & Pat Barrett
]
If I can't love my neighbor like I love myself (
Yeah
), oh
If I won't move when my brother cries out for help
 (Yeah)
If I'm too proud to forgive before the sun goes down
Then this life that I've been living, what does it mean now?
At best it all means nothing
 (Oh, God)
Without love, it all means nothing
 (Oh)
At best it all means nothing
 (Jesus)
Without love, it all means nothing
 (Oh, yeah, yeah)
