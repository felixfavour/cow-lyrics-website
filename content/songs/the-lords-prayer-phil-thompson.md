Our God who art in heaven
Hallowed by Your Holy Name
Give us today our daily bread
Forgive us Lord as we forgive
Let Your kingdom come
Let Your will be done
On earth as in heaven
Let Your glory come
Shining like the sun
Your kingdom reigns
Lead us not into temptation
Deliver us from the evil one
Remind our hearts
You're always with us
And we shall never be afraid
Let Your kingdom come
Let Your will be done
On earth as in hеaven
Let Your glory come
Shining likе the sun
Your kingdom reigns
