What can take a dying man
And raise him up to life again?
What can heal a wounded soul?
What can make us white as snow?
What can fill the emptiness?
What can mend our brokenness?
Brokenness
Mighty, awesome, wonderful
Is the holy cross
Where the lamb laid down His life
To lift us from the fall
Mighty is the power of the cross
What restores our faith in God?
What reveals the Father's love?
What can lead the wayward home?
What can melt a heart of stone?
What can free the guilty ones
What can save and overcome?
Overcome
Mighty, awesome, wonderful
Is the holy cross
Where the lamb laid down His life
To lift us from the fall
Mighty is the power of the cross
