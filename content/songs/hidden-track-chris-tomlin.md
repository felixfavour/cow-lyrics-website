Got a funny feeling
It's making my head kind of sore
Something tells me
She don't love me anymore
Like when she sprayed graffiti
On a gang member's car
And left my phone number on the hood
Or when she wore camouflage
And dressed me as a deer
For a costume party in the woods
Got a funny feeling
It's making my head kind of sore
Something tells me
She don't love me anymore
Like when she tried to iron my shirt
While I still had it on
And now I've got the scars for the proof
Or when she came by my house
Last night to watch the stars
And I broke my leg
When she pushed me off my roof
Got a funny feeling
It's making my head kind of sore
Something tells me
She don't love me anymore
