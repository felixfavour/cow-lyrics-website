You're always there*
When no one else cares
I can depend on you
To guide me through
[2x:]
I worship you
For the rest of my life I will
I yearn for you
For the rest of my life I will
My love grows for you
I yearn, for you presence in my life, for the rest of my life
Sometimes I feel alone, alone... alone...
No one from my family
My friends are goon...
No one else to turn to
So then I cry...
But then you remind me
That you're on my side...
(Back to I worship you)
[Vamp (2x):]
I worship you
I yearn for you
I love you
All praise for you
For the rest of my life
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy. [Repeat:]
