Pour me out x2
All I am is Yours x2
Pour me out x2 (I need You)
All I am is Yours (All I am is Yours)
(Go on say something high say something really high)
.....
Yes Lord
Pour me out x2
All I am is Yours x2
Surround me with Your Glory
And fill me with Your Love
Till I overflow.......
Pour me out x2 All I am is Yours x2
Pour me out x2 All I am is Yours x2
Surround me with Your glory
And fill me with Your love till I overflow...
I step down from the throne of my heart saying
All I am with is Yours o most high
Casting down my crown at Yours.
Yes God
All I am..
I step down O God
I step down from the throne of my heart saying
All I am it was Yours from the start
I set down my crown at Your feet
All I am is Yours
It belongs to the master
I step down from the throne of my heart
Saying  All I am, it was Yours from the start
I set down my crown at Your feet
All I am is Yours x3 (it belongs to You)
