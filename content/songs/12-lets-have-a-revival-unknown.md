Let's have a revival, from the pulpit to the pew, let's have a revival that starts with me and you. Then reaches out to a lost and hungry world to bring them in, this is our joy, it's our survival, let's pray for a Holy Ghost arrival, let's have a revival. 

Sometimes we've just gone through the motions, left the spirit out, no power in our program, no victory in our shout. But God will give us back the joy, let's open up the Bible lay aside formality, let's have a revival. 

Let's have a revival, from the pulpit to the pew, let's have a revival that starts with me and you. Then reaches out to a lost and hungry world to bring them in, this is our joy, it's our survival, let's pray for a Holy Ghost arrival, let's have a revival. 

I asked an old time preacher how revival came back there, he said we always started down on our knees in prayer, just open up the two books, the song book and the Bible. If you sing and preach the word, you'll have a revival. 

Let's have a revival, from the pulpit to the pew, let's have a revival that starts with me and you. Then reaches out to a lost and hungry world to bring them in, this is our joy, it's our survival, let's pray for a Holy Ghost arrival, let's have a revival. 

Let's pray for a Holy Ghost arrival, Let's have a revival.
