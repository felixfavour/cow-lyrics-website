Oh I really love You, I love You tonight
I really love You, I love You tonight
I really love You, sing with me, I love You tonight
I really love You, I love You tonight
Sing out your own song
You’re always beautiful, You’re always strong
You’re always wonderful (We love You)
You’re always beautiful, never changing
Sing I really love You
Oh I really love You, I love You tonight
Oh I really love You, I love You tonight
Oh I really love You, with all we are (I love You tonight)
Oh with everything (Oh I really love You, I love You tonight)
Oh-oh
Like incense rising to Your throne (Oh I really love You, I love You tonight)
This love we have for You and You alone (Oh I really love You)
When we praise You break off all our shame (I love You tonight)
So we praise You with
I really love You, I love You tonight
Oh I really love You, I love You tonight
Ooh, I love You tonight
