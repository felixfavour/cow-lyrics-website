Created from dust
And you came and You lived among us
You took on our frame, You walked in our pain
And now You're taking us higher
And You stepped into time
And You laid down Your life to save us
And You took all our shame
On the cross it was laid
And now You're taking us higher
'Cause we go from glory to glory to glory
We'll never be the same, we'll never be the same
We go from glory to glory to glory
We're forever changed, forever changed
And You call me Your friend
Brought into Your endless kingdom
And by the blood I was made, no longer a slave
And now You're taking us higher
We go from glory to glory to glory
We'll never be the same, we'll never be the same
'Cause we go from glory to glory to glory
We're forever changed, forever changed
Until we reach the day
Love conquers everything
We'll cry an anthem singing
Holy, Holy
And when we see that day
We're standing face to face
We'll shout an anthem singing
Holy, Holy
Until we reach the day
Love conquers everything
We'll cry an anthem singing
Holy, Holy
And when we see that day
We're standing face to face
We'll shout an anthem singing
Holy, Holy
You took on the grave
So not even death can shake us
The victor has won
And Heaven has come
Now You're taking us higher
And now You're taking us higher
We go from glory to glory to glory
We'll never be the same, we'll never be the same
You take us higher and higher and higher
We're forever changed, we're forever changed, yeah
We go from glory to glory to glory
We'll never be the same, we'll never be the same
You take us higher and higher and higher
We're forever changed, forever changed
We go from glory to glory to glory
We go from glory to glory to glory
You take us higher and higher and higher
We're forever changed, forever changed
