Oh, how dark the night that wrapt my spirit round!
Oh, how deep the woe my Savior found
When He walked across the waters of my soul,
Bade my night disperse and made me whole.

Chorus:
All the way to Calvary He went for me,
He went for me, He went for me,
All the way to Calvary He went for me,
He died to set me free.

2 Tremblingly a sinner bowed before his face,
Naught I knew of pardon,â€”God's free grace,
Heard a voice so melting, "Cease thy wild regret,
Jesus bought thy pardon, paid thy debt." [Chorus]

3 Oh, 'twas wondrous love the Savior show'd for me,
When He left His throne for Calvary,
When He trod the winepress, trod it all alone,
Praise His name forever, make it known. [Chorus]
