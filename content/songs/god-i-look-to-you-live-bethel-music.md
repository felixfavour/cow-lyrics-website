God, I look to You
I won't be overwhelmed
Give me vision
To see things like You do
God, I look to You
You're where my help comes from
Give me wisdom
You know just what to do
God, I look to You
I won't be overwhelmed
Give me vision
To see things like You do
God, I look to You
You're where my help comes from
Give me wisdom
You know just what to do
And I will love You, Lord my strength
I will love You, Lord my shield
Oh, I will love You, Lord my rock
Forever all my days, I will love You, God
God, I look to You
I won't be overwhelmed
Give me vision
To see things like You do
God, I look to You
You're where my help comes from
Give me wisdom
You know just what to do
