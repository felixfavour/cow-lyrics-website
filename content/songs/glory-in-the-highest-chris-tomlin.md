You are the first, You go before
You are the last, Lord, You're the encore
Your name's in lights for all to see
The starry host declare Your glory
Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest
Apart from You there is no God
Light of the world, the brightened morning star
Your name will shine for all to see
You are the one, You are my glory
Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest
Glory in the highest
[Bridge]
And no one else could ever compare
To You, Lord
All the earth together declares
