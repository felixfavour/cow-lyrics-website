I am God all by myself
I don't need any help
I can handle things
On my own
I am the first and the last
Whatever you need just ask
For I am, I am, I am God
I was there
In the beginning
And I'll be there when
You get to the end
I'm all seeing
All knowing
Almight
Evershowing
For I am, I am, I am God
BRIDGE
All my promises are yea
I am God
All my promises are yea
I am God
I am the first, the last
Whatever you need
Just ask
For I am, I am, I am God
