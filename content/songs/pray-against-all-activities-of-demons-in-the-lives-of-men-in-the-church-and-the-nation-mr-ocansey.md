 Mark 16:17 KJV 
And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;

ðŸŒ· Pray fervently in tongues of the Spirit over individuals, families, the Church and our nations. Nullify every activity of demons to cause Unbelief, Gossip, Sickness or Poverty. We cut off their activities, render them ineffective and cast them out in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus. We declare that their works are completely terminated and we cast them out to uninhabited regions of the earth.* 

 2 
Acts 19:20 KJV 
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
ðŸŒ· We decree that the gospel is proliferating supernaturally and bringing light to every vacuum of darkness in our nations and in the hearts of men. We decree that the word of God is growing mightily and is accepted in our day and age ushering a dispensation of righteousness, peace, progress, prosperity, health and wellness. In the Name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.
