I rest my soul on Jesus
When the mountains shake
I put my trust in Jesus
The moment I awake
And when my soul is lost at sea
He will be my rock
My vision be in Christ alone
This grace is all we've got
His love is like the mighty ocean
His love for me will never stop
Oh, His arms are strong enough to carry me
Through it all, by the grace of God
So high upon His shoulders
Safely brought this far
Oh, helper of my helpless soul
The King of broken hearts
His love is like the mighty ocean
His love for me will never stop
Oh, His arms are strong enough to carry me
Through it all, by the grace of God
