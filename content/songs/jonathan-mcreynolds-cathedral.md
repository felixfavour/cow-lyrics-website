I don't have a perfect record
I still have a blemished heart
I don't have much worth without Ya
I am good because You are
Take this lump of clay and
Build Yourself a place in it
Make a cathedral out of me
Make a cathedral out of me
Make a cathedral out of me
Make a cathedral out of me
I feel small just talking to Ya
Wondering what You think of me
I don't have to much to say
You still listen when I sing
Take this lump of clay and
Make Yourself an instrument
Make a cathedral out of me
Make a cathedral out of me
Make a cathedral out of me
Make a cathedral out of me
You see the light in the dark
You make a temple inside of my heart
You see the saint inside every sinner
Take Your lump of clay and
Love it till it can't resist
Make a cathedral out of me
Make a cathedral out of me
Make a cathedral out of me
Make a cathedral out of me
Make a believer out of me
Make a believer out of me
Make a man of God out of me
Make a worshipper out of me
Make a cathedral out of me
Make this six-foot lump of clay, look more like You everyday
