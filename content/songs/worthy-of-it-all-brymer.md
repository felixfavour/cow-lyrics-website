All the saints and angels
they bow before Your throne
all the elders cast their crowns 
before the Lamb of God and sing

You are worthy of it all,
You are worthy of it all,
For from You are all things
And to You are all things
You deserve the glory

Day and night, night and day
Let incense arise
Day and night, night and day
Let incense arise
(repeat)

You are worthy of it all,
You are worthy of it all,
For from You are all things
And to You are all things
You deserve the glory
