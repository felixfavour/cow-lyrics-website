Caught in your fire
Caught in your flame
You're circling out my name
Will love you right in the distance, in the same place
In different ways
However you should ask me, I'll answer the same
My hearts on the plate for you
You could have yea.. you own it all
I been down but you held me up
Had me the whole time, all of my days
You're never the one to wait..
In blotting out my transgression, all of my shame
You're numbing all of my pain
Adios.. I'll never say, no
I never say no
I'll be damned if I gave you up
I'll be lying if I ever said I had enough.
Oh!
Got me calling your name
Oh
We are one and the same
You're the one who holds my today and my tomorrow
My life's not borrowed.
Bab'alade n'pe mi Sara sile
O'n famimora wole
Mo ni fokanbale di o o
Daju Daju Mon yi o o
Bere'topin metalokan aye o
Onimajemumi Halle o
Mo ni fokanbale di o o
Daju Daju Mon yi o o
Dress the Lilies
Splendour it out
Should I ever have a doubt
That you're with me here and now
Oh I know you made the vow
Dress the Lilies
Splendour it out
Know you're with me here and now
Oh I know you made the vow
Got my feet on solid grounds
Got my head up in the clouds
Oh!
Got me calling your name
Oh
We are one and the same
You're the one who holds my today and my tomorrow
My life's not borrowed.
Bab'alade n'pe mi Sara sile
O'n famimora wole
Mo ni fokanbale di o o
Daju Daju Mon yi o o
Bere'topin metalokan aye o
Onimajemumi Halle o
Mo ni fokanbale di o o
Daju Daju Mon yi o o
