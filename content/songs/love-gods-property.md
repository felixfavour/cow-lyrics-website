[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Patient love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Patient love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Patient love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Patient love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Patient love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Love, a word that comes and goes
But few people really know what it means to really love somebody
Love, though the tears may fade away, I'm so glad your love will stay
Cause I love you and you show me, Jesus, what it really means to love
[Hook: Kirk Franklin]
Patient love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Patient love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Love, a word that comes and goes
But few people really know what it means to really love somebody
Love, though the tears may fade away, I'm so glad your love will stay
Cause I love you and you show me, Jesus, what it really means to love
[Bridge: God's Property]
The nights that I cry, you love me
When I should have died, you love me
I'll never know why you love me
It's a mystery to me now I'm glad that I can see Jesus
When all hope was gone, you love me
You gave me a song that you love me
Now I can go on cause you love me
It's a mystery to me now I'm glad that I can see Jesus
