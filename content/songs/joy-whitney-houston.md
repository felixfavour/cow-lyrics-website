[Chorus]
Oh joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh, joy, joy, joy in my soul
Listen to the music
The sound of the angels
Come and see the child
Who can make you whole
Lying in a manger
Away from harm and danger
Oh joy in my soul
Oh joy, joy down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy
Oh joy, joy, joy in my soul
Joy, joy, joy in my soul oh
He sent from up above
This special gift of love
More precious than silver or gold
He was sent this holiday
To take our pain away
