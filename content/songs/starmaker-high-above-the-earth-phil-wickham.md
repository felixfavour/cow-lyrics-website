[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-
Starmaker
Standing high above
Wrapped in light and crowned in love
Dark shaker, it trembles at Your name
And here with You, we are amazed
[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't look away, I am captivated
What else can I say? But sing in adoration
"You are Holy, You are Holy high above the earth
You are Holy, You are Holy high above the earth"[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh) oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Creator, what mysteries You hold?
Your words worth more than wells of gold
Soul waker, You bring our hearts to life
And here with You, we're satisfied
