V1
I   feel   a   change
I   feel   you   moving   me
Youâ€™re   taking   my   pain
Turning   it   into   praise
I   feel   a   wind
Something   is   happening
Heaven   rush   in
Spirit   Awaken   me
Chorus
Oh   oh   oh
Holy   Spirit   come
Oh   oh   oH
Holy   Spirit   come   take   over
V2
I   hear   a   sound
I   see   your   glory   here
Where   angels   surround
And   sorrows   have   disappeared
I   sense   your   touch
Your   presence   is   healing   me
Washed   in   your   love
Changed   for   eternity
