I don't care what they say about me
It's all right, all right
I don't care they think about me
It's all right, they'll get it one day
[Pre-Chorus]
I love you, I'll follow you
You are my, my life
I will read my bible and pray
I will follow you all day
I don't care what it costs anymore
Cos' you gave it all and I'm following you
I don't care what it takes anymore
No matter what happens I'm going your way
Pre-Chorus
Chorus:
All Day
All Day now
All Day
Verse 1
