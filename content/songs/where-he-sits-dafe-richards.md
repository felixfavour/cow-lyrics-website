  Where He sits , I now sit at the right hand of the Father.
  That's my portion, my conviction
  That's where I'll ever be .
  
  
  He's in me, I'm in Him
  We are one with the Father
  That's my portion, my conviction
  That's where I'll ever be
  
  
  Your love has found me
  Your love has made me who I am
