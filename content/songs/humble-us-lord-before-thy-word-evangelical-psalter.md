1.	HUMBLE us, Lord, before Thy Word,
   All needy souls alike to Thee;
As gracious wisdom now is heard,
    Impress our minds to hear and see.
 	
2.  Quell our vain trust in rank and wealth,
    Our moral helplessness lay bare;
For who can buy a place in Heaven,
    Or give a ransom to be there?
 	
3.  How costly is the soul’s release From death’s eternal agony!
A price that none can pay, but One
    Who came and died to set us free.
 	
4.  The foolish and the wise alike,
    Must forfeit all they hold so dear;
And, though they sweep aside the thought,
    Submit to death’s decisive hour.
 	
5.  O bless us now, lest we should spurn
    The light of grace, the saving Word;
And through self-adulation go,
    Stripped of all good, to meet our God.
 	
6.  Lord, stir our souls, lest we should be
    Judged with the lost when death shall fall;
O may we taste converting grace,
    And hear and love the Gospel call
