There is none like You
No one else can touch my heart like you do
And I can search for all eternity long
And find, there is none like You

You mercy flows like river wide
And healing comes from your hands
Suffering children are safe in your arms
There is none like You

There is none like You
No one else can touch my heart like you do
And I can search for all eternity long
And find, there is none like You

And I can search for all eternity long
And find
There is none
There is none
There is none like You
