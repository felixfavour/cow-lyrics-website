[Chorus]
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Everything is shimmering with glory
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Here and now
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Everything is shimmering with glory
Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
Here and now
They said I was broken
Unholy in my sin
So I hid in the garden
Hardened and masked
Then my eyes were opened
You called me forgiven
I was never broken
Only ever loved as is
All of life is holy
Every kind of body
There is nothing missing
Unseen, lost, unloved
Holy, holy, holy (Holy, holy)
God sings to her babies:
"I have made you worthy
By loving everything as is"
