yea
I lift my hands, I lift my voice
I shout aloud and make some noise
Cos Christ in me, am filled with Joy
Cos, if it sickness, I am healed
If it's death, it's been defeated
If it's danger, he is my sheild
I can live my victory receiving.
Yes, it's already done
it's already done
it's already done
it's already done
Everything that I need
Is already done
it's already done
it's already done
it's already done
it's already done
Everything that I need
Is already done.
am goinna enter greater things
more of his love
the more i grow i possess
cause in Him i know all my need are met
Yes, it's already done
it's already done
it's already done
it's already done
Everything that I need
Is already done
am already healed
am already saved
am already righteous
i've already won
Everything that I need
Is already done.
it's already done
it's already done
it's already done

Everything that I need

everything that i need
is already done
thank you Jesus
