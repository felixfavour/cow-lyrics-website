I feel so many times
lost in my way
consume by every lair
you seem far away
death try to hold me down
but you save the way
none of this stands between us
cuz you made the way
oh hohoho
the price that you paid on the cross for me
oh hohoho hoho
oh hohoho
the blood that you sade on calvary
oh I can boldly say
calvary calvary calvary
is calling me
calvary calvary calvary is calling my name
calvary calvary calvary is calling me
calvary is my name.
calvary calvary is
calling my name
just to remind me that my
dept has been paid
nothing can hold me down now
no, not the death
now, nothing stands between us
you are the way
chorus: oh hohoho
the price that you paid on the cross for me
oh hohohoho
