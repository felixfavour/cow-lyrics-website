Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling, too
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Outside, the snow is falling, and friends are calling, "yoo-hoo!"Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap
It's grand just holding your hand
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland
Our cheeks are nice and rosy, and comfy-cozy are we
We're snuggled up together like birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
Rap:
There's ice on the pond and chill in the breeze
You look a little colder, get closer to me
Yeah, I like it like that with you under my arm
This is a really cool job, keepin' you cozy and warm
The stars are so bright and the sky is so blue
I think that moon was made just for me and you
Hear the sounds of the bells going ring-a-ling-a-ling
I really do like this sleigh-ridin' thing
You're lookin' so cute in your sleigh-ridin' suit
Even the horse turned around and winked at you
I know I'm the envy of all of the guys
I feel like the winner, and you are the prize
The ground is covered over with a blanket of snow
To snuggle up to you I don't think about the cold
Let's slip a little sigh and sing another tune
It's so much fun sleigh-ridin' with you
