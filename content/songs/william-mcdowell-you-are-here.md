you are here
you are here now
Have your way as we bow down
here I am drawn by your presences
As I stand on holy ground
when you speak everything changes
and I will never be the same
you are here
you are here now
have your way as we bow down
lord you hear the cry of your people
how we long for more of you when you move everything changes we will never be the same
you are here
you are here now
have your way as we bow down
Take control here right now
take control here right now
you are here
you are here now
have your way as we bow down
