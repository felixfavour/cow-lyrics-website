See Him now, the King of heaven
Son of God, enthroned above
Heavy cross upon His shoulders
Carried for us, carried for us
See Him now, our King surrendered
Final word of perfect love
Hear His cry, "Father, forgive them"Spoken for us, spoken for us
[Pre-Chorus 1]
When He said, "It is finished"Oh our hope had just begun
The grave has lost its hold
Arise the stone is gone
Our God reigns forevermoreÂ 
All praise to Him belongs
Lift high His name alone
Jesus came, paid it all
Then He rose, then He rose
Now we arise by His spirit
In His name we overcome
All our hope, in this same power
Living in us, living in us
