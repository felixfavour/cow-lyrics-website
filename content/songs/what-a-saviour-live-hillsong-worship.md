What a Savior my Redeemer
Friend of sinners one like me
Oh what kindness suffered violence
Healed my blindness and set me free
Oh what grace I've found in You my Jesus
That my soul should entertain Your greatness
Should this life hold nothing but my Savior
I will praise You
Always
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, oooh)
A heaven's glory clothed in mercy
Knew my story yet took my end
Though I'm freedom hope like heaven
Now forgiven I will rise again
Oh what grace I've found in You my Jesus
That my soul should entertain Your greatness
Should this life hold nothing but my Saviour
I will praise You
Always
