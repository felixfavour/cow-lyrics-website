Angels, angels in the night
Angels, angels from on high
Messengers of grace
Messengers of light
Angels, angels fill the skies
Angels from the highest height
Glory all around
Heaven reaching out
A song we'd never heard
How beautiful the sound
Singing Gloria
Gloria
Singing Gloria
Gloria
This day a Saviour has been born
Jesus, He is Christ the Lord
This will be a sign, you will find a child
And suddenly the sky was filled with sacred choir
