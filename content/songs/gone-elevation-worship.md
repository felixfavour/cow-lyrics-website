[Intro]
Come on
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
It wasn't for nothing that You shed Your blood
So I'm gonna live like my shame is gone
Won't be shackled to the way I was
Oh, I'm gonna live like my chains are
Gone, gone
Now my sin is dead and gone
And I sing hallelujah
Done, done
He is risen, it is done
And I sing hallelujah
(Whoa, whoa)
Praise is a weapon that will overcome
Oh, I'm gonna shout like the battle's won
Fall back devil 'cause your time is up
Oh, I'm gonna live like the stone is
