Friends Don’t Worry Bout This Heavy Load I Carry. Don’t Be Concerned If It Sends Me To My Knees. For I Know A Place Where All My Load Will Lighten.
I’ll Be All Right As Soon As I Touch Calvary.

If My Feeble Hand Of Faith, Could Only Reach Out. Thru This Dark And Dreary Storm Of Unbelief If He’ll Slip His Nail Scared Hand Into My Hand. I’ll Be All Right As Soon As I Touch Calvary.

Very Soon, I’ll Reach That Hill Golgotha. I’ll Touch That Cross That Was Fashioned From A Tree.
And If Just One Precious Drop Of His Blood Touches Me. I’ll Be All Right As Soon As I Touch Calvary.

If My Feeble Hand Of Faith, Could Only Reach Out. Thru This Dark And Dreary Storm Of Unbelief If He’ll Slip His Nail Scared Hand Into My Hand. I’ll Be All Right As Soon As I Touch Calvary.
