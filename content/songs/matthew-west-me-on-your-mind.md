I've read the words in red
How You leave the ninety-nine
To find the one missing, feels like that was written
With me on Your mind
And the prodigal son who ran
Leaving his home behind
The part were the father came running to meet him
Did You say that with me on Your mind?
Who am I that the King of the world
Would give one single thought about my broken heart?
Who am I that the God of all grace
Wipes the tears from my face and says, "Come as you are"?
You paid the price, You took thÐµ cross
You gave Your life and You did it all
With me on Your mind (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
MÐµ on Your mind (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
Just knowing You're mindful of me
Just knowing You call me Your child
It's flooding my soul with unspeakable hope
Thank You, Lord, that it's me on Your mind

Who am I that the King of the world
Would give one single thought about my broken heart?
Who am I that the God of all grace
Wipes the tears from my face and says, "Come as you are"?
You paid the price, You took the cross
You gave Your life and You did it all
With me on Your mind (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
There was me on Your mind (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
Oh-oh (Hallelujah)
Thank You, Jesus (Hallelujah)
Lord, it was me on Your mind
I've read the words in red
Of a Heavenly home on Earth
You're preparing a place where the sorrow's erased
And when I stand before You, I'll find
All along, it was me on Your mind
Who am I that the King of the world
Would give one single thought about my broken heart?
(My broken heart)
And who am I that the God of all grace
Wipes the tears from my face and says, "Come as you are"?
(Come as you are)
You paid the price, You took the cross
You gave Your life and You did it all
With me on Your mind (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
With me on Your mind (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
Woah (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
It was me on Your mind
