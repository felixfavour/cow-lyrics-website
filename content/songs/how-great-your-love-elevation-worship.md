Oh the cross of Christ
Where love came for us
You pursued our hearts, you pursued us
In the Son of God
The perfect sacrifice
There's rescue for our hearts, rescue for us
Pre-Chorus:
We will lift our voice for all you've done
All you've done for us
Chorus:
Woah, how great your love for us
Glory to our God
You have brought us home
You forgave our hearts
You forgave us
Pre-Chorus
Chorus
Bridge:
We are loved, we are loved
Hallelujah our shame is gone
We are loved, we are loved
Hallelujah, love has won
