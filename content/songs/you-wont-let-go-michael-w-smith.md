No shadow comes without the light making a way
No raging storm can ever defy one word of faith
My heart remains sure in the wind, sure in the waves
You are the anchor for my soul
You won't let go, You won't let go
No matter what may come, I know
You won't let go
[Refrain]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
No valley low changes the truth, so I'm not afraid
You hold me close; You lead me through, light up the way
You are the anchor for my soul
You won't let go, You won't let go
No matter what may come, I know
You won't let go
You won't let go
