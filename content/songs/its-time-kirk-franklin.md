[Intro]
We're so glad You joined us
We've been waiting for Your presence to arrive all day
We're humbled You're here
We kneel up at Your feet and we refuse to leave the same
(The truth is)
Yokes don't break on their own
Our hands are not that strong
And giving up feels wrong
When You've been waiting for so long (C'mon!)
For destiny and victory to finally collide (Yes!)
There's no sound more sweeter than when God says "It's time"(I get prideful)
Every time I step out, independent, God, I fail!
(You still take me back)
So here we are broken, so glad that You destroyed the veil
(Because of the cross)
Condemnation is all gone
Humbled before Your Throne (Thank You)
You say this is where I belong
That I've been patient for so long (for destiny)
For destiny (whoo!) and victory to finally collide (hey!)
There's no sound more sweeter (more sweeter) than when God says "It's time" (So tell!)
So tell all the voices (the ones in my head) I'm doing just fine
(Tell 'em I'm good)
For this day (THIS day) is the day (THE day!) when God says "It's time" (c'mon)
