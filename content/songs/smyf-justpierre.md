Jesus on the mainline, tell Him what you want
Call Him up, let Him know, yo, this is what is wrong
Said I want a heart of flesh, please remove this heart of stone
That was when He saved my soul, I touched His garment & was whole
Healing bodies with His clothes, walk on water like it's land
So why would you ever doubt that all power's in His hands
Two fish, fives loaves, fed five thousand men
Then He took a dying fool & He made him live again
Holy Spirit came in, when I was doing wrong things
Man, I was my own king, lifting up my own name
Man, I was so lame, now I'm fixed to walk it out
Tell them old church mothers I know what they talking' bout
When they say the blood still works
We didn't love Him, but He loved us first
Breathed life into dirt, when we strayed, He was hurt
Crucified, lift the curse, then He called us His church
Work
[Chorus: JeVo'n]
Show me Your face
I want to see You
I want to see
Your Glory
I want to live
In the secret place
Show me Your face
