Up early in the Morning
When I Hear the birds Singing
It Sounds like Freedom
You been Good to me
Even late in the Evening
When the day is ending
I'll still be Singing
You been Good to me
Oh, oh, oh, Glory Hallelujah,
I came Running
When He set me Free
God's been Good to me
Oh, oh, oh Glory Hallelujah
I was blind but now my Eyes can See
God's been Good to me
Got a Testimony
Your Redemption Story
Go Run and tell it
You've been Good to me
Got a Testimony
Your Redemption Story
Go Run and tell it
He's been Good to me
Oh, oh, oh, Glory Hallelujah,
I came Running
When He set me Free
God's been Good to me
Oh oh oh Glory Hallelujah
I was blind but now my Eyes can See
God's been Good to me
(Ooh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
God's been Good to me) [x2]
