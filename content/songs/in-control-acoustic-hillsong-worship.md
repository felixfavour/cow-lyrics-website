From heaven you can hear
I know you're drawing near, as I worship
I'm held within your love
The wind and waves will come
But I will stay here
I lift my hands to heaven
Hear my heart surrender
I tell my soul again, you are Lord of all
And though the seas are raging
You will speak and tame them
In you I found my rest
You are in control
Through valleys I will trust your spirit is enough
To keep me walking
You guide my every step
Speak love to me again
Lord I need you
I lift my hands to heaven
Here my heart surrender
I tell my soul again, you are Lord of all
And though the seas are raging
You will speak and tame them
In you I found my rest
You are in control
