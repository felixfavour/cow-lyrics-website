VERSE 1:
Everlasting
While Earthly ages fade
In mercy
Our God Your kingdom reigns
CHORUS:
Lord over everything
You are near
All of the universe at Your feet
VERSE 2:
In the Saviour
Injustice brought to right
For Your glory
That Your name be lifted high
CHORUS:
Lord over everything
You are near
All of the universe at Your feet
Lord over everything
You are near
All of the universe at Your feet
BRIDGE:
The lost are found
The blind will see
The lame will walk
The dead will live
And You Are God
Forever You will reign
The lost are found
The blind will see
The lame will walk
The dead will live
And You Are God
Forever You will reign
