My heart is humbled
I've heard You speak
There's no denying
You're calling me
To follow You, Lord
As You lead me to life
And casting aside any fear, any pride
Chorus:
I'll say yes, Lord
I'll say yes
I surrender to Your Word
To the truth that I have heard
I'll say yes, Lord
I'll say yes
I will follow You in faith
And I walk in all Your ways
I'll obey
I'll say yes
Here in Your presence
I am complete
Your spirit is stirring
You're calling me
So I give You my heart
I offer my life
And casting aside any fear, any pride
