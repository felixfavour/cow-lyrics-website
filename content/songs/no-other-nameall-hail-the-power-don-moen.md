No other name but the Name of Jesus
No other name but the Name of the Lord
No other name but the Name of Jesus
Is worthy of glory
And worthy of honor
And worthy of power
And all praise

His name is exalted far above the earth
His name is high above the heavens
His name is exalted far above the earth
Give glory and honor
And praise unto His Name

No other name but the Name of Jesus
No other name but the Name of the Lord
No other name but the Name of Jesus
Is worthy of glory
And worthy of honor
And worthy of power
And all praise

All hail the power of Jesus name, let angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem and crown Him Lord of all
Bring forth the royal diadem and crown Him Lord of all

Jesus, Jesus
