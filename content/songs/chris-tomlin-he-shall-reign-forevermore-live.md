In the bleak mid-winter
All creation groans,
For a world in darkness
Frozen like a stone
Light is breaking, in a stable for a throne
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
Unto us a Child is born
The King of kings and Lord of lords
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
If I were a wise man
I would travel far
If I were a shepherd,
I Would do my part, but poor as
I am I will give to Him my heart
And He shall reign Forevermore, forevermore
And He shall reign Forevermore, forevermore
Unto us a Child is born
The King of kings and Lord of lords
And He shall reign Forevermore, forevermore
Here within a manger lies
The One who made the
Starry skies
This baby born for sacrifice
Christ, the Messiah!
Into our hopes, into our fears
The Savior of the world appears
The promise of eternal years
Christ, the Mesiah!
And He shall reign Forevermore, forevermore
And He shall reign Forevermore, forevermore
And He shall reign Forevermore, forevermore
And He shall reign Forevermore, forevermore
Unto us a Child is born
The King of kings and Lord of lords
And He shall reign Forevermore, forevermore
He shall reign
He shall reign
He shall reign
