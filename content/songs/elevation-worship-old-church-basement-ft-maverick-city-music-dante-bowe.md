I don't see anything wrong with the lights or stages
I even love it when the crowd gets loud singing out God's praises
But every now and then, it can get a little complicated
So I remember when I was in that old church basement, singing
Hallelujah is all I need
When I think of Your goodness and Your love for me
Oh, the joy of my salvation, is coming back to me
It's just an old hallelujah with a new melody
And I'm singing
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah
We got together every Wednesday night, about thirty teenagers
My friend Josh bought a cheap guitar and barÐµly knew how to play it
He wasn't putting on a show, wasn't well known, wasn't trying to bÐµ famous
But we sure touched Heaven in that old church basement
Hallelujah is all I need
When I think of Your goodness and Your love for me
Oh, the joy of my salvation, is coming back to me
It's just an old hallelujah with a new melody
And I'm singing
Oh-oh, (Yeah, yeah) oh-oh
Find me singing
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Great is Thy faithfulness Lord unto me
It's just an old hallelujah with a new melody
And I once was blind but now I can see
It's just an old hallelujah with a new melody
Oh, over the mountains and the sea, Your river runs with love for me
An old hallelujah with a new melody
Shout to the Lord all the earth, let us sing
It's just an old hallelujah with a new melody
Hallelujah is all I need
When I think of Your goodness and Your love for me
Oh, the joy of my salvation, is coming back to me
It's just an old hallelujah with a new melody
It's just an old hallelujah with a new melody
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
New melody
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Halle, halle
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Halle, halle (Sing it your way)
Halle, halle (Sing His glory)
Halle, halle
(It's what the Heavens are declaring)
(It's what the Heavens are declaring)
Halle, halle
(So we will respond, we will respond)
(Say Halle) Halle, halle
(Worthy, worthy, worthy)
(Worthy, worthy, worthy)
Halle, halle
(No greater name, no greater name, no greater name)
(Sing Halle) Halle, halle
(Sing it your way, sing it your way)
Halle, halle
(Sing it your way, sing it your way, sing it your way)
(Sing halle, halle) Halle, halle
([Heaven when we praise?]) Halle, halle
([Heaven when we praise?]) Halle, halle
([Heaven when we praise?]) Halle, halle
[?] Halle, halle
(Worthy is the Lamb) Halle, halle
(To receive glory) Halle, halle
(Power, dominion) Halle, halle
Power
Oh glory hallelujah (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Worthy to receive glory, halle, dominion and power (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And hallelujah is all I need
When I think of Your goodness and Your love for me
Oh, the joy of my salvation, is coming back to me
It's just an old hallelujah with a new melody
It's the same hallelujah that the elders sing
And it's the only hallelujah I will ever need
