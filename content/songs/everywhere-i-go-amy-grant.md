I was wasting time
Oh so sure to find
Somebody
Who'll never go
How could I know? Oh
None I found was true
None could be but you
The only one love divine
My heart, my mind
Are yours
Everywhere I go
I see your face through the crowd
(Everywhere I go)
I hear your voice clear and loud
(Everywhere I go)
You are the light that I see
(Everywhere I go)
You have found me
Where could my heart go?
Where you wouldn't know
To find me
Far, far from here
Still you are near
To me
