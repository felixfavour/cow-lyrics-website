There came a sound from Heaven, like a mighty rushing wind. It filled their hearts with singing, and gave them peace within. The prophet made this promise, His spirit will descend. And from my inner being, a river with no end!

There is a river, that flows from deep within. There is a fountain, that frees my soul from sin. Come to this water; there is a vast supply. There is a river, that never shall run dry. 

There came a thirsty woman, who was drawing from the well. Her life was ruined and wasted, her soul was bound for hell. But then she met the Master, who told of her great sign, He said if you drink this water, You'll never thirst again. 

There is a river, that flows from deep within. There is a fountain, that frees my soul from sin. Come to this water; there is a vast supply. There is a river, that never shall run dry.
