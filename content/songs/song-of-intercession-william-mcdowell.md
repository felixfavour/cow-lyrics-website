[Sung:]
Oh Lord... we come...
To You... we lay our lives before You
You know... our needs... before... we asked
So we come... not for ourselves...
But we're crying out for the nations
Oh Lord... we pray...
Give us beauty for ashes
Strength for our weakness
Oh Lord... we pray...
Give us faith to believe
Hearts that we seek
Oh Lord... we pray...
As Your church, we arise
Jesus, please hear our cry and have mercy...
[Spoken:]
Do I have a room full of intercessors tonight
Who will begin to lift up your voice?
Some of you may even want to run to the altar
And begin to lift up your voice
Not on behalf of yourself
But on behalf of the nations
