Hear the clock strike two a.m
Another sleepless night for you
Oh, I have been there too
But there is healing in the hand of God
He will cover everybody
He'll even touch someone like you
It's a natural thing to believe that
Something wonderful never comes easy
Let it go
There is power in the cross to heal us
There is freedom in the blood that Jesus offered to you
So freely
(Chorus)
Feel the wonder of it all
Let your heart and your mind receive
An answer to the call
Feel the wonder of it all
Sweet Jesus
The love of God - the wonder of it all
Another day another twist in the road
A cloud upon your soul
Don't let it take control
Don't be afraid to say the name
He's there for those who call him
He's your refuge from the cold
