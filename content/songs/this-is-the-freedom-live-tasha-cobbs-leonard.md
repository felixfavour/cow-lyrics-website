[Intro]
Now y'all gotta move on this one
Yeah
Where my dreamers at?
Y'all ready to step?
Here we go
(Step into the joy of the Lord) Step into the joy of the Lord
(Step into the joy of the Lord) Step into the joy of the Lord
(Step into the joy of the Lord) Step into the joy of the Lord
(Step into the joy of the Lord) Step into the joy of the Lord
(Step into the joy of the Lord) Step into the joy of the Lord
(Step into the joy of the Lord) Step into the joy of the Lord
(Somebody say step into the joy) Step into the joy of the Lord
(Step into the joy of the Lord) Step into the joy of the Lord
(My heart's been thirsty) My heart's been thirsty
(Yeah) And hungry for more
(My soul's been waiting) My soul's been waiting for You to restore me
(I've got real joy) I've got real joy now, yes, it's real joy
And it's greater than I imagined
My heart's been thirsty and hungry for more
(My soul's been waiting) My soul's been waiting for You (Yeah) to restore me
(I've got real joy) I've got real joy now, yes, it's real joy
And it's greater than I imagined
