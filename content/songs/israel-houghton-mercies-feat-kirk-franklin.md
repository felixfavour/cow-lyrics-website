Nobody said things would always be easy,
Nobody said it would always be nice,
Nobody said that everyday would turn out perfectly right,
Somebody said My yoke is easy,
Somebody said My burden is light
Somebody said that weeping only lasts for just a night,
So when your day comes to an end,
And your night is closing in,
Tears fall uncontrollably,
But you're gonna see...
OH OH OH YOUR HELP IS ON THE WAY,
YOU GOTTA KNOW, TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY
HIS MERCIES ARE FRESH EVERY MORNING!
(Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh)
Nobody said there would always be sunshine,
Nobody said there would never be rain,
Nobody said that you would never have just one of those days,
Somebody said that I'll be your lifeline,
Somebody said I'll take all your pain,
Somebody said that I specialize in impossible things,
When there's darkness all around,
And you feel like breakin' down,
Tears fall uncontrollably,
But you're gonna see......
OH OH OH YOUR HELP IS ON THE WAY,
YOU GOTTA KNOW, TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY
HIS MERCIES ARE FRESH!
OH OH OH YOUR HELP IS ON THE WAY,
YOU GOTTA KNOW, TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY
HIS MERCIES ARE FRESH EVERY MORNING!
Every morning, Grace is dawning,
Sun is rising, favor fallin',
Goodness and mercy will follow you every day,
So don't you worry 'bout a thing, Don't you be afraid,
Everything will be okay, In the mornin'
So don't you worry 'bout a thing, Don't you be afraid
Everything will be okay, In the mornin',
So don't you worry 'bout a thing, Don't you be afraid
Everything will be okay, In the mornin',
So don't you worry 'bout a thing, Don't you be afraid
Everything will be okay, In the mornin'
So don't you worry 'bout a thing, Don't you be afraid
Everything will be okay, In the mornin'
So don't you worry 'bout a thing, Don't you be afraid
Everything will be okay, In the mornin'
So don't you worry 'bout a thing, Don't you be afraid
Everything will be okay, In the mornin'
So don't you worry 'bout a thing, Don't you be afraid
Everything will be okay
His blessings are fresh every morning!!
