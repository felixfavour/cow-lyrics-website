We are a sea of voices
We are an ocean of your praise
Gathered under one name
We are a tide that's rising
And we cannot be contained
Gathered under one name
O for a thousand tongues to sing
The glories of our Lord, God Almighty
O to sing the Saviour's praise
The triumph of His grace
You are worthy
You are worthy God
We have found our anthem
At the cross where sin was slain
Gathered under one name
Where every chain is broken
Every sorrow swept away
Gathered under one name
O for a thousand tongues to sing
The glories of our Lord, God Almighty
O to sing the Saviour's praise
The triumph of His grace
You are worthy
You are worthy God
