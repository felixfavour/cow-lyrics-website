I've been shut down
Silenced for long
I've been crushed and disappointed through life
Not my doing ,flesh had power 
Then you came 
In the brightness of Light 

And power of sin and death 
Is broken over me 
Through the power that's at work in me 
In Jesus name 

I'm Awaken, yes I'm Alive 
Death is silent, fear is gone 
Since I have found Jesus, there shall be light 
I'm Awaken, I Arise..
Ji Masun

Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh
Ji Masun
