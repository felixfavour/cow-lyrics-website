Tell me are you feelin'
The heaviness I'm feelin'
'Cause the space between the word I read
And the world I see feels crazy
Are we being honest
'Cause if I'm being honest
I preach the news More than gospel truth
And I don't think twice about it
Maybe there's a bigger picture
We've been missing
Something different
Ain't talkin' 'bout a Sunday only Actin' holy
Easy kinda faith
Ain't talkin 'bout a barely going
Through the motions
Empty kinda praise
I'm talking 'bout a heart that looks like Jesus
Like His hands, like His feet
There's one Way one Truth one Life that sets us free
That's what we need
Oh, that's what we need
Faith to move the mountains
It ain't about the mountains
It's when the least of these
And the neighbor sees
That we genuinely love them
Maybe there's a bigger purpose
We've been given
Something different
Ain't talkin' 'bout a Sunday only Actin' holy
Easy kinda faith
Ain't talkin 'bout a barely going
Through the motions
Empty kinda praise
I'm talking 'bout a heart that looks like Jesus
Like His hands, like His feet
There's one Way one Truth one Life that sets us free
That's what we need
Oh, that's what we need
We need shelter for the orphan
Healing for the broken
Mercy and compassion
We need it
We need grace to be our banner
Love to be the standard
The only thing that matters
We need it
Ain't talkin' 'bout a Sunday only Actin' holy
Easy kinda faith
Ain't talkin 'bout a barely going
Through the motions
Empty kinda praise
I'm talking 'bout a heart that looks like Jesus
Like His hands, like His feet
There's one Way one Truth one Life that sets us free
That's what we need
We need it
We need it
That's what we need
We need it
We need it
That's what we need
That's what we need
That's what we need
We need it
That's what we need
