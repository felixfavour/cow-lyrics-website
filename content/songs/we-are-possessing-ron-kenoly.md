We are possessing
We are taking back what's ours
We are possessing
We are marching in the power of His might
We are not maintaining
And we will not compromise
We are marching into the battle
Where only the strong survive
We must be strong and courageous
We have got to stand
We are marching into the battle
With a two-edged sword in our hand
The promise that God gave to Joshua
Is ours today
Every piece of ground that our feet shall walk on
That ground is ours to take
We are not maintaining
And we will not not compromise
We are marching into the battle
Where only the strong survive
