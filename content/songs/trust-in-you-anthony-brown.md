You did not create me to worry
You did not create me to fear
But You created me to worship daily
So Ima leave it all right here

My hands are raised because I surrender
Your will is what's best for me
I worship You because
You're Jehovah Jireh
I bow before the King of Kings

No more crying no more complaining
I believe Your word is true
Lord You promised never
to leave me lonely
So this is what I'm going to do

I will trust in You Lord
I will trust in You Lord
I will put my trust in You
