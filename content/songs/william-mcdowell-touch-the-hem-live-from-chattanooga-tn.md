When hope is lost
And you find yourself broken
When you can't see your way
And your prayers are unspoken
You can run to Jesus
Reach out for Him
He knows what you need
If you'd only
Touch the hem of His garment
Just touch the hem of His garment, you'll be made whole (oh oh)
Yes you'll be made whole
(Oh whole again, made new yeah yeah)
When you find it hard to see
And all of the faith you have is weak
When all you have is one last breath
Jesus says, reach out to me
You can run to Jesus,  reach out for Him
He knows what you need
In His Presence, Faith brings Healing
He is all you need
If you only
Touch the hem of His garment(oh reach out and touch)
Touch the hem of His garment, You'll be made whole
Yes You'll be made whole
Touch the hem of His garment
Touch the hem of His garment, You'll be made whole
Yes you'll be whole
(At the feet of our saviour, all you need, it's here, it's here, He is here, So He's here oh oh oh oh)
There's healing,  and there's freedom
New Life at the feet of Jesus
There's healing,  there's freedom
New Life at the feet of Jesus
There's healing, there's freedom
New Life at the feet of Jesus
There's healing,  there's freedom
New Life at the feet of Jesus
(if you'd only)
Touch the hem of His garment
Touch the hem of His garment, You'll be made whole
Yes you'll be made whole
Touch the hem of His garment
Touch the hem of His garment, you'll be made whole
Oh oh oh
Yes you'll be made whole
There's healing there's freedom
New Life at the feet of Jesus
There's healing there's freedom
New Life at the feet of Jesus
There's healing there's freedom
New Life at the feet of Jesus
There is Healing there's Freedom
New Life at the feet of Jesus
(If you'd only yeah)
Touch the hem of His garment
Touch the hem of His garment you'll be made whole
Oh oh oh
Yes you'll be made whole
Yes you'll be made whole
