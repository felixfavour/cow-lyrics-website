I feel You so close to me
I can hardly move or breathe
I can feel Your presence all around
I fall knees down to the ground
[Chorus: Michael W. Smith]
You're the one that really matters
You're the one that really matters
You're the one that really matters
You're the one that really matters
I know that I have been found
The cares of life can't hold me down
'Cause You're the one I want to please
What matters now is what You think
[Chorus: Michael W. Smith & Kari Jobe]
You're the one that really matters
You're the one that really matters
You're the one that really matters
You're the one that really matters
I know that I have been found
The cares of life can't hold me down
'Cause You're the one I want to please
What matters now is what You think
