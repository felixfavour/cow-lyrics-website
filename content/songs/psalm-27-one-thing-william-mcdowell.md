One thing that I've desired of You and that will I seek after
That I may dwell in the house of the Lord forever [repeat]
In the courts of the Lord I find strength that I need
In that place I receive visions and dreams
Mercy and grace everything that I need
I find protection, direction, inspiration, motivation, revelation everything that I need
Patience, mercy, restoration, preservation, breakthrough everything that I need
Blessing, favor, provision, salvation, healing, everything that I need
Comfort, deliverance, safety, covering, shelter, everything that I need
Peace, love, joy, strength, power everything that I need
Answers, guidance, wisdom or counsel, understanding everything that I need
Just one day with You is better than a thousand elsewhere and I wanna be with You Lord
