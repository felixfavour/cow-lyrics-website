2 Corinthians 9:8 AMP 
And God is able to make all grace [every favor and earthly blessing] come in abundance to you, so that you may always [under all circumstances, regardless of the need] have complete sufficiency in everything [being completely self-sufficient in Him], and have an abundance for every good work and act of charity.  

  Pray for the faith and the ability to do above all their past giving ðŸ’¸. We also declare that circumstances for their finances to increase have been divinely planned âœ¨.

              2 
â€‹ Philippians 4:13 (NIV): 
"I can do all this through him who gives me strength."

 â€‹Mark 16:17 (NIV): "And these signs will accompany those who believe..."

 We declare that our partners are strengthened ðŸ’ª and are willing to do more for the gospel, and every member of LoveWorld is doing at least a "Rhapsody wonder" and they work wonders.
