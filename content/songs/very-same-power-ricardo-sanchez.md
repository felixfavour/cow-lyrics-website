Jesus, Jesus my redeemer
There's no greater love than what You've given me
Hallelujah! I'm forgiven
And I'll never be chained again
Because the very same power that raised Christ from the dead
Is alive in me
And the very same power that overcame the grave
It lives in me
And now I am complete since He rescued me, since He rescued me
I'm gonna shout it out loud
Jesus, Jesus my redeemer
There's no greater love than what You've given me
Hallelujah! I'm forgiven
And I'll never be chained again
Because the very same power that raised Christ from the dead
Is alive in me
And the very same power that overcame the grave
It lives in me
Because the very same power that raised Christ from the dead
Is alive in me
And the very same power that overcame the grave
It lives in me
And now I am complete since He rescued me, since He rescued me
I'm gonna shout it out loud
