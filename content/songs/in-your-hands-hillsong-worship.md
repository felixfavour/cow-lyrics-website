I'm so secure
You're here with me
You stay the same
Your love remains here in my heart
So close I believe
You're holding me now
In Your hands I belong
You'll never let me go
So close I believe
You're holding me now
In Your hands I belong
You'll never let me go
You gave your life in Your endless love
You set me free and showed the way
Now I am found
So close I believe
You're holding me now
In Your hands I belong
You'll never let me go
So close I believe
You're holding me now
In Your hands I belong
You'll never let me go
