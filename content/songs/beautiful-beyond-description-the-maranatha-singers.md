You are beautiful beyond description
More wonderful than any other I can see
You alone deserve my deep devotion
And to you alone I bow on bended knee
Victorious in battle you have rescued me
So with all my heart I lift my voice and sing...
You are beautiful beyond description
And forever I will worship you as king
You are beautiful beyond description
More wonderful than any other I can see
You alone deserve my deep devotion
And to you alone I bow on bended knee
Victorious in battle you have rescued me
So with all my heart I lift my voice and sing...
You are beautiful beyond description
And forever I will worship you as king
