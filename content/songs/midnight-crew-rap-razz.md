Wa gbo instrumental yi o
Wa gbo instrumental se o ti gbo
Wa gbo instrumental yi o
Wa gbo instrumental so ti gbo
Give me a minute ama jump into it
I came through you know how we do it
New trying music, we tryna pursue it
At the end of this they ask how we do it
Put your hand up in the air,
Me na groove up the air
With the roof top Mcs and we here to party
You can dance in the air, Jumpout of the chair
Let the whole world prepare for the record of the year
Ai ri jina la ri abuke okere
Ti o ba ni idi owala on je chinyere
Weere ni gbogbo ise oluwa
Ti o ba ti e ni gist, ma lo fara wey wa
You wanna hear,
Stop what you doing and get over here
You gat nothing to fear
Said you go here
Wa gbo instrumental yi o jo jo
Wa gbo instrumental se o ti gbo ,omo ma da mi leere
Wa gbo instrumental yi o ti la pala po ta po te
Wa gbo instrumental so ti gbo

This is a dance track so don't get it twisted
I love the way you step,
But I need it, its been on my mind
I think about you all the time
Being down in this line get up and shine
Its time baby get on the show
Its never to late lets rock the boat
Let me blow you away like the pai pai
I can take it easy I can strike like a vibe
Okay slow down let me start from the beginning
I didnt chose to rep, rep chose me
So I make the track so don't impose me
I know it sounds familiar but am serious
Been down in the low, I can speak you up
God bless the Mic and pay attention
Na Midnight I stay on the roof top
Holla at us I show it to the world
