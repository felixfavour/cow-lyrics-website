The name of Jesus is the only name given in heaven
And on earth
Jesus Christ attained His name and openly defeated the Devil
When He went down into hell
He forced out of the Devil's hands
The key to death and hell
And He came out and He said
All power is given to Me
In heaven and on earth
Go in My name
For in My name there is salvation
In My name there is healing
In My name there is deliverance
In My name there is peace
Cos I am the Prince of peace
And I live and reign forever
(You are the Lord of lords) Jesus
(You are the King of kings) Jesus
(You are the Alpha and Omega) Jesus
(And You are the coming king) Jesus
(You are the Lord of lords) Jesus
