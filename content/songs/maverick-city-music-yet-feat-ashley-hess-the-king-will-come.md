God don't give up on me yet
I know am not your best bet
but am trying don't give up on me yet
oh oooo yea
God don't leave me here alone
I know I need to grow still
but am trying don't leave me here alone
uh I know i av come so far but i got
 so far to go
And with these brand-new scars
And this broken heart
It's hard to really know
If there's a reason
And if I'll ever see it
But I wanna believe it
So don't give up on me yet
please.....
God I know it makes no sense
you love me time and time again
but I still need reminding
I know it makes no sense
l know I come so far but I got so far to go ( got so far to go)
And with these brand-new scars
And this broken heart ( broken heart)
It's hard to really know
If there's a reason
And if I'll ever see it
But I wanna believe it ( please )
So don't give up on me yet (please God)
(Oh) Don't give up on me
please
Don't give up on me (Ooh)
please
his grace will never run out
there is enough to go round and round
left in ocean were your shame is drown
if know what he know them you know( 3x)
you won't give up on him
God i know am not the same
but you know I will change and I think that  you trying to tell me is ok
I know I've come so far
But got so far to go
And with these brand-new scars
And this broken heart
It's hard to really know
If there's a reason
And if I'll ever see it
But I wanna believe it
So don't give up on me yet
Don't give up on me yet
