Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks up dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and the mistletoe
Oh, they help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeers really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To all of you kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids. all you kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, so many ways
Merry Christmas
Merry Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas to
Merry Christmas to you
