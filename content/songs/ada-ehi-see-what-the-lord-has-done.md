See oh see what the lord has done 4ce
More than I asked for
More than my mouth can say
See oh see
The king of glory became my portion
Oh see oh see
He gave me a new song
So everybody who hears will say
See oh see what the lord has done
See oh see what the lord has done 4ce
More than I asked for
More than my mouth can say
See oh see
The king of glory became my portion
Oh see oh see
He gave me a new song
So everybody who hears will say
See oh see what the lord has done
No eyes have seen
No ears have heard
I can't describe
What the lord has in store for me
Something new
His glory is risen
It has come to pass
And my eyes have seen it oh oh
What the lord has in store for me
Shout oh shout for the lord is good
Shout oh shout for the lord is good
More than I asked for
More than my mouth can say
See oh see
The king of glory became my portion
Oh see oh see
He gave me a new song
So everybody who hears will say
Oh More than I asked for
More than my mouth can say
See oh see
The king of glory became my portion
Oh see oh see
He gave me a new song
So everybody who hears will say
See oh see what the lord has done
See oh see what the lord has done
