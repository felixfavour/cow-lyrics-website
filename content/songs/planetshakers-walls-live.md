I'm Facing Challenges
But they won't Break me
They're gonna make me
Because You Hold me
I walk through Valleys but they
But they don't scare me
Because You're with me
I've got my mind made up
That I will turn this place
Into a place of Praise
And As I do I know
You'll bring about the change

This is an Offering
This is a Sacrifice of Praise
I give You everything
Building an altar to Your name
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Right here, right now
This is where Praise Breaks out
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Right here, right now
This is where the Walls
This is where the Walls come down
I'm not Intimidated
By what I'm Facing
I got my Faith set
On who I'm Praising
There is a Victory, I'm Anticipating
The walls are Breaking
We'll take the Promised Land
And I will turn this place
Into a place of Praise
As I do I know
You'll bring about the change

This is an Offering
This is a Sacrifice of Praise
(we give you everything)
I give You everything
Building an altar to Your name
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Right here, right now
This is where Praise Breaks out
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Right here, right now
This is where the Walls
This is where the Walls come down
[Bridge]
Cause You're here
Everything is Changing
Cause You're here
Every Chain is Breaking
I can be Fearless
Cause You are here with me
Cause You're here
I live in Freedom
Cause You're here
Lord I believe that
I can be Fearless
Cause You are here with me
Right here, right now
This is where Praise breaks out
oh oh oh oh oh
Right here, right now
This is where the Walls
This is where the Walls come down
(let's go)
Cause You're here
Everything is Changing
Cause You're here
Every Chain is Breaking
Cause You're here
I live in Freedom
Cause You're here
Lord I believe that
I can be Fearless
Cause You are here with me
I can be fearless
Cause You are here with me
