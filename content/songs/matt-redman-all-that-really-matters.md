t our lives become a song for You
Like a prayer that reaches high
The glory of Your name our greatest cause
Let our lives become an offering
Ever pleasing to Your heart
The glory of Your name our highest call
All that really matters
All that really counts is found in You
What else would we live for?
You're the Way, the Life, the Truth
And all that really matters is You
Let our lives become a light for You
Like a city on a hill
We'll glorify Your name forevermore, Lord
All that really matters
All that really counts is found in You
What else would we live for?
You're the Way, the Life, the Truth
And all that really matters is You
King of glory, be the center
King of glory, You'll be the prize
We shall have no other treasure
All that counts is You lifted high
King of glory, be the center
King of glory, You'll be the prize
We shall have no other treasure
All that counts is You lifted high
All that really matters
All that really counts is found in You
What else would we live for?
You're the Way, the Life, the Truth
And all that really matters is You
All that really counts is found in You
What else would we live for?
You're the Way, the Life, the Truth
All that matters, all that really matters is You
All that matters, all that really matters is You
All that matters, all that really matters is You
All that matters, all that really matters is You
All that matters, all that really matters is You
