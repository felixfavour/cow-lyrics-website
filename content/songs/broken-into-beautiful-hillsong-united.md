1 She's smiling on the outside
But she's hurting on the inside
It's getting hard just leaving anymore
And the shadow she has clung to
Painful things she has been thru
Have left her feelings worthless low
If you change worthless into precious
CHORUS:
Guilty to forgiven
Hungry into satisfied
Empty into full
And all their lives are shattered
And we believe matter
When you change broken into beautiful
2 We live with accusation
Sometimes heavy expectations
That tеll us that we can never mеasure of
Yet you repeat with mercy
Than in your eyes we are worthy
And at last we've seen how much we are loved
Coz you change worthless into precious
