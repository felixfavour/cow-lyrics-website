Even though it is so hard to move on
Everybody around me couldn't help
Though they promised but they will not meet up.
Because even them, they have their own secret pains

I've been long gone, trusting in man
Though they tried but they fail
But I'm encouraged; no hope is lost
I will tell you why

I've a father that will never ever fail me
I've a father. He will never ever fail me
Jehova baba, he will never ever fail me
Rock of Ages never ever fails

I've a father that will never ever fail me
I've a father. He will never ever fail me
Jehova baba, he will never ever fail me
Rock of Ages never ever fails
