God of all ages
King of all kingdoms
The omnipotent

The apex of wisdom
The works of Your hands
Are ineffable

You are holy and great
Righteous and glorious
You are the source of life

You are faithful and good
Fearful in praises
You are the strength of our lives

Hallelujah, blessed be Your name
Hallelujah, to Your majesty

Oh Lord, You are the song that we sing
And our melody
Is designed to give You praise

Glory to You, Lord
You created us for Your good pleasure
Every word that we speak, glorifies You

You are God over all we do
Glory to you, Lord
We are grateful


Giver of life, Self-existent
Son of God exalted

Boundless King, Ancient of days
You’re so powerful

You are holy and great
Righteous and glorious
You are the source of life

You are faithful and good
Fearful in praises
You are the strength of our lives

Hallelujah, blessed be Your name
Hallelujah, to Your majesty

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
You’re the great and mighty God
Our strong tower, our strengthener

You’re the King who sits on the throne
You’re the wisest
You are the greatest

The greatest

Glory to You Lord, we are grateful
Glory to You Lord, we are grateful
