[Chorus]
Oh clap your hands
All ye people
And shout unto God
With a voice of triumph
Whoa-ooh-oh
With a voice of triumph
Whoa-ooh-oh
You are the everlasting God
Shine your light to us
For all the world to see
You are the hope of broken hearts
Overcame the grave
To save humanity
[Pre-Chorus]
Sing it!
Hallelujah
Jesus is alive
Oh clap your hands
All ye people
And shout unto God
Oh clap your hands
All ye people
And shout unto God
With a voice of triumph
Whoa-ooh-oh
With a voice of triumph
Whoa-ooh-oh
