[Intro]
(Rum, pa-rum, rum, pa-rum, rum, pa-rum)
(Rum, pa-rum, rum)
Come, they told me, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
A newborn King to see, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
And to lay before the King, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
Rum, pum-pum, pum, rum, pum-pum, pum
[Hook]
So to honor Him, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
When we come (Rum, pa-rum)
(Rum, pa-rum, rum, pa-rum)
(Rum, pa-rum, rum)
Little Baby, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
And I am a poor boy, too, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
And I have no gift to bring, pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
And that's fit to give the King
Pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
Rum, pum-pum, pum, rum, pum-pum, pum
[Hook]
Shall I play for Him? Pa-rum, pum-pum, pum
On my drum!
(Pa-rum)
And on my drum!
