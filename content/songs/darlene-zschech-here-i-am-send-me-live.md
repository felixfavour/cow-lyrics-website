Ev'ry knee; will bow
Ev'ry tongue, confess
Ev'ry heart; will cry out Your Name
You are welcome, You're welcome
Ev'ry life, will see
The glory of our King
Jesus come; and reign in our hearts
You are welcome, You're welcome
Holy Spirit come; come in power
My life is Yours, my life is Yours
Holy Spirit come; start a fire
My life is Yours, my life is Yours!
God of heav'n and earth
We long for more of You
Come and meet; with us as we pray
You are welcome, You're welcome
Holy Spirit come; come in power
My life is Yours, my life is Yours
Holy Spirit come; start a fire
My life is Yours, my life is Yours!
Here I am; send me
Here I am; send me
Here I am; send me, God!
Here I am; send me
Here I am; send me
Here I am; send me, God!
Holy Spirit come; come in power
My life is Yours, my life is Yours
Holy Spirit come; start a fire
My life is Yours, my life is Yours
Holy Spirit come; come in power
My life is Yours, my life is Yours
Holy Spirit come; start a fire
My life is Yours, my life is Yours!...
Here I am; send me
Here I am; send me
Here I am; send me, God!
Here I am; send me
Here I am; send me
Here I am; send me, God!
Send me; to the nations
Send me; to my neighbours
Send me; with Your love!
Send me; to the nations
Send me; to my neighbours
Send me; with Your love!
Send me; to the nations
Send me; to my neighbours
Send me; with Your love!
Send me; to the nations
Send me; to my neighbours
Send me; with Your love!
Here I am; send me
Here I am; send me
Here I am; send me, God!
