ohhhhhhhhh
oh yea yea yea yea
I've gone through the fire
And I've been through the flood
I've been broken into pieces
Seen lightening flash from above
But through it all
I remember
That He loves me
And He cares
And will never
Put more on me
Than I can bear
oh yea
I've been through the fire
And I've been through the flood
I've been broken into pieces
Seen lightening flash from above
But through it all
I remember
That He loves me
And He cares
And will never
Put more on me
Than I can bear
No He'll never put more on me
I say never put more on me
Ah ah never put more on me
Never never never never
His word said He won't
I believe it
I receive it
I claim
It's mine....(8x)
No He'll never put more on me
Than I can bear .
Can bear...
Can bear....
Can bear ....
Can bear......
Can bear......
