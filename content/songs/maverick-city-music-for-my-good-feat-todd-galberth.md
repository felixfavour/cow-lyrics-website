(Piano plays)
I used to dread those desert valleys
But now I thank you for those trials
I used to curse the walls around me
but now I see, you had it figured out
and it was all working for my good
if only I knew back then what I know right now
ohhh
nothing is wasted in your ends
God you didn't forsake me n I know you never will
ooohhh
there's beauty in thee ashes
there's a peace within the storm
oohhhh
n there's a song for every season
so don't stop singing
