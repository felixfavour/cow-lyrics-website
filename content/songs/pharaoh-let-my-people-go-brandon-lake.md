I stand before the oppressor
Who wants to keep me in chains
I'll sing, "My God is a God of freedom""Don't underestimate His strength"I hear that boast of the tyrant
Seeing my backs to a wall
He drew his sword thinking it was over
Guess he don't know my God at all
Freedom, freedom
By the power of His mighty hand
Freedom, freedom
Got me runnin' to the promised land
Freedom, freedom
Pharaoh, hear the Lord's command
Freedom, freedom
He walked me right through that Red Sea
Drownin' the army behind
He goes before me with strength and mercy
And He's never lost a single fight, no
Freedom, freedom
By the power of His mighty hand
Freedom, freedom
Got me runnin' to the promised land
Freedom, freedom
Pharaoh, hear the Lord's command
Freedom, freedom
