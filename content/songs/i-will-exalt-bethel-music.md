[Instrumental]
Your presence is all I need
It's all I want, and all I seek
And without it
Without it, there's no meaning
Your presence is the air I breathe
The song I sing, and the love I need
And without it
Without it, I'm not living
[Turn]
Your presence is all I need
It's all I want, and all I seek
Without it
Without it, there's no meaning
Your presence is the air I breathe
The song I sing, and the love I need
And without it
Without it, I'm not living
So I will exalt You, Lord, I will exalt You, Lord
There is no one like You, God
And I will exalt You, Lord, I will exalt You, Lord
No other name be lifted high
