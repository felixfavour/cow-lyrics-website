[Chorus]
I will trust in the Lord
I will trust in the Lord
I will trust in the Lord
'Til I die
I will trust in the Lord
I will trust in the Lord
I'm gonna trust in
I will trust in the Lord
'Til I lay down
Trust your word
You have complete control
I will be satisfied with you
Where you lead I'll go (Come on, give it to 'em)
I will trust your word
You have complete control
I will be satisfied with you
Silver and Gold, none of that matters
Where you lead I'll go
I will trust your word
You have complete control
I will be satisfied with you
