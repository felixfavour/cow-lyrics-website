There is nothing I wouldn't do for you
Cause you take me higher
(yeah higher)
There is nowhere I wouldn't go it's true
Lord take me higher
(Yeah higher)
Give me more of your glory
Yes more of your spirit
God I just need more of you cause...
I want to be lost in your presence
Yes I want to be wrapped in your love
Take me higher
(higher)
Consumed by your glory
Consumed by your glory
Blessed by your story
Amazed at your love
There's healing the for me Lord higher
(higher)
Consumed by your glory
Blessed by your story
Amazed at your love
Cause you'll be there for me Lord higher
(higher)
