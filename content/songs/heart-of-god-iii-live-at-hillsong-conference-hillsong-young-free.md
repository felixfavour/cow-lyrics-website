Here I stand before You now
As honestly as I know how
Broken by the days gone by
Spirit help my soul to rise
I try my best but still, I fail
And even then You're with me there
You remind me I’m a child of God
Regardless of the things I've done
Oh my hope is found in perfect love
[Chorus: Aodhan King]
Your mercy triumphs over judgment
Love wider than horizons
Stronger than all sin
Lord Your kindness
Leads us to repentance
And to the heart of God
Your heart oh God
Is all I want
Oh, they say that it's impossible
To ever save a sinner’s soul
But my God says to the prodigal
"My beloved one
You're welcome home", ooh
