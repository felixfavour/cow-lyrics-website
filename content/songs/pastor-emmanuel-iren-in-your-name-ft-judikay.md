In your name Every sickness has a cure
in your name Every devil flees the door
In your name we will always overcome
In the mighty name of Jesus......
oh oh oh oh
in your name we always win
In your name we have the victory
in your name we will never be defeated
in the mighty name of Jesus
for with God
nothing shall be impossible
it doesn't matter what the doctor says
every sickness has a cure
wherefore God has highly exalted Jesus and given Him a name above every other name
that at the name of Jesus
every knee should bow
and every tongue should confess that Jesus is Lord to the Glory of God the Father
let Hope rise in your heart
let faith rise in your heart
it's not over
rise up and he healed!!
in Jesus name I receive favour
in Jesus name I receive greatness
in Jesus name In Jesus name
