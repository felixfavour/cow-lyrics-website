*lyrics and ad-libs not final
You bring life to the barren places
Light to the darkest spaces
God, it's Your nature
You bring joy to the broken hearted
Hope to the ones who've lost it
God, it's Your nature
There is no desert that Your streams can't run to
There are no ruins that Your love won't make new
You tell the wasteland that it will bloom again
'Cause it's Your nature
You will restore the years that shame has stolen
You keep the promises that You have spoken
I know this wasteland will be whole again
'Cause it's Your nature
You bring peace to the war inside us
Speak and all fear is silenced
God, it's Your nature
You bring joy to the broken hearted
Hope to the ones who've lost it
God, it's Your nature
