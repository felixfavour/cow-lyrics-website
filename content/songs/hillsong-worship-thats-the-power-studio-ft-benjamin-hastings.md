Verse 1
There's a Name that levels mountains
Carves out highways through the sea
I've seen its power unravel battles
Right in front of me
There's a faith that stands defiant
Sends Goliath to his knees
I've seen as praise unravelled shackles
Right off my feet
Chorus 1
That's the power of Your Name
Just a mention makes a way
Giants fall and strongholds break
That's the power that I claim
It's the same that rolled the grave
There's no power like the
Mighty Name of Jesus
Verse 2
There's a hope that calls out courage
In the furnace unafraid
The kind of daring expectation
That every prayer I make
Is on an empty grave
Tag 1
There's no power like the mighty Name of Jesus
Bridge 1
I see You taking ground, I see You press ahead
Your power is dangerous to the enemy's camp
You still do miracles, You will do what You said
For You're the same God now as You've always been
Bridge 2
Your Spirit breaking out, Your kingdom moving in
Your victory claims the ground that the enemy had
You still do miracles, You will do what You said
For You're the same God now as
You've always been
Chorus 2
That's the power of Your Name
Just a mention makes a way
Giants fall and strongholds break
And there is healing
That's the power that I claim
It's the same that rolled the grave
There's no power like the
Mighty Name of Jesus
Tag 2
There's no power like the mighty Name of Jesus
