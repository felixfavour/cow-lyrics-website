Found love beyond all reason
You gave Your life, Your all for me
And called me Yours forever
Caught in the mercy fallout
I found hope, found life
Found all I need
Cause You're all I need
[Pre-Chorus]
The time has come
To stand for all we believe in
So I, for one, am gonna
Give my praise to You
Today, today, it's all or nothing
All they way, the praise goes out to You
Yeah, all the praise goes out to You
Today, today, I live for one thing
To give You praise in everything I do
Yeah, all the praise goes out to You
