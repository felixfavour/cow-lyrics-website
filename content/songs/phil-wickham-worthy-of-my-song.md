II'm gonna sing 'til my heart starts changing
Oh, I'm gonna worship 'til I mean every word
'Cause the way I feel and the fear I'm facing
Doesn't change who You are or what You deserve
I give You my worship
You still deserve it
You're worthy, You're worthy
You're worthy of my song
I'll pour out Your praises
In blessing and breaking
You're worthy, You're worthy
You're worthy of my song
Yes You are, yes You are, Jesus
You're worthy
I'm gonna live like my King is risen
Gonna preach to my soul that You've already won
And even though I can't see it, I'm gonna keep believing
That every promise You make is as good as done
I give You my worship
You still deserve it
You're worthy, You're worthy
You're worthy of my song
I'll pour out Your praises
In blessing and breaking
You're worthy, You're worthy
Jesus, You're worthy of my song
You're worthy, You're worthy
Jesus, You're worthy of my song
You're worthy, oh, You're worthy
When I sat by that hospital bed, You were worthy
And she could barely lift her head, You were worthy
After all those tears were shed, You were worthy
I'll never stop singing Your praise
I'll never stop singing Your praise
And in the blessing, in the pain, You are worthy
Whether You say yes or no or wait, You are worthy
Through it all, I choose to say, "You are worthy"
I'll never stop singing Your praise
No, I'll never stop singing Your praise
And when I finally see Your face, I'll cry worthy
And when You wipe these tears away, I'll cry worthy
Above every other name, You are worthy
I'll never stop singing Your praise
No, I'll never stop singing Your praise
I'll never stop singing Your praise
I'll never stop singing Your praise
I give You my worship
'Cause You still deserve it
You're worthy, You're worthy
Jesus, You're worthy of my song
I'll pour out Your praises
In blessing and breaking
You're worthy, You're worthy
Jesus, You're Worthy of my song
You're worthy, You're worthy
Jesus, You're worthy of my song
You're worthy, You're worthy
Forever You're worthy of my song
You're worthy, You're worthy
Jesus, You're worthy of my song
You're worthy, oh, You're worthy
And when I finally see Your face, I'll cry worthy
And when You wipe these tears away, I'll cry worthy
Above every other name, You are worthy
I'll never stop singing, Your praise
No, I'll never stop singing Your praise
I'll never stop singing
I'll never stop singing Your praise
I'll never stop singing Your
