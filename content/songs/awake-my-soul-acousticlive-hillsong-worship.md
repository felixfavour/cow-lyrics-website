There is a sound I love to hear
It's the sound of the Saviour's robe
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear praises, He hears faith
There is a sound I love to hear
It's the sound of the Saviour's robe
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear worship, He hears faith
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
Oh, awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Ooh-ooh
There is a sound that changes things
The sound of His people on their knees
Oh, wake up you slumbering
It's time to worship Him
