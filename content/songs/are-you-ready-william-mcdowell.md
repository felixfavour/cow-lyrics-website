Can you see it
Can you hear it
Hear the voice of the father
Calling us hire to hear
And to see that the earth is in need
Desperate to see a move of God
They are crying out
We are crying out
So we shout aloud
[Chorus:]
We’re Ready!
Ready to see
Blind eyes opened
Bondage Broken
We’re ready
We’re ready to see
Nations healed
Your glory revealed
We’re Ready
We’re ready to see
A move of God
[Rap Lead:]
Let’s Go. Let’s Go
Are you Ready?
Let’s Go. Let’s Go
