I give up I surrender, I throw in the town
Exposing my weakness to infinite power
With all of my weight, I lean heavy on you
With bags on my back, and in both my hands too
I fall, I fall on you
I fall, I fall on you
See my world keeps on spinning, out of control
And I'm dizzy from trying, to stand on my own
But you promised to catch me, if I tumbled down
'Cause the way to the sky, starts low to the ground
And I fall, fall on you
I fall, I fall on you
So please don't move, please don't move, please don't move
From here, from here
Please don't move, please don't move, please don't move
From here, from here
Please don't move, please don't move, please don't move
From here, from here
Please don't move, please don't move, please don't move
From here, from here
