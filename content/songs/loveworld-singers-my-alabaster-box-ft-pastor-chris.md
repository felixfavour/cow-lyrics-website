With tears in her eyes
And gratitude in her heart
She carried her choicest perfume
In an alabaster box
She fell at Jesus feet And poured it on his feet
Sodding with gratitude
With her hair, she wipe his feet
*I am here to say
Thank you
For loving me
For loving someone like me
I am here to say
Thank you
With my alabaster box
As my offering to you *2
Just like that woman
I'm here to thank you Lord
With my hands lifted up
For all you're done for me
And with a grateful heart
My praise offering i bring
I stand before your presence
Oh Lord, I worship you
I am here to say
Thank you
For saving me
For all you're done for me
I lift my voice to say
Thank you
For loving me
For all you're done for me
With my lips filled with praise
Just want to say thank you
With a grateful heart
Just want to say thank you
You filled my life with your glory
And gave me victories
For all you're done for me
I just want to say
