Take this life, forever I will call it Yours
Take this life, You're the One I'm living for (Oh, I'm living for)
I give it all to You
I give it all to You
Love so great it taught my heart to beat again
God, Your praise will ever be upon my lips
[Pre-Chorus]
I give it all to You
I give it all to You, yeah!
Your love is better than life
Better than life, better than life
Your love is better than life
Better than life, better than life
So I give it all, give it all
Give it all, give it all to You
Oh, and I give it all, give it all
Give it all, give it all to You
To You, to You
I give it all to You
