1: Hear the call of the Lamb,
Hear the call of the Lamb,
Jesus commands me to come,
Iâ€™ll follow Jesus to the end.

2: I will do the will of the Father,
I will do the will of the Father,
No matter all the temptations,
will not leave Jesus alone.

3: Brethren, come rejoice with me,
Brethren, come rejoice with me,
Because Jesus answered me,
I will not leave Jesus alone. 
Amen
