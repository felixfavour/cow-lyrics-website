I remember times not long ago
When I was but a child
It seemed the world was brand new then
You made my life worthwhile
Even though years have gone, the time has past
And childhood seasons change
I hear your voice still loud and clear
Saying time and time again
Home is always here for you
Even when you fall
No matter where your heart has been
How far you have gone
You said, let me make it clear
You're still welcomе here
Love is nеver far away
That's why we call it home
Home's still here for you
Home's still here
I remember times not long ago
When you were but a child
To me the world was brand new then
You made my life worthwhile
Years have gone, the time has past
And childhood seasons change
Know my love is here for you
When life rewards you pain
