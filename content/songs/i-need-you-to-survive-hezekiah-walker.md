I need you, you need me
We're all a part of God's body
Stand with me, agree with me
We're all a part of God's body

It is His will,
That every need be supplied
You are important to me, 
I need you to survive
You are important to me,
I need you to survive

I need you, you need me
We're all a part of God's body
Stand with me, Agree with me
We're all a part of God's body

It is his will, that every need be supplied
You are important to me, 
I need you to survive
You are important to me, I need you to survive

(This is beautiful, let’s do it one more time)
(Come on open your mouth and say “I need you”)
