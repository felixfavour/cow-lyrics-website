I will come and bow down
At Your feet, Lord Jesus
In Your presence is fullness of joy
There is nothing, there is no one
Who compares with You
I take pleasure in worshipping You Lord
Yes, I bow down Lord before you
Without hesitation without reservation Lord
Because I love You
And I thank You for Your goodness
And Your mercy and Your love
I bow down before you, Lord
And I don't care who sees me Lord
Because I love You and I am not ashamed
Of the gospel of Jesus Christ
I'm not ashamed of what You've done for me Lord
Heaven is Your Throne
And the earth is Your footstool
Jesus, I come to bow down at Your feet
O how I love just to worship before You
In Your presence my joy is complete
Worship with us right now
I will come and bow down
At Your feet, Lord Jesus
In Your presence is fulness of joy
There is nothing, there is no one
Who compares with You
I take pleasure in worshipping You Lord
There is nothing
There is nothing, there is no one
Who compares with You
I take pleasure (I take pleasure) in worshipping
I take pleasure in worshipping
I take pleasure in worshipping You Lord
There is nothing, there is no one
Who compares with You
It's my pleasure to love You Lord
It's my pleasure to glorify You Lord
It's my pleasure to worship You Lord
