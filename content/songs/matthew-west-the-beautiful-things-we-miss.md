She puts on her makeup
And the last dress she remembers that turned his head
That time he said, "You look beautiful"
At six, the front door opens
And he doesn't even notice
Kisses her cheek
"Baby, when do we eat?
I'm starving"
Oh whoa oh
The beautiful things we miss
I don't wanna miss it
I don't wanna look back someday and find
Everything that really mattered
Was right in front of me this whole time
Open up my eyes, Lord
Keep me in the moment just like this
Before the beautiful things we love
Become the beautiful things we miss
She hides out in her headphones
Texting on her cell phone
Daddy's girl built a world behind her bedroom door
While he was working hard and providing
Bigger houses still get divided
Just yesterday she was on his shoulders, but today she's older
Why do we get older?
Oh whoa oh
The beautiful things we miss
I don't wanna miss it
I don't wanna look back someday and find
Everything that really mattered
Was right in front of me this whole time
Open up my eyes, Lord
Keep me in the moment just like this
Before the beautiful things we love
Become the beautiful things we miss
We don't get to rewind
There's no such thing as next time
Help me remember, help me remember, we don't get this back
They were right when they said don't blink
It all goes faster than you think
Lord, help me remember, help me remember
The beautiful things we miss
I don't wanna miss it
I don't wanna look back someday and find
Everything that really mattered
Was right in front of me this whole time
Open up my eyes, Lord
Keep me in the moment just like this
Before the beautiful things we love
Become the beautiful things we miss
Open up my eyes, Lord
Open up my eyes, Lord
I don't want to miss it
No, I don't want to miss it
Open up my eyes, Lord
Open up my eyes, Lord
Before the beautiful things I love
Become the beautiful things I miss
