Falling on my knees in worship
Giving all I am to seek Your face
Lord, all I am is Yours
My whole life I place in Your hands
God of mercy, humbled, I bow down
In Your presence, at Your throne
I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I wanna be where You are
My whole life I place in Your hands
God of mercy, humbled, I bow down
In Your presence, at Your throne
I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I wanna be where You are
I called, You answered
And You came to my rescue
And I wanna be where You are
