Let it rain - spoken
Looks like tonight the sky is heavy
Feels like the winds are gonna change
Beneath my feet the earth is ready
I know it's time for heaven's rain, it's gonna rain
Yeah, yeah
Cos it's living water we desire
To flood our hearts with holy fire
Rain down, all around the world we're singing?
Rain down, can you hear the earth is singing
Rain down, my heart is dry but still I'm singing
Rain down, rain it down on me
Back to the start, my heart is heavy
Feels like it's time to dream again
I see the clouds and, yes, I'm ready
To dance upon this barren land, hope in my hands
Yeah, yeah
Cos it's living water we desire
To flood our hearts with holy fire
