Unreserved, unrestrained
Your love is wild
Your love is wild for me
It isn't shy, it's unashamed
Your love is proud
To be seen with me
To be seen with me
You don't give Your heart in pieces
You don't hide Yourself to tease us
Uncontrolled, uncontained
Your love is a fire
Burning bright for me
It's not a spark
It's not just a flame
Your love is light
And all the world will see
All the world will see
That You don't give Your heart in pieces
And You don't hide Yourself to tease us, no
You don't give Your heart in pieces, no
And You don't hide Yourself to tease us, no
