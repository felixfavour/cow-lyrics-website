This is my story, this is my song
I have a hope that's stronger than the dust I'm standing on
This is my anchor, my cornerstone
This is the anthem I'll be singing till the kingdom comes
I am committed, I'm not ashamed
I pledge my allegiance to Jesus, my King
I am committed, got nothing to hide
I'm not giving up, not selling out, I'm in this for life
I am committed to Christ
For all that He's given, the price that He paid
For ever we're freed by the power of His unshakable grace
For all of His children, His daughters and sons
This is the anthem we'll keep singing from the top of our lungs
I am committed, I'm not ashamed
I pledge my allegiance to Jesus, my King
I am committed, got nothing to hide
I'm not giving up, not selling out, I'm in this for life
I am committed
To the One who gave it all
To the One who fights for us
To the One who took my suffering
In the name of love
This is our message, our battle cry
So stand up and sing with me
I am committed, I'm not ashamed
I pledge my allegiance to Jesus, my King
I am committed, got nothing to hide (nothing to hide)
I'm not giving up, not selling out, I'm in this for life (Oh, all of my life)
I am committed to Christ
(This is my story)
I am committed to Christ
(And it's my song)
I am committed to Christ
