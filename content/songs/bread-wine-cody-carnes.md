You're the bread and wine
The single source of life
Only You satisfy
My everything
The well that won't run dry
The ever-rising tide
One drop and I'm revived
My everything
All I need, all I need
All I need is You, is You
The table's open now
We belong, we're found
You gave us Heaven's crown
Of glory, of glory
All I need, all I need
All I need is You, is You
