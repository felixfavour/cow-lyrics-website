Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. I can feel His mighty power and His grace. 

I can hear the brush of angel’s wings. I see glory on each face. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place.

In the midst of His children the Lord said He would be. 
It doesn’t take very many
It can be just two or three. 
And I feel that same sweet 

spirit that I’ve felt so many times before. 
Surely I can say I’ve been with the Lord. 

Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. I can feel His mighty power and His grace. 

I can hear the brush of angel’s wings. I see glory on each face. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place.

There’s a holy hush around us as His glory fills this place
I’ve touched the hem of His garment. 

I can almost see His face
And my heart is overflowing with the fullness of His joy
I know without a doubt That I’ve been with the Lord

Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place. I can feel His mighty power and His grace. 

I can hear the brush of angel’s wings. I see glory on each face. Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place.
