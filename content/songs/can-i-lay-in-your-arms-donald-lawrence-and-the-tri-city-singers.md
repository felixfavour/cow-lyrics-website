Can I lay in Your arms
Keep me from all harm
Breathe on me, breathe on me
I find safety in Your arms
Can I lay in Your arms
Keep me from all harm
Breathe on me, breathe on me
I find safety in Your arms
Oh, God my passion's for You
No one can love me like You do
Breathe on me, breathe on me
I find safety in Your arms
Oh, God my passion's for You
No one can love me like You do
Breathe on me, breathe on me
I find safety in Your arms
Can I lay in Your arms
(Lord, I need You to keep me from all harm)
Can I lay in Your arms
(Can I lay, can I lay)
Can I lay in Your arms
(Keep me from all harm)
Can I lay in Your arms
(Can I lay in, can I lay in, can I lay in Your arms)
