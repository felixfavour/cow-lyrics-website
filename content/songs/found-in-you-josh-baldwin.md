Whatever is left of me
After my strength has faded
When I don't have words to speak
I'll just say Your name
Whatever is left of me
After the night has ended
When I don't have songs to sing
I'll just call Your name
Jesus, I feel Your love surround me
Jesus, I'm running to Your mercy
Your spirit inside of me
Now every chain is broken
Here I am finally free
When I call Your name
Jesus, I feel Your love surround me
Jesus, I'm running to Your mercy
Jesus, You're holding me together
Jesus, my heart is Yours forever
