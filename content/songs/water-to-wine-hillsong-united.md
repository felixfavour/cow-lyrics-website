Everlasting
So infinite in wildest love
My soul thirsts for the things above
Turn this water into wine
Blood and water
The mercy flowing from Your side
A river made of endless light
When my heart was running dry
So I'll stay
Stay in Your love
As long as life within me I'll remain
In who You are Lord
Take this wineskin
My spirit bursts for something new
There's nothing I want more than You
Only You can satisfy
So I'll stay
I'll stay in Your love
As long as life within me I'll remain
In who You are Lord
So I'll stay
Stay in Your love
In the vintage of Your heart
Lord only You could satisfy me
