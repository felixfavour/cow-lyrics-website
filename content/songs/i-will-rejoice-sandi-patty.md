He's the captain of a heavenly army
Praise Him, O praise Him
My defender no foe can harm me
Praise Him, O praise Him
Sheltering me in a mighty fortress
Praise Him, O praise Him
Holy is He, merciful and righteous
Praise Him, O praise Him
Make a joyful noise
I will rejoice
'Til the mountains and the valleys ring
I will rejoice
'Til the depths of my soul can sing
God reigns, let the earth proclaim
Lift high His name
(Lift high His holy name)
'Til the heavens shout back the same
I will rejoice
Sing a song when the battle's raging
Praise Him, O praise Him
The Lord will strengthen all those who praise Him
Praise Him, O praise Him
He is the rock of my salvation
Praise Him, O praise Him
Every voice in every nation
Praise Him, O praise Him
Make a joyful noise
