Down at Your feet, oh Lord
Is the most high place
In Your presence, Lord
I seek your face,I seek your face
For Down at Your feet, oh Lord
Is the most high place
In Your presence, Lord
We seek Your face, we seek Your face!
There is no higher calling, no greater honor
Than to bow and kneel before Your throne
I' m amazed at Your glory, embraced by Your mercy
Oh Lord, I live to worship You.
Down at Your feet, oh Lord
Is the most high place
In Your presence, Lord
I seek Your face, I seek Your face.
There is no higher calling, no greater honor
Than to bow and kneel before Your throne
I'm amazed at Your glory, embraced by Your mercy
Oh Lord, I live to worship You.
There is no higher calling, no greater honor
