Underneath the starry sky
A Mother holds a Child tonight
All is calm and all is bright (Bright, bright)
She sings to Him a lullaby
"Gloria!" (Gloria!)
I hear the angels singing, "Gloria!" (Gloria!)
All of the Heaven's ringing, "Gloria!"The Savior of the world is in Her arms
She's staring at the face of God
Staring at the face of God
She looks upon the Great I Am
The gift of Heaven in Her hands
Born to save the sons of Earth
He was born to give them second birth (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
"Gloria!" (Gloria!)
I hear the angels singing, "Gloria!" (Gloria!)
All of the Heaven's ringing, "Gloria!"The Savior of the world is in Her arms
She's staring at the face of God
