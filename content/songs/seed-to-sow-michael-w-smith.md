(chorus in Lugandan)
Kimu nkimaanyi
Buli muntu alina ensiigo
Omutima gwo gukulung 'aamye
Buli muntu alina ensiigo
Some people quietly reveal
In the manner of the meek
Some people shout the way they feel
To a radical degree
Some people sing it to express
While others hear another call
Some people speak with subtleness
Some don't rely on words at all
But let me tell you 'bout...
(chorus)
One thing I know
Everybody's got a seed to sow
Let your heart of hearts
Take you down the road
Everybody's got a seed to sow
We all are pieces of the whole
With different feelings to evoke
Giving distinction to the role
Different players-different strokes
But let me tell you 'bout...
