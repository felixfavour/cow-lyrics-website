Blessed are those who run to Him
Who place their hope and confidence in Jesus
He won’t forsake them
Blessed are those who seek His face
Who bend their knee and fix their gaze on Jesus
They won’t be shaken
Come on and praise the Lord with me
Sing if you love His Name
Come on and lift your voice with me
He’s worthy of all our praise
Blessed are those who walk with Him
Whose hеarts are set on pilgrimage with Jеsus
They’ll see His glory
Blessed are those who die to live
Whose joy it is to give it all for Jesus
And for Him only
Oh Jesus, all for Your glory
Come on and praise the Lord with me
Sing if you love His Name
Come on and lift your voice with me
He’s worthy of all our praise
Come on and bring your offering
Sing if you’ve known His grace
Come on and lift up your holy hands
He’s worthy of all our praise
