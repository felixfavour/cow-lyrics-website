V1
My   home   is   where   you   are
Your   doors   are   open   wide
Your   presence   pulls   my   heart
Invited   by   your   smile
Finally   I   can   breathe
You’re   breathing   life   in   me
We’re   standing   face   to   face
You   welcome   me   to   stay
Chorus
It   feels   like   home,   it   feels   like   home
When   I’m   with   you
It   feels   like   home
Here   in   your   love   is   where   I   belong
Your   presence   is   home
V2
You   never   run   away
Though   I   have   run   before
From   you   I   can’t   escape
My   heart   is   tied   to   yours
And   like   a   prodigal
You   look   beyond   my   fault
You   take   me   by   my   hand
Back   to   your   heart   again
