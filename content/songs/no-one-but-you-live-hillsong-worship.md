Who can melt the hardest heart
And speak life into my soul
Who can spin the world around
And hold me ever close
Who can search the depths of me
And love me to the core
Who controls the world I see
And walks me through it all
[Chorus: Aodhan King]
No one but You
No one but You
Who has made the righteous bright
Who has paved my way with grace
Loved me through my darkest hours
A thousand different ways
[Chorus: Aodhan King]
No one but You
No one but You
