Miracles when You move
Such an easy thing for You to do
Your hand is moving right now
You are still showing up
At the tomb of every Lazarus
Your voice is calling me out
Right now, I know You're able
And my God, come through again
You can do all things
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will
Everything's possible
By the power of the Holy Ghost
A new wind is blowing right now
Breaking my heart of stone
Taking over like it's Jericho
And my walls are all crashing down
But right now, I know You're able
And my God, come through again
You can do all things
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will
You can do all things
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
You never will (Oh, You never will)
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
You've never lost a battle (You've never lost a battle)
Never, never (You've never lost a battle)
So faithful
I know, I know, it's who You are
You can do all (You can do all things)
You can do all things, all things but fail (You can do all things but fail)
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
I know, I know
You never will
You can do all (You can do all things)
There's nothing impossible for You
You can do all things but fail
'Cause You've never lost a battle
No, You've never lost a battle
And I know, I know
You never will
Yes, I know, oh, I know
You never will
I know, I know
You never will
