*lyrics not final
There is revival right here and now
There is a fresh wind and I can hear the sound
Something truly wonderful is happening
There is a difference inside of me
More than a feeling, this is a prophecy
Something really powerful is happening
Darkness, bow down to the day
Mountains, get up out my way
Breaking out of yesterday
I got a new thing coming
Tell this giant in my face
You're not greater than my faith
Best believe mе when I say
I got a new thing coming
[Post-Chorus]
I got a new thing coming
I got a nеw thing coming
I got a new thing coming
There's an anointing to destroy the yoke
Tell every stronghold, you gotta let me go
Something really powerful is happening
There is a freedom that I have never known
Out of the shadows, into the overflow
Something really powerful is happening
