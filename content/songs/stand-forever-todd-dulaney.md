We won't keep quiet, we won't be ashamed
We'll keep confessing, Jesus, You reign
No matter how long, we'll keep on praying  [?]
Nothing can stop You, You will remain always
You stand forever, stand forever
Stand forever, stand forever
We won't keep quiet, we won't be ashamed
We'll keep confessing, Jesus, You reign
No matter how long, we'll keep on praying  [?]
Nothing can stop You, You will remain always
You stand forever, stand forever
Stand forever, stand forever
You stand forever, stand forever
Stand forever, stand forever
[Bridge]
We won't stop; calling Your name, calling Your name
We won't quit; seeking Your face, seeking Your face
We won't stop; calling Your name, calling Your name
We won't quit; seeking Your face, seeking Your face
We won't stop; calling Your name, calling Your name
We won't quit; seeking Your face, seeking Your face
We won't stop; calling Your name, calling Your name
We won't quit; seeking Your face, seeking Your face
