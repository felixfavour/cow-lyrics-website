Father, I love you
My heart is filled with desire to see
Your power and glory
Cover the earth as the waters clothe the sea
I am surrounded by the fortress of God
Totally surrendered to you
Padre te amo
En mi corazon, hay deseos de ver
Tu feurza y tu gloria
Que cubre la tierra
Como la aqua del mar
Estoy rodeada
Por la fortaleza de Dios
Completamente entregada a Ti
I lift up my hands, standing unashamed
I worship You Father, exalting your name
You've captured my heart, now my life has changed
I lift up my hands, I lift up my hands
I lift up my hands, standing unashamed
I worship You Father, exalting your name
Youâ€™ve captured my heart, now my life has changed
I lift up my hands
I lift up my hands
I lift up my hands
