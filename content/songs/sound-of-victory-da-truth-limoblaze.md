[Pre-Chorus: Limoblaze]
You hold me down like lo-lo-lo
Your love is sweet like mi-lo-lo
You make a promise, then You deliver
You never fail me, no-no-no
What type of loving, You wey dey fight all my battles
You put the boy on the way for this victory
Yeah, fight for the weak and the poor
That's how we gonna rise from the ashes
First, we get our knees to the floor
That's how we gon' find any answers
Can't find peace with the sword, yeah
That's how you know the fight is supernatural, yeah
Hot picks in the curb
Picks for the love when it's time for some action
Madigai, madigai, madigai
Fight, but you can't get to spoil yours, yeah
Madigai, madigai, madigai
Blood and bones on the soil, yeah
Walk with the bodyguard
Only go to war with the loyal, yeah
Things like arm, you cannot fall when God is for you
[Pre-Chorus: Limoblaze]
You hold me down like lo-lo-lo
Your love is sweet like mi-lo-lo
You make a promise, then You deliver
You never fail me, no-no-no
What type of loving, You wey dey fight all my battles
You put the boy on the way for this victory
So we're singing
