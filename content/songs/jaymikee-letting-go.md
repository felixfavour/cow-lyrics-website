I have come to your presence
I'm here to stay....
no more wandering and guessing another way
I don't mind if I have to stay forever
as long as it's you and I, I'm letting go for you
take my mind take my pride take it all away
Take my will take my time  take my everyday
I lay down all my dreams and my treasures
as long as it is you and I, I'm letting go... for you
nothing else really matter when you are here
I'm sure I can never remain the same
tho the heaven and Earth may fade away
as long as it is you and I, I'm letting go for you
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
I'm letting go (for you)
I'm letting go....
I'm letting go
I'm letting go for you
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
as long as is it you and I
I'm letting go for you
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
I'm letting go for you
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
as long as is it you and I...
letting go for you...
only your water can satisfy
no explanation can justify
the way that I feel when it's you and I
it's you and I , Jesus
let me remain in your word and grace
until the day we see face to face
forever it will be you and I
you and I Jesus
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
I'm letting go for you
I'm letting go
I'm letting go
as long as is it you and I
letting go for you
I'm letting go for you
I'm letting go for you
