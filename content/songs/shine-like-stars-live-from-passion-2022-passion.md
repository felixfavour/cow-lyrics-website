My eyes have seen the King of Glory
Oh I'll never be the same
Now I live to tell the story
Jesus is the only way
Jesus is the only way
I'm gonna burn bright
Gonna let love rise
I'm gonna shine like stars in the Heavens
I'm gonna burn bright
I got just one life
To shine like stars in the Heavens
There's no shadow that could hide it
There's no place Your love won't go
Light is breaking through the darkness
Therе's resurrection in my soul
You're thе fire in my bones
I'm gonna burn bright
Gonna let love rise
I'm gonna shine like stars in the Heavens
I'm gonna burn bright
I got just one life
To shine like stars in the Heavens
