If I tell you my life how I take reach here
You no go believe who dey there abeg bring Chair
One polo, one Jean, rotten palm slippers
12 years old I don stop to de sleep house
Ring the bell 12 o’clock suppose be breaking time
But to me and Kevwe Omo Na taking time
Tear people school Bag remove them belongings
Deep down I don’t know what I’m becoming
Headphone for my ear one old Walk man
De jam 2pac of course I no get work naw
Morning till night we de area de gamble
De struggle Police wear us government bangle (Handcuffs)
My role model that year Na them bros Ogbe
Na when e die I know say na ole ole (armed robber)
Community de find us we de Bush de kush
Officer relax, you never know who you de push
(Chorus )
If not for Jehovah, my life would have been over
Na baba God de bless me oh e de bless me oh
I no be super man oh but my life de him hand oh
Na baba God de bless me oh e de bless me oh
