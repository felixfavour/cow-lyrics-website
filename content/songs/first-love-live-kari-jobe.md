I’m returning to the secret place
Just an altar and a flame
Love is found here in our sacred space
I hear Your voice, I see Your face
You’re still my first love
You’re still my only one
You’re still my first love
You’re still my only one
There’s a table just for You and me
Break the bread and pour the wine
Perfect union, nothing in between
I am Yours and You are mine
You’re still my first love
You’re still my only one
You’re still my first love
You’rе still my only one
[Instrumental]
