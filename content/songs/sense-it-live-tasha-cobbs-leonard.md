[Intro]
Come on, don't stop your worship
Raise it, I can sense it, I can whooo
I can sense it, I can sense it
Something's changing
The glory of the Lord is in this place
I can sense it, I can sense it
Something's changing
The glory of the Lord is in this place
I've been searching (I've been searching for the location)
The place where God has fixed my situation
There is no place (There is no place)
Or sickness there (Or sickness there)
I feel my healing (I feel my healing, I'm finally here)
I can sense it (I can sense it)
I can sense it (I can sense it)
Something's changing (Something's changing)
The glory (The glory of the Lord is in this place)
Sing, "I can sense it" (I can sense it)
It's all in the room (I can sense it)
Something's changing (Something's changing)
The glory (The glory of the Lord is in this place)
Oh, yes it is
