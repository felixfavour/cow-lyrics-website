[Intro: Anna Golden]
Hey, oh-oh
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm
I feel hope rising in this room
The kind of faith that makes the mountains move
I can feel the turning of the tides
You're rushing in, You're rushing in
And I can see Your glory here and now
The miracles that we have read about
I can hear a generation cry
You're rushing in, You're rushing in
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
You always show up when we call You
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-woah
Oh, I feel hope rising in this room
The kind of faith that makes the mountains move
And I can feel the turning of the tides
You're rushing in,  rushing in
I can see Your glory here and now
The miracles that we have read about
And I can hear a generation cry
Rushing in,  rushing in
Woah-oh-oh-oh, yes, He is
