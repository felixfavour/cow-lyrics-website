I see myself through your eyes
Cos I have been reconciled
My name's in the book of life
oh oh oh
And I've been washed by the precious blood of the lamb
I see myself through your eyes
Cos I have been reconciled
My name's in the book of life

And I've been washed by the precious blood of the lamb
I see myself through your eyes
Cos I have been reconciled
My name's in the book of life
oh oh oh
And I've been washed by the precious blood of the lamb
