Living life like a toss a dice,
Brother, if e no work for your side,
E don't mean what we do is a lie,
Ehn,
Talk about my tithe and my offering,
I pay my tithe put an end to the suffering,
My life be turning on hin own,
You say, turning on hin own,
Don't talk down on the anointing,
Small talk can bring you down to nothing,
What you don't understand, leave it,
Makes no sense to still take a stand,
This is our life,
Our culture,
We are from Commonwealth of Zion,
We live by a different set of rules,
This is what we do,
This is how we rules
The word of God in my mouth

When I speak in tongues,

Even my tithe and offering
