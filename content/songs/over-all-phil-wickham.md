[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, ooh
Over our hopes, over our fear
God, You are over all
Over our joy, over our tears
God, You are over all
Over our hopes, over our fear
God, You are over all
Over our joy, over our tears
God, You are over all
Great in power
Exalted and lifted high
God, You will reign forever
Forever, we will glorify
The God over all
God over all
God over all
Over the earth, over the sky
God, You are over all
Over the dark, over the light
God, You are over all
Over the earth, over the sky
God, You are over all
