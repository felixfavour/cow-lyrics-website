oh oh oh
Even when the rain is falling
When my heart is aching
Pain is clotting
Lines are flowing empty
And my tears are racing
Still You are embracing
Talking to me more and more
Lord I know You know the story
You deserve the glory
You feel my pain when I can't remember 
Your mercies they endure
They will never end evermore
Lord I need You that is sure
More and more
And I
I will hide in You
Holy one my helper
Shelter from life's labor
And I
I will hide in You
You've become my healer
More and more
When you're passing through the water
You will not go under
Though you pass through fire
God will lift you higher
In the midst of pain
You will never ever walk in shame
You just praise His name
More and more
And I
I will hide in You
Holy one my helper
Shelter from life's labor
And I
I will hide in You
You've become my healer
More and more
More of you each day (More of you each day)
More of You I pray (Iyeh iyeh iyeh iyeh)
More of you each day (More of you each day)
More of You (Today)
More and more
More and more
More and more
More of You
More and more
More and more
More and more
More of You
Oh yeh oh Daddy oh oh
Oh yeh oh Daddy mi oh oh
I know You understand me oh oh
Oye O
I know that You feel me
O yes I know that You do
Oye o
That's why I need You
More and more
More and more
More and more
More of You
More and more
More and more
More and more
More of You
More and more
More and more
More and more
More of You
More and more
