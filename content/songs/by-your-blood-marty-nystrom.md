[Chorus]
By Your blood, You have saved us
By Your blood, You have freed us
By Your blood, We can enter
Into Your Holy place
By Your love, You forgave us
By Your pow'r, You have raised us
By Your blood, Precious blood
Of the Lamb
Father God in heaven
Precious Lamb of God
We humbly bow before You
And cry Holy, Holy
All heavenâ€™s singing
The song of the redeemed
Giving glory to the Lamb
By Your blood, You have saved us
By Your blood, You have freed us
By Your blood, We can enter
Into Your Holy place
By Your love, You forgave us
By Your pow'r, You have raised us
By Your blood, Precious blood
Of the Lamb
