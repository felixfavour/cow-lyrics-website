[Instrumental]
If my heart is overwhelmed and I cannot hear Your voice
I'll hold on to what is true, though I cannot see
And if the storms of life they come and the road ahead gets steep
I will lift these hands in faith, I will believe
[Pre-Chorus]
I remind myself of all that You've done
And the life I have because of Your son
'Cause love came down and rescued me
Love came down and set me free
Now I am Yours, I am forever Yours
Mountain high or valley low
I sing out, remind my soul
That I am Yours, I am forever Yours
When my heart is filled with hope and every promise comes my way
When I feel Your hands of grace rest upon me
Staying desperate for You, God, I'm staying humbled at Your feet
I will lift these hands and praise
I will believe
