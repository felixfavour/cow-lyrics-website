When you're weary and discouraged and your're feeling down and low when your friends forsake you and you have no place to go when your burdens feel too hard for you to try and bear just call on the Lord and he will be right there just call on the Lord and he will be right there
There have been times when I felt so all alone feeling like feeling like all my hope was gone I laid awake in my bed at night I wondering wondering wondering if everything will be alright then the master calmed the sea you now he came down from heaven and he he he rescued me just call call on the Lord and he'll he'll be right there ummm
