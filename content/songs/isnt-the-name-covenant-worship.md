Isn't the name of Jesus wonderful
Isn't the name of Jesus wonderful
All the world can come to Him
And have their sins removed
Isn't the name of Jesus wonderful
Isn't the name of Jesus beautiful
Isn't the name of Jesus beautiful
Son of God and one of us
The lover of our souls
Isn't the name of Jesus beautiful
Eternal king, You will reign forever
And we will sing, the glory of Your Name
Be lifted high, for all the world to see
Your Name is all they need
Your Name is all we need
Isn't the name of Jesus powerful
Isn't the name of Jesus powerful
Chains are broken when it's spoken
Every knee must bow
Isn't the name of Jesus powerful
