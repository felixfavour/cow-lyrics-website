This is the time
This is the hour
When I make my stand
There's no turning back
For Your kingdom is all that I want
Illuminate my heart
Pierce the dark
Until all is laid bare
Every hidden part
For Jesus You're all that I want

All that hinders I cast aside

Undivided
Here's my heart
It is Yours, It is Yours
Undivided
Take my life
I am Yours, I am Yours

With open hands I come
Everything is yours
I'm ready to let go
Take all of me
