I know you're working
Sometimes when i don't see it
You're working
Even when i don't believe it
You're still working
working overtime
On my matter
        2x
You're my beginning
And my end
You're everything in between
OH OH OH OOH
You're my beginning
And my end
You're everything in between
  2x
I know you're working
Even in my darkest hour
You're working
When i'm down
And feeling tired
You're still working
Working overtime
On my matter
        2x
You're my beginning
And my end
You're everything in between
OH OH OOH
You're my beginning
And my end
You're everything in between
   2x
God of miracles
You'll never change
The God who does
Impossible things
You're still the same
2x
You'll never change
The God who does
Impossible things
You're the same
4x
You're my beginning
And my end
You're everything in between
OH OH OOH
OH this i know that
You're my beginning
And my end
You are everthing in between
