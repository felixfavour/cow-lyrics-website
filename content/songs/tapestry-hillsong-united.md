Maker of earth and sky
And everything before our eyes
Your word formed life and light
Within the crucible of time
The genesis of all mankind
Our lives a tapestry of grace
Your hand has weaved together
In You no thread will ever fray
This hope is ours forever
Your work of art a mystery
Beyond all earthly measure
Your love for us a masterpiece
Jesus our hope always
Author of grace divine
Love orchestrated in our lives
The cross of Calvary
The gift of God, the centerpiece
Upon that cross You set us free
Our lives a tapestry of grace
Your hand has weaved together
In You no thread will ever fray
This hope is ours forever
Your work of art a mystery
Beyond all earthly measure
Your love for us a masterpiece
Jesus our hope always
