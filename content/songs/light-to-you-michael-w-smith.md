My hope has found its resting place
And I'll search no more
My hope has found its resting place
And I'll search no more
Even the darkness is light to You
Even the darkness is light to You
It's hard to believe it but You say that it's true
Even the darkness is light to You
My hope has found its anchor safe
And Your rock it holds
My hope has found its anchor safe
And Your rock it holds
Even the darkness is light to You
Even the darkness is light to You
It's hard to believe it but You say that it's true
Even the darkness is light to You
[Interlude]
