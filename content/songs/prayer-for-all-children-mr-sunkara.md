Isaiah 54:13-14 (NKJV) 
 All your children shall be taught by the LORD, And great shall be the peace of your children. In righteousness you shall be established; You shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear; And from terror, for it shall not come near you 

Declare over every child in our families and churches , that they are taught of the Lord, guided by the Spirit and established in righteousness, We frustrate the thoughts and tokens of wickedness directed towards them.

We affirm that they are comprehensive protected by day and night through the activity of angels, Their minds are inaccessible to negative ideologies of this world and they are extricated from evil companionship. In the Name of the Lord Jesus.*

✨Prayer  for children and youths around the world. Pray for their salvation and for those who are saved; declare that they are protected from every evil work of satan;

 pray for orphans and children living in the inner cities and war-torn regions, declaring deliverance, restoration and help in this time of need
