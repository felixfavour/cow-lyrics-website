Come close, listen to the story
About a love more faithful than the morning
[Pre-Chorus]
The Father gave His only Son just to save us
The earth was shaking in the dark
All creation felt the Father's broken heart
Tears were filling heaven's eyes
The day that true love died
The day that true love died
When blood and water hit the ground
Walls we couldn't move came crashing down
We were free and made alive
The day that true love died
The day that true love died
Search your heart, you know you can't deny it
Come on, lose your life just so you can find it
[Pre-Chorus]
The Father gave His only Son just to save us
