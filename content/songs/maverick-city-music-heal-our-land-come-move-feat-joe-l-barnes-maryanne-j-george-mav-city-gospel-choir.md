In a world where we're losing hope
And life has us on the ropes
Misunderstandings, hate running rampant
Every man out for his own
Seems like we lost our way
And the distance grows every day
Thought that we had it
Caught in the madness
Oh ain't it tragic?
But You said
If we turn from our wicked ways
Humbled ourselves and prayed
And seek Your face, You'd give us grace
Oh, come have your way Lord
Here we are
Abandoned hearts
On bended knees with outstretched arms
God hear us from hÐµaven
Send us Your presÐµnce
We need You Lord
We need You Lord
(We need You Lord
Verse 2: Joe L Barnes & Maryanne J. George]
Summer and spring may pass
But winter and fall won't last
I can trust The Creator is perfect in nature
Better is coming, I know
And just like the rising sun
My faith is rising up
You're the God of Your promise
And what you have started
You're faithful to finish
'Cause You said
If we turn from our wicked ways
And humbled ourselves and prayed
And seek Your face, You'd give us grace
Oh, come have your way God
Here we are
Abandoned hearts
On bended knees with outstretched arms
God hear us from heaven
Send us Your presence
We need You Lord
We need You Lord
We need You Lord
Right here, right now

Oh Lord, come and heal our land
Oh Lord, come and heal our land
Oh Lord, come and heal our land
(Only you can do it)
Oh Lord, come and heal our land
(We need You Lord)
Oh Lord, come and heal our land
(We need a move of Your Spirit, come and heal)
Oh Lord, come and heal our land
(Right here, right now, right here God)
Oh Lord, come and heal our land
(We're desperate, we're desperate God)
Oh Lord, come and heal our land
Here we are
Abandoned hearts
On bended knees with outstretched arms
God hear us from heaven
Send us Your presence
We need You Lord
We need You Lord
(Here we are)
Here we are
Abandoned hearts
On bended knees with outstretched arms
God hear us from heaven
Send us Your presence
We need You Lord
We need You Lord
(We're desperate, we need you Lord)
Here we are
Abandoned hearts
On bended knees with outstretched arms
God hear us from heaven
Send us Your presence
We need You Lord
We need You Lord
We need You Lord
We need you Lord
