Curse of rejection
You can’t stay here
Lies of fear you’re not welcome here
I have been too Comfortable
Living in you
Now the King has come
To my Rescue
Chorus
You will bow to your knees
I’m not Living
In what you Planned for me
I am a Child of the King
And as I decide to lay you aside
You Must Break
And as I decide to lay you aside
You Must Break
Curse of insecurity
You can’t stay here
Lies of anxiety
You’re not welcome here
I have been too comfortable
Living in you
Now thе King has come
To my Rescue
