...(spoken prayer)
father you are so faithful
you are so holy
you are so perfect
you are so near, so near
you are so close
we acknowledge  your presence in this place
we thank you for the opportunity to be close to you
we thank you for the opportunity  to be part of what you are doing in the earth
hallelujah .
creation is groaning
awaiting for your son's and daughters  to realise who they are are
we thank you for allowing us to be a part of the movement that is awaking your son's and daughters
awaking in the sleeping soul
we thank you for the resurrection power that is in worship
we thank you for your spirit ,the same power that ressurected Jesus Christ from the dead is the same spirit and power that lives inside of us even now as we worship
we worship from our spirit
You can stay here a little while longer
I enjoy when You're around, Lord

Come on in, take a seat
I made room for You and me
Never leave, oh Jesus, stay with me
Come on in, take a seat
I made room for You and me
Never leave, oh Jesus, stay with me
Come on in, take a seat
I made room for You and me
Never leave, oh Jesus, stay with me
Come on in, take a seat
I made room for You and me
Never leave, oh Jesus, stay with me
