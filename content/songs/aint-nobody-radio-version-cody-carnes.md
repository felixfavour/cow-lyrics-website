[Intro]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I got a story (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Too good to hide (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I was a blind man wanderin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Until I saw the light (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, I got a story (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I can't deny (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'm a living, breathing miracle (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
And I just gotta testify (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ayy)
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
Ain't nobody love me this good
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
And I know, I know nobody could
Tell me who could give me this freedom
Tell me who could get me this far
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
And I know, I know nobody could
[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
