You had me standing on a mountain
Walking through barren lands
You took my hand and You said
You can have this world
But I won't go with you
Oh, I won't go with you

But I ran out of places
And feelings I was chasing
All I have is You and You alone
And I said

Hold on, wait a minute
I don't want what You ain't in, and
I don't wanna go unless I'm going there with You
It's You there, rain or shining
You're the sun on my horizons
You are my everything
My promised land is You

One thing I ask, and this I'll seek
Is to live and to dwell in the house of the King
And if that means that I leave
All of my things
Then, I will go with You
Oh, I will go with You

But I ran out of places
And feelings I was chasing
All I have is You and You alone
And I said

Hold on, wait a minute
I don't want what You ain't in, and
I don't wanna go unless I'm going there with You
It's You there, rain or shining
You're the sun on my horizons
You are my everything
My promised land is You

Where could I run, could I go?
Your Spirit will follow me down to Sheol
And the thing about the King
He's always with me
So I can't run from You
But I won't run from You
And I said

Hold on, wait a minute
I don't want what You ain't in, and
I don't wanna go unless I'm going there with You
It's You there, rain or shining
You're the sun on my horizons
You are my everything
My promised land is You
You are my everything
My promised land is You
