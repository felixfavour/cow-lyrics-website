Verse 1]
{Let Me Want What You Want
Oh my dear Lord
Let Me Love What You Love
Oh dear Lord
That is how you designed
Life to be Lord
Help me Lord to Live
How I ought to Live} [x2]

{Oh Lord take me to the Place
Where I have no Will
That is separate from your Will
Oh Lord take me to the Place
Where I have no Choice
That is separate from your Choice
To be Lost in you is my Desire
To be all for you is all I Want} [x2]
[Let Me Want What You Want  by Paul Enenche & Family]
{Let my Life bring you Joy
And not Pain Lord
Let me live in your Plan
For my Life
That is Living Life
At it's very Best Lord
That is Living to Glorify your Name} [x2]

{Oh Lord take me to the Place
Where I have no Will
That is separate from your Will
Oh Lord take me to the Place
Where I have no Choice
That is separate from your Choice
To be Lost in you is my Desire
To be all for you is all I Want} [x2]
Set me Free from myself
Oh my dear Lord
From the ways of the Flesh
Set me Free
So I can avoid the ways of Regrets
So my Life can bring Pleasure
To you Lord} [x2]

{Oh Lord take me to the Place
Where I have no Will
That is separate from your Will
Oh Lord take me to the Place
Where I have no Choice
That is separate from your Choice
To be Lost in you is my Desire
To be all for you is all I Want} [x2]
