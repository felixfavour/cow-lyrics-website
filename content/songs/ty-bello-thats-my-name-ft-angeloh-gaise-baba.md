I am loved

I am loved by God
Jesus
I am loved

I am loved by You
Eh eh eh eh

That's my name
That's my name
That's my name
Always my name
That's my name
That's my name
That's my name
That's my name
And so the mountains must get out
Of my way
By You they crash and fall
And become like nothing before me
For I know they're are nothing before You
I tell the mountains to get out of my way
They must fold and fall
And become like nothing before me
For I know they're nothing before You
Ofe mi

Ofe mi O

Ofe mi O
Na only You be fit to come down from
The Heavenly of the heavenlies
To die for me
Only to You be fit to go down
To depths of hell
To rescue me
Aya ya ya ya ya ya
No mountain high no valley low
Nothing fit separate me from Your love
You dey with me I'm not alone
You never fail me this I know
Aya ya ya ya ya ya
And so the mountains must get out
Of my way
By You they crash and fall
And become like nothing before me
For I know they're are nothing before You
I tell the mountains to get out of my way
They must fold and fall
And become like nothing before me
For I know they're nothing before You
I am loved
I am loved
I am loved by God
Jesus
I am loved
I am loved
I am loved by You
