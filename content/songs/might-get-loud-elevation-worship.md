Excuse me for a minute
But I've got a song to sing
'Might not be on-key
But it’s from my heart
No one else can tell it
What the Lord has done for me
This might take all-day
So, I better start right now
[Chorus: Brandon Lake & Chris Brown]
And it might get loud
It might get loud
'Cause Heaven’s coming
Down, down, down
And it might get loud
It might get loud
Heaven’s coming
Down, down, down
And it might get loud
I don’t have a halo
No, I’m not a perfect man
I’m just glad to be a child of God
'Cause when I think of
Where I could've been
Should’ve been, would’ve been
If He hadn’t stepped in
I've got a praise on the Inside
That can’t be denied
And I gotta get it out right now
