{I am your Own, I am your Own
Till the Day you will come
Jesus, I am your Own} [x2]
You are my Everything
You are my Standard
Till the Day you will come again
Jesus, I am your Own
I am your Own, I am your Own
Till the Day you will come again
Jesus, I am your Own
You are my Melody
You are my Standard
Till the Day Christ will come
Speaking in Tongues
I am your Own, I am your Own
Till the Day you will come again
Jesus, I am your Own
You are my Melody
You are my Standard
Till the Day you will come
Jesus, I am your Own 
{If you Leave me now, Where will I go
If you Leave me now, Where will I Stand oh.  Jesus, Jesus, Jesus You are my Anchor for Life oh} [x3]
{I am your Own, I am your Own
Till the Day you will come
Jesus, I am your Own} [x2]
You are my Melody
You are my Standard
Till the Day Christ will come
Jesus, I am your Own
