My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame  
But wholly trust in Jesus name
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly trust in Jesus name
Christ alone, cornerstone
Weak made strong, in the savior's love
Through the storm
He is lord, lord of all
When darkness seems to hide his face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil
My anchor holds within the veil
Christ alone, cornerstone 
Weak made strong, in the savior's love 
Through the storm 
He is lord, lord of all
He is lord, lord of all
Christ alone, cornerstone
Weak made strong, in the savior's love
Through the storm 
He is lord, lord of all
Christ alone, cornerstone
Weak made strong, in the savior's love
Through the storm 
He is lord, lord of all
Then he shall come with trumpets sound
Oh, may i then in him be found  
Dressed in his righteousness alone
Faultless, stand before the throne
