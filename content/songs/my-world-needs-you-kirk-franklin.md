Show me your face
Fill up this space
My world needs you right now
My world needs you right now
I can't escape
Being afraid
Fill me with you right now
My world needs you right now
Show me your face
Fill up this space
My world needs you right now
My world needs you right now
I can't escape
Being afraid
Fill me with you right now
My world needs you right now
[Chorus: Tasha Cobbs]
Power fall down
Bring with it a sound
That points us to you right now
Erase substitutes right now
Fix what I see
And God please fix me
My world needs you right now
Let us see you right now
My world needs you right now
