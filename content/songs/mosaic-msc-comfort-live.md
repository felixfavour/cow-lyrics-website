Before I reach out my arms You open up Yours
Before I pour out my heart You know every thought
I will be anxious for nothing, hold on to one thing
My Comfort, my Peace
I will be safe in Your presence, so fierce and so tender
My Comfort, my Peace
Your voice stronger than fear
Waits in the night
Your words tear through the dark
Flood it with light
Fill it with fire
I will be anxious for nothing, hold on to one thing
My Comfort, my Peace
I will be safe in Your presence, so fierce and so tender
My Comfort, my Peace
You are my Comfort, You are my Peace
You won't forsake me
You won't betray me
You'll never fail me
And I won't be afraid
You won't forsake me
You won't betray me
You'll never fail me
And I won't be afraid
You will protect me
You will defend me
You're standing with me
And I won't be afraid
You will protect me
You will defend me
You're standing with me
And I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
And I will be anxious for nothing, hold on to one thing
My Comfort, my Peace
I will be safe in Your presence, so fierce and so tender
My Comfort, my Peace
I will be anxious for nothing, hold on to one thing
My Comfort, my Peace
I will be safe in Your presence, so fierce and so tender
My Comfort, my Peace
