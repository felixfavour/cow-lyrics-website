[Intro: Kirk Franklin & Mav City Gospel Choir]
(Ooh, ooh) Lord, let Your will be done on Earth
(Ooh, ooh) As it is in Heaven
(Ooh, ooh) Help us to love and see each other
(Ooh, ooh) The way You love and see us, come on
My heart has always longed for something more
I searched the stars to knock on Heaven's door
Creation groans for God to be revealed
Every wound we carry will be healed
[Pre-Chorus: Chandler Moore]
My eyes on the Son
Lord, Your will be done
[Chorus: Chandler Moore & Mav City Gospel Choir, 
Kirk Franklin
]
Thine is the Kingdom (Yeah)
The power, the glory (Yeah)
Forever and ever (Yeah)
He finished my story (Yeah)
We're singing freedom
Our testimony (Say it, y'all)
We'll be singing forever, amen (We'll be singing forever)
We'll be singing forever and ever, amen (
Hallelujah
, oh, oh, na)
