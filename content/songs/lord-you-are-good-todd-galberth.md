Lord you are good
You've been so good
Lord you are good
You've been better than good
I can't praise you enough
I owe you my life
Can't praise you enough
Even if I tried cause
You've been so good to me

Lord you are good
You've been so good
Lord you are good
You've been better than good
I can't praise you enough
I owe you my life
Can't praise you enough
Even If I tried cause
You've been so good to me

Lord you are good
You've been so good
Lord you are good
You've been better than good
I can't praise you enough
I owe you my life
Can't praise you enough
Even If I tried cause
You've been so good to me

Lord you are good
You've been so good
Lord you are good
You've been better than good
I can't praise you enough
I owe you my life
Can't praise you enough
Even If I tried cause
You've been so good
You've been so good
You've been so good to me

So many doors you've opened
So many ways you've made
So many times you've healed me

So many doors you've opened
So many ways you've made
So many times you've healed me
You've been better than good to me

So many doors you've opened
So many ways you've made
So many times you've healed me
You've been better than good to me

So many doors you've opened
So many ways you've made
So many times you've healed me
You've been better than good to me

You've been better than good to me [repeat]

I can never repay you Lord
I can never repay you Lord
I can never repay you Lord
For what you've done for me
How you loose my shackles and
How you set me free
How you made a way
When there was no way
How you made a way
When there was no way
How you made a way
When there was no way oh God
you made a way
'Cause you've been so good

You've been so good [repeat]

To me...

You've been better than good to me [repeat]
