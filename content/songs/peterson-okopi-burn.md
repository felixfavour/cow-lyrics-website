ybody know we are the burning generation
And our fire will never be consumed
Because we are a city set upon a hill that can not be hidden~~
Somebody just blast in the holy ghost if you can
I've come with open heart
To the audience of one
To be just like him
I've come with open heart
To the audience of one
So I can be just like him
Come on everybody help me
Say I've come with open heart
I've come with open heart - (call)
To the audience of one
To be just like you  ( 4x)
Let me be like that oh
Let me be like this oh
I want to  burn
Burn, burn for you till I'm empty
Let me be like that oh
Let me be like this oh
I want to  burn
Burn, burn for you till I'm done
Let me be like that oh  - ( three part)
Let me be like this oh
I want to  burn
Burn, burn for you till I'm empty
Let me be like that oh
Let me be like this oh

Burn, burn for you till I'm done
