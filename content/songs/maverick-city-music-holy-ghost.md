Consuming fire
My heart's desire
Oh, how I need You more
A fresh outpour
With no resistance
I give permission
So come now, invade my heart
This life is Yours
Come fill me up, Holy Ghost
Shine brighter till the whole world knows Yourâlove
Yourâlove
Comeâset me onâa holy fire
Burnâbright until the whole world finds Your love
Your love
Come fill me up, Holy Ghost
Shine brighter till the whole world knows Yourâlove
Yourâlove
Comeâset me onâa holy fire
Burnâbright until the whole world finds Your love
Your love
Consuming fire
My heart's desire
Oh, how I need You more
A fresh outpour
With no resistance
I give permission
So come now, invade my heart
This life is Yours
Come fill me up, Holy Ghost
Shine brighter till the whole world knows Your love
Your love
Come set me on a holy fire
Burn bright until the whole world finds Your love
Your love
This is my one desire
And only this I seek
To be a living fire
Consumed completely
This is my one desire
And only this I seek
To be a living fire
Consumed completely
This is my one desire
And only this I seek
To be a living fire
Consumed completely
This is my one desire
And only this I seek
To be a living fire
Consumed completely
Come fill me up, Holy Ghost
Shine brighter till the whole world knows Your love
Your love
Come set me on a holy fire
Burn bright until the whole world finds Your love
Your love
This is my one desire
And only this I seek
To be a living fire
Consumed completely
This is my one desire
And only this I seek
To be a living fire
Consumed completely
Come fill me up, Holy Ghost
