In Your cross
I've found my peace
All my sins are washed away
Fear is gone and heaven found
Now I breathe Your precious grace
Jesus, our Lord Jesus
With thankful hearts
We worship You again
Jesus, our Lord Jesus
With hearts of fire
We worship Christ the King
At the gates of life
You stand
The Son of Man who is the way
All power and might
Is in Your hand
Christ is risen from the grave
Jesus, our Lord Jesus
With thankful hearts
We worship You again
Jesus, our Lord Jesus
With hearts of fire
We worship Christ the King
