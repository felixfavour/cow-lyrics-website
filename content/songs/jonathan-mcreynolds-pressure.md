I can't even turn on my phone
without be reminded of lack
that I'm alone and broken and unsuccessful
I can't always talk to my friends
Cuz' they've got expectation
that I may or may not be living up to my?
I really need rid myself
Of the pressure, pressure, pressure
to be someone else
that the world has made
Jesus take from me
all the pressure, pressure, pressure
to be someone else
you did not create
Help me, be me,
and only, see you,
let me decrease
and glorify you
Help me
I thought my intentions were good
just act like a christian should
and hope someone watching would approve of me
Inspite of your word
If you're not feeling my show?
Than how far could I go
before all of my accomplishments
going down in fire
Just because of the
pressure, pressure, pressure
to be someone else the chruch has made
Jesus take from me
all the pressure, pressure, pressure
to be someone else that you did not create
Help me, be me,
and only, see you,
let me decrease
and glorify you
Help me, be me,
and only, see you,
let me decrease
and glorify you
Help me, be me,
and only, see you,
let me decrease
and glorify you
I just wanna live, I just wanna live for you
nobody else but you
I just wanna live, I just wanna live for you
nobody else but you
I just wanna live, I just wanna live for you
nobody else but you
