He whispers in my ear
Tells me that I'm fearless
He shares a melody
Tells me to repeat it
And it makes me whole
It reminds my soul
I am all He says I am
I am all He says I am
I am all He says I am
And He says I am His own
I was blinded by scales upon my
Eyes then he came like a light
Burned up all the lies
And He set me free
He reminded me
I am all He says I am
I am all He says I am
I am all He says I am
And He says I am His own
