Mercy with the morning sun
Hope when I am hanging by a thread
Every time I look for it, I find
Your faithfulness again
Water in the wilderness
My Defender in the lion's den
Every time I look for it, I find
Your faithfulness again
Faithful then, faithful now
You never run out of
Faithfulness, faithfulness
Woah-oh-oh
Faithful then, faithful now
You never run out of
Faithfulness, faithfulness
Love that held Him to the cross
'Til He paid the price for all my sin
A temporary tomb was sealed by stone
But it couldn't keep Him in
Now that He has conquered death
Tell me, what's impossible for Him?
If the Lord, my God is on my side
Then who can be against?
