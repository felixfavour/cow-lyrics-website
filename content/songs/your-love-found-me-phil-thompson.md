I will not refrain from You, I'm never letting go
I found my life when I found You, so I'll keep holding on
'Cause You'll never abandon, Your love has been my standard
I will not refrain from You
'Cause there are no heights, there is no depth
Not any powers, that can separate
There is no life, not even death
The present or future, that can separate
From Your love (Oh, oh, oh, ohh)
From Your love (Oh, oh, oh, ohh)
I will not refrain from You, I'm never letting go
I found my life when I found You, so I'll keep holding on
'Cause You'll never abandon, Your love has been my standard
I will not refrain from You
There are no heights, there is no depth
Not any powers, that can separate
There is no life, not even death
The present or future, that can separate
From Your love (Oh, oh, oh, ohh)
From Your love (Oh, oh, oh, ohh)
Hey!
