Concerned about His children
(
Someone asked a question
) Someone asked a question
(
Why do we sing?
) Why do we sing?
(
When we lift our hands to Jesus
) When we lift our hands to Jesus
(
What do we really mean?
) What do we really mean?
(
Someone may be wondering
) Someone may be wondering
(
When we sing our song
) When we sing our song
(
At times we may be crying
) At times we may bе crying
(
And nothing's even wrong
) And nothing's evеn wrong
[Chorus: Mav City Gospel Choir & Brandon Lake,

(
Wave your hand in the air and say, "I sing because") I sing because I'm happy
(
I sing because I'm free
) I sing because I'm free
(
His eye is on the sparrow
) His eye is on the sparrow
(
That's the reason why I sing
) That's the reason why I sing
(
I need somebody to help me say, "Glory")
Glory, hallelujah
(
You're the reason why
) You're the reason why I sing
(
Say, "Glory, hallelujah") Glory, hallelujah
(
You're the reason why I sing
) You're the reason why I sing
(
And when the song is over
) And when the song is over
(
We've all said "Amen") We've all said "Amen"(
And your heart just keep on singing
) And your heart just keeps on singing
(
And the song will never end
) And the song will never end
(
And if somebody asks you
) And if somebody asks you
(
Was it just a show?
) Was it just a show?
(
Lift your hands and be a witness
) Lift your hands and be a witness
(
And tell the whole world, "No") And tell the whole world, "No"(
Shh, and when we cross that river
) And when we cross that river
(
To study war no more
) To study war no more
(
We will sing our song to Jesus
) We will sing our song to Jesus
(
The One whom we adore
