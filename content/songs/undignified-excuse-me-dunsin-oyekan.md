I wanna Testify
(I wanna Testify)
I wanna Testify
(I wanna Testify)
I wanna Testify
(I wanna Testify)
Many battles
Many struggles
But God has been there for me
Fighting for me
Winning for me
He has never lost a fight
Many battles
Many struggles
But God has been there for me
Fighting for me
Winning for me
He has never lost a fight
The Number of my scars
Are the number of my victories
Thatâ€™s why my praise
Can never be the same as yours
