Hold my heart, don't let it bleed no more
Sometimes forgiveness is like a man at war
God only knows why love is worth the fall
Maybe that's what makes it love
Maybe that's what makes it love
[Chorus: Joel Houston, Taya Smith, and Jonathon "JD" Douglass]
I can hear it now, the everlasting sound
Roaring like a lion deep within me
I won't hold it long, I wasn't made that strong
Sweet surrender, hold my heart and not let go
I'm letting go
And Heaven knows
I love you so
Hold my heart, don't let it break like fear
Sometimes a moment feels like a thousand years
God only knows why love is drenched in tears
Maybe that's what makes it love
Maybe that's what makes it love
[Chorus: Joel Houston, Taya Smith, and Jonathon "JD" Douglass]
I can hear it now, the everlasting sound
Roaring like a lion deep within me
I won't hold it long, I wasn't made that strong
Sweet surrender, hold my heart and not let go
I'm letting go
And Heaven knows
I love you so
