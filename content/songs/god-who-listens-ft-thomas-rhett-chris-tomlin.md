Oh, oh, oh, oh
The God who made the winters and the summers
The One who put the stars all in their place
The only One who stands above all others
He knows me by name
The angels hide their faces in His presence
The demons run for cover when You speak
You rule the world and reign above the heavens
And still draw close to me
And when I close my eyes
I know that
I'm not just hopin', I'm not just wishin'
I know I'm prayin' to a God who listens
I know He hears me, I know He's livin'
Yes, I am prayin' to a God who listens
He walks with me and leads me by still waters
I lay my troubles down at His feet (lay my troubles down)
It's amazing that the Savior and the Father
He is (He is) a friend (a friend) to me
How can it be, oh?
I'm not just hoping, I'm not just wishing
I know I'm praying to a God who listens
I know He hears me, I know He's living
Yes, I am praying (yes, I am praying') to a God who listens
You're God who listens
Who knows me, who loves me
Who never will fail me
Who tells me that I am His own
And You surround me, remind me
You always are for me
So I come boldly to Your throne
I'm not just hoping, I'm not just wishing
Yes, I am praying to a God who listens
Oh, Lord a promise, that we've been given
Yes, we are praying to a God who listens
Yes, You are, yes You are
Ooh, yeah, oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, oh-oh
I'm not just hoping (I'm not just hoping)
I'm not just wishing (I'm not just wishing')
