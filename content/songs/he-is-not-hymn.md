He is not a disappointment!
Jesus is far more to me
Than in all my glowing daydreams
I had fancied He could be;
And the more I get to know Him,
So the more I find Him true,
And the more I long that others
Should be led to know Him too.

He is not a disappointment,
He is All-in-All to me!
Savior, sanctifier, Keeper,
Now and thro’ eternity.

He is not a disappointment!
He has saved my soul from sin;
All the guilt and all the anguish
Which oppressed my heart within,
He has banished by His presence,
And His blessed kiss of peace
Has assured my heart for ever
That His love will never cease

He is not a disappointment!
He is all in all to me—
Savior, Sanctifier, Keeper;
The unchanging Christ is He!
He has won my heart’s affections,
And He meets my ev’ry need;
He is not a disappointment,
For He satisfies indeed. [Refrain]
