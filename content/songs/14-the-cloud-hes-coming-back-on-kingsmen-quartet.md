Early one morning I walked out the doorway stopped to look up to the sky. Thinking that this may be the exact day that Jesus will sound forth the cry

There was nothing but blue sky with one little white cloud slowly slipping a long. I got so excited that I shouted out loud this may be the cloud he's coming back on

This may be the cloud he's coming back on. For we all know that it is not long. 
The signs for the learning point to his returning. And I got a longing for home.

I keep my eyes on the sky and I do what he says do.
Soon I will hear Jesus cry
Gabriel's trumpet will sound and I'll lift off the ground.
To the cloud that he's coming back on.

Well, When you're feeling a little blue. Don't let your troubles get you down, leave your sorrows behind, Step outside.  Take the time to look all around.

Keep your eyes on the sky and get ready to fly. When you see the cloud slipping along. You may get so excited that you shout it out loud. This may be the cloud he's coming back on. 

This may be the cloud he's coming back on. For we all know that it is not long. 
The signs for the learning point to his returning. And I got a longing for home.

Gabriel's trumpet will sound and I will lift off the ground, to the cloud He's coming back on!
