ti:Chioma Jesus- I Got Power]
Oh ive got the power
You have the power
To conquer the devil
The power to break every chain
The power to break every yoke
At the name of Jesus
Every kneel must bow down
Ive got power
Ive got power to conquer the devil
Ive got power
Ive got authority to conquer my enemies
At the cross of calvary Jesus gave me the power
At the cross of calvary he released the power
Ice got authority to crush my enemies
At the name of Jesus
Every knee must bow down
At the name of Jesus
They must tremble
For he that is born of God
Overcometh the world
Im not afraid
Im not afraid of the devil
For the righteous they as bold as zion
That's why I raise my voice to shout the name of Jesus
At the name of Jesus Christ
Every must bow down
When I call the name Jesus
Chains are broken
There is power, here is power
Every knee must bow down
In the name of Jesus Christ
Chains are broken
I will tread upon serpents and scorpions
Every knee must bow down
In the name of Jesus none shall hurt me
Chains are broken
At the name of Jesus Christ
Every knee must bow down
Every chain in your life is broken
Chains are broken
Every chain in your marriage is broken
Every knee must bow down
Every chain holding your life is broken
Chains are broken
In the name of Jesus every power will go down
Every knee must bow down
Every shackle are broken in Jesus name
Chains are broken
(Instrumentals)
When you call Jesus every chain will be broken
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the blood of Jesus
There is power in the blood of Jesus
You are a conqueror in the name of Jesus
You are a winner in the name of Jesus
You are a champion in the name of Jesus
Oh I am born to win in the name of Jesus
I will rule in the midst of my enemies
