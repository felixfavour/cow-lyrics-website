I’m stretching out
From where I am to where He’s taking me
On faith I clap, believing that strongholds are broken
When I praise
On faith I dance, receiving a new heart for You
My hands are raised
There is a reason why I spin
There is a purpose why I shout
Lord as I worship take me in
And pour Your Spirit out
I stretch my praise, reaching out for You
My hands are raised, worshipping the Truth
And Living God You are
The Living God You are
I stretch for You
Reaching out for You
Reaching out for Heaven
God You are the First, The Last, The Living God
Reaching out for Truth
Reaching out in Worship
God You are the First, The Last, The Living God
