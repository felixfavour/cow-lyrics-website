We've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been turning living rooms into life rooms
Four years of school to get to college
Four years of bad for a degree
It's easier to master knowledge
Than it is to master me
But I'm making this my graduation party
It took awhile for me to make it there
When I showed up the ceremony started
I threw my cap up in the air, ooh
Oh, I know, I gotta graduate
Can't stay here forever, gotta graduate
Old things pass away when I graduate
All things become blue when I graduate
Thank the Lord that I'm much smarter
Than I'd ever thought I'd be
I won't fail again, I promise, hey
And that's a promise that I gotta keep
So I'm making this my graduation party
It took awhile for me to make it here
When I showed up the ceremony started
I threw my cap up in the air, oh
Oh, I know, I gotta graduate
Can't stay here forever, gotta graduate
Can anybody help me try to graduate
Gotta grow up now and graduate
I've gotta graduate
Yeah, I've gotta graduate
Oh, I know it's time, I better graduate
Gotta move on, graduate
Hey, what once was in the wishing well (Graduate)
Is now in the rear view (Graduate)
The enemy gonna have to come up with something new (Graduate)
'Cause I ain't [?] graduate, hey
Ooh, graduate
Ooh, graduate
Ooh, graduate
Ooh, graduate
Ooh, yeah
Keep it going, graduation
You gotta celebrate, graduate
Today you are great, graduation has arrived
It's upon ya, you're going to the next level
Next level, next level
