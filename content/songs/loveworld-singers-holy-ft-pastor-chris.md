Everlasting Father, Righteous and so gracious
Beauty of all creation
Your right hand is full of power
Glorious in holiness, great are your works, oh Lord
Your hands formed the dry lands
Great are You Lord
Holy One is of lsrael in every star Your wisdom shines
The heavens praise Your wonders
You are greatly to be feared oh Lord
Master and my ruler, mighty King, You reign supreme
Heaven and earth shall pass away
Your name endures forever
Lord Jesus, The God of Abraham
The God of Isaac
The Godof Jacob
You are my God
The strong and breasted One
I live for you forevermore
Almighty God
You're Holy, holy holy
So Great and full of mercy, mercy, mercy
The earth is full of Your Glory, glory, glory
Forever You are Worthy, worthy, worthy
Lord Jesus, The God of Abraham
The God of Isaac
The Godof Jacob
You are my God
The strong and breasted One
I live for you forevermore
