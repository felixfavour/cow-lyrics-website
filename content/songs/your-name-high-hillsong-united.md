Your innocence forsaken
Upon that cross
You gave Yourself for us
Carried into Your freedom
Our broken past replaced in
A second chance
The chains have come undone
Death defied in the Father’s love
We are
Living to make Your Name high, Jesus
Living to make Your Name high, Jesus You
Gave what the world couldn’t offer us
Say what they want, Say what they want
[Hook]
We are free
Whoa oh oh
The atmosphere is changing
Oh can You hear
The people rising up
In the hope of Your freedom
