I will come to You
With an open heart
And bring a sacrifice of praise
I have seen Your power
In the Holy Place
And I have known Your mighty ways
I will remember Your mercy
And Lord Your faithfulness
Lord Your goodness
And Your love will follow me
All the days of my life
IÂ’m surrounded
With the favour of the Lord
Always and forever
