You promised salvation
To bring your children home
You promised redemption
That your love would restore
Pre-chorus:
We can see you all around
Chorus:
This is the day
This is the time
When all you spoke
Has come alive
We've seen you move
We've seen you fight
We've seen it all cause you are on our side
You promised our city
Would be shaken with your love
You promised Your Spirit
Would change the world through us
Bridge:
For your glory, your fame Lord
We surrender our lives
