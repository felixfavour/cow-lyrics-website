As Your eyes look over the earth
May You find a little flame ever burning
As You search for one devoted
May You find my heart ever yearning
I want to bring You something You desire
Would You take this little oil make a fire
Meet me at this altar
Lord I am here for You
Consecrate me, I choose no other
I vow my love to You
I'll bring my offering
But You’re worth so much more than I could give
If my life could fill Your longing
Here I am Lord, here's my everything
Keep me broken for Your presence
And don't put me back together
I want to stay forever like this
Til’ I'm ruined for what's less than
The fullness of Your presence
I want to stay forever like this
