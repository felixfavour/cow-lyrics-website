You woke me up this morning
Yeah, my cup is overflowing
You have blessed me and I know it
So I owe You my praise
You're the author of my story
And I thought that it was over
But Your mercy kept me going
So I owe You my praise
Praises, oh Lord, You deserve
Oh Lord, You deserve all my
Praises, oh Lord, You deserve
Only You deserve all my praise
[Interlude]
I know I'm far from finished
But Your grace is still sufficient
And that's what makes the difference
So I owe You my praisе
Now I'm standing here forgiven
Knowing lifе is worth the living
You're the God of new beginnings
So I owe You my praise
