When the weight of the world begins to fall
On the Name of Jesus I will call
For I know my God is in control
And His purpose is unshakable
Doesn't matter what I feel
Doesn't matter what I see
My hope will always be
In Your promises to me
Now I'm casting out all fear
For Your love has set me free
My hope will always be
In Your promises to me
As I walk into the days to come
I will not forget what You have done
For you have supplied my every need
And Your presence is enough for me
[Bridge]
You will always be more than enough for me
You will always be more than enough for me
Nothing's gonna stop the plans You've made
Nothing's gonna take Your love away
You will always be more than enough for me
