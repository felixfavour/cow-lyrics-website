Ain't Nobody"
I've got a story
Too good to hide
I was a blind man wandering
Until I saw the light
Yeah, I've got a story
I can't deny
I'm a living breathing miracle
And I just gotta testify
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
Ain't nobody love me this good
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
And I know, I know nobody could
Tell me who could give me this freedom
Tell me who could get me this far
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
And I know, I know nobody could
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Now I'm anointed
To bring the news
Everything He did for me
I know He'll do for you
He gave me joy for the mourning
For the ashes a crown
Yeah, I'm a walking talking miracle
And I just gotta let it out
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
Ain't nobody love me this good
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
And I know, I know nobody could
Tell me who could give me this freedom
Tell me who could get me this far
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
And I know, I know nobody could
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Nobody could pull me from the darkness
Save me by the blood
Raise me from the ashes
I know, I know nobody could
Break off every shackle
And tear down every wall
And set free every captive
I know, I know nobody could
Pull me from the darkness
Save me by the blood
Raise me from the ashes
I know, I know nobody could
Break off every shackle
And tear down every wall
And set free every captive
I know, I know nobody could
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
Ain't nobody love me this good
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
And I know, I know nobody could
Tell me who could give me this freedom
Tell me who could get me this far
Ain't nobody love me like Jesus
And I know, I know nobody could
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
I know, I know nobody could
I know, I know nobody could
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
