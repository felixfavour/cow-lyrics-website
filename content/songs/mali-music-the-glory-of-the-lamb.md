I don't know if it's just me,
But I found it profoundly important,
That quickly, we'll see and realize, how we've become insubordinate,
Mouths to praise, hands to wave, feet to dance, souls to save
If we can return to a place of worship everything will be okay.
And we'll sing songs to the Glory of the Lamb
Let us sing songs to the Glory of the Lamb
And we'll sing songs to the Glory of the Lamb
Hallelujah Glory to the Lamb yeah.
Contrary to popular belief,
We were all conceived and brought forth with purpose,
And that's to worship,
And the enemy knows if we ever get back there
We will obtain the power to hurt him (hurt him),
So I encourage you my brothers and sisters
To get back to the threshing floor,
Cuz judgment's coming
And all the brokenness, hurt, and pain
No it won't hurt no more (won't hurt no more)
And we'll sing songs to the Glory of the Lamb
Let us sing songs to the Glory of the Lamb
And we'll sing songs to the Glory of the Lamb
Hallelujah Glory to the Lamb yeah.
To The Lamb
The Lamb
The Lamb,
Hallelujah Glory to The Lamb.
Let us go back worship And we'll sing songs to the Glory of the Lamb
Let us sing songs to the Glory of the Lamb
And we'll sing songs to the Glory of the Lamb
Hallelujah Glory to the Lamb yeah.
