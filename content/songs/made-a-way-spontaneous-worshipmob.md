You cause chains to break
You cause chains to break
You cause chains to break
You cause chains to break

(You're a chain breaker, chain breaker)
You cause chains to break
(You're a chain breaker, chain breaker)
You cause chains to break
(You're a chain breaker, chain breaker)
You cause chains to break
(Yes You do, God, You cause chains to break)
Chain breaker (Chain breaker)
He's a chain breaker (Chain breaker)
He's a chain breaker (Chain breaker)
He's a chain breaker (Chain breaker)
He's a chain breaker (Chain breaker)
He's a chain breaker (Chain breaker)
He's a chain breaker (Chain breaker)
You move mountains
You cause walls to fall
With Your power
You perform miracles
There is nothing that's impossible
So we're standing here
Only because You made
And we're standing here
Only because You made
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way
