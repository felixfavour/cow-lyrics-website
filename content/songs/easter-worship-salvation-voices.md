WORSHIP

Above all powers
Above all kings
Above all nature
And all created things
Above all wisdom
And all the ways of man
You were here
Before the world began
Above all kingdoms
Above all thrones
Above all wonders
The world has ever known
Above all wealth
And treasures of the earth
There's no way to measure
What You're worth

Crucified
Laid behind the stone
You lived to die
Rejected and alone
Like a rose
Trampled on the ground
You took the fall
And thought of me
Above all

You reign
You Ancient Zion's King
Kadosh Kadosh
You are mighty on your throne

You are mighty on your throne
You are mighty on your throne
You are mighty on your throne
You are mighty on your throne
You are mighty on your throne
You are mighty on your throne
You are mighty on your throne
You are mighty on your throne

PRAISE 

I'm trading my sorrows
I'm trading my shame
I'm laying them down
For the joy of the Lord
I'm trading my sickness
I'm trading my pain
I'm laying them down
For the joy of the Lord
We Say
Yes Lord yes Lord
Yes yes Lord
Yes Lord yes Lord
Yes yes Lord
Yes Lord yes Lord
Yes yes Lord Amen

I am pressed but not crushed
Persecuted not abandoned
Struck down but not destroyed

I am blessed beyond the curse
For His promise will endure
That His joy's gonna be my strength

Though the sorrow may last for the night
His joy comes with the morning


WORSHIP 

Your love is kind
Your love is patient
You fill my heart
With so much peace and joy
You're amazing
You make my life feel brand new
Jesus you're amazing
You make my life feel brand new, eh
Jesus, You love me too much o
Too much o, too much o
Excess love o
Say, Jesus, You love me too much o
Too much o, too much o
Excess love o

In Christ alone, my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song
This Cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease
My Comforter, my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

OFFERING

Jehovah Shamah

You are my Adonai
I give you Glory Honour Power Majesty
You are my Lord
Forever More
