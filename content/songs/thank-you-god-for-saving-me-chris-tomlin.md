What can I give to you?
What can I offer to the king?
For all the love you've shown
For all your mercy over me
I called your name, you heard my cry
Out of the grave, and into life
My heart is yours, my soul is free
Thank you God for saving me
Thank you God for saving me
The Rock of Salvation
My hope is built on nothing less
Morning by morning
How great is your faithfulness
I called your name, you heard my cry
Out of the grave, and into life
My heart is yours, my soul is free
Thank you God for saving me
Thank you God for saving me
Thank you God for saving me
