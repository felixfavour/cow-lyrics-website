Anko iheom’ine mere' mo
(If I start to talk of the good things you do for me)

Chi ge ji
(The sun will set)
Chi ga bo
(The sun will dawn)

When I think of the things You have done
And the works of Your hands
They are too marvellous for words
Too marvellous for thoughts o eh eh

But that's how great You are
Awesome Creator oh oh oh oh oh

So if you've seen the goodness of the Lord
Join us sing this song to Him e yeah eh eh eh

Anyi gienye gi ekele
(We will give you praise)
Chi dub’anyi o
(The God who leads us)

Anyi gienye gi ekele
(We will give you praise)
Onye nw’anyi
(The God who owns our lives)

Manko iheom’ine mere mo
Chi ge ji
Chi ga bo

When I think of the things you have done
And the works of Your hands

They are too marvellous for words
Too marvellous for thoughts

But that's how great You are
Awesome Creator
So if you've seen the goodness of the Lord
Join me sing this song to Him
