In the morning when the mercies are new
In the evening when the day is done
And in the middle when my soul needs reminding
You're still good, You're so good
In the waiting when my heart is confused
And the trusting when my hope feels lost
And in the harvest when I'm holding the promise
You're still good, You're so good
After all of these years
You're still good
You're so good
After all of these years
You're still good
You're so good
In the morning when the mercies are new
In the evening when the day is done
And in the middle when my soul needs reminding
You're still good, You're so good
All of these years
You're still good
You're so good
After all of these years
You're still good
You're so good
After all of these years
You're still good
You're so good
After all of these years
You're still good
You're so good
From generation to generation
There's no boundaries to His greatness
No eyes have seen
Ear has heard
You're not done yet
From generation to generation
There's no boundaries to His greatness
No eyes have seen
Ear has heard
You're not done yet
From generation to generation
There's no boundaries to His greatness
No eyes have seen
Ear has heard
You're not done yet
From generation to generation
There's no boundaries to His greatness
No eyes have seen
Ear has heard
You're not done yet
From generation to generation
There's no boundaries to His greatness
No eyes have seen
Ear has heard
You're not done yet
From generation to generation
There's no boundaries to His greatness
No eyes have seen
Ear has heard
You're not done yet
From generation to generation
There's no boundaries to His greatness
No eyes have seen
Ear has heard
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
You're not done yet
'Cause after all of these years
You're still good
(You're so good)
(After all of these years)
(You're still good)
(You're so good)
You're still good
You're so good
You're still good
You're so good
You're still good
You're so good
You're still good
You're so good
