When the first light brightened the dark
Before the breaking of the human heart
There was You and there was me
Innocence was all I knew
'Cause all I had to know was You
We were running underneath the trees
I wanna see You face to face
Where being in Your arms
Is the permanent state
I want it like it was back then
I wanna be in Eden
I remember how You called my name
And I would meet You at the garden gate
How the glory of Your love would shine
And I remember when the stars were young
You breathed life into my lungs
Oh, I never felt so alive
I wanna see You face to face
Where being in Your arms
Is the permanent state
I want it like it was back then
I wanna be in Eden
To be naked and unashamed
In a sweet downpour of innocent rain
I want it like it was back then
I wanna be in Eden
