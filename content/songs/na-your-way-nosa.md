You still heal the sick
You still raise the dead
You still do amazing things
Na your way
Na your way
You still hear our prayers
You still answer when we call
You always keep your promise
Na your way
Na your way
Chorus:
Na your way, Na your way, Na your way
Na your way, Na your way, Na your way
You're still moving mountains
With your great and outstretched hands
You still do impossible things
Na your way
Na your way
You never lost a battle
You have never known defeat
And you handed us your victory
Na your way
Na your way
