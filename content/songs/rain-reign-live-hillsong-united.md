You fall like rain
In fire and thunder
The mountains melt
Like wax before You
Your kingdom reigns
In everlasting grace and wonder
Your love making all things new
Your love making everything beautiful
My God
Making all things new
Everything turning
From ruin to life in You
Making all things new
Everything turning to something so beautiful
Your goodness
Your mercy
Your promise crashing down like rain
Your kingdom
Your glory
Your presence breaking out like rain
In fire and thunder
The mountains melt
Like wax before You
Your kingdom reigns
In everlasting grace and wonder
Your love making all things new
Your love making everything beautiful
