In Christ alone my hope is found;
He is my light, my strength, my song;
This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all—
Here in the love of Christ I stand
In Christ alone, Who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied;
For ev’ry sin on Him was laid—
Here in the death of Christ I live
There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain;
Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory
Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me;
For I am His and He is mine—
Bought with the precious blood of Christ
