God You make me smile as I look to You
And I never thought life could be so cool
I'm so free to be me
We're a generation who will live for You
Nothing's gonna stop us from loving You
We believe in Jesus
Pre-Chorus:
Life is fun, and I'm so happy You're my friend and King
Chorus:
I raise my hands to praise Your Name
I am not ashamed, praise Your Name, Jesus
God You make me smile as I look to You
And I never thought life could be so cool
I'm so free to be me
We're a generation who will live for You
Nothing's gonna stop us from loving You
We believe in Jesus
Pre-Chorus:
Life is fun, and I'm so happy You're my friend and King
Chorus:
I raise my hands to praise Your Name
I am not ashamed, praise Your Name, Jesus
