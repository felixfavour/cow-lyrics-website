One Church, one Faith, one Anthem raised
God and God alone
One Cross, one Grace, one Name that saves
All praise to You belongs
All praise to You belongs
We lift You higher, higher, God and God alone
Your Name be louder, louder, than any other song
You are forever seated on Your throne
You are forever God and God alone
Who else can wash our sin away?
God and God alone
Who else can raise us from the grave?
All praise to You belongs
Jesus, all praise to You belongs
We lift You higher, higher, God and God alone
Your Name be louder, louder, than any other song
You are forever seated on Your throne
You are forever God and God alone
