I have seen the lord′s goodness
His mercies and compassion
I have seen the Lord's goodness
Halleluya praise the Lord

O Lord you have been so good
You are so good to me
O Lord you are excellent
In my life everyday
O Lord you have been so good
You are so good to me
O Lord you are excellent
In my life

I will call upon the Lord (I will call upon the Lord)
For he is worthy to be praised (for He is worthy to be praised)
I will call upon the Lord (I will call upon the Lord)
For He is worthy to be praised (for He is worthy to be praised)
So shall I be saved from my enemies

The Lord reigneth
Blessed be the Rock
And let the Rock of my salvation be exalted

The Lord reigneth
Blessed be the Rock
And let the Rock of my salvation be exalted

My God reigneth let the earth tremble (He reigneth let the earth tremble)

Emi ‘ba n‘egberun ahon,

Abi ko seun fun mi ( Ah o ma seun fun mi)
Abi ko da o late (Ah o ma damilare)
