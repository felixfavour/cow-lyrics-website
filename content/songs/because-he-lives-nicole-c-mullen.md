Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone;
Because I know He holds My future
And life is worth the living
Just because He lives!
Oh yeah yeah, I can face it yeah
Oh thank you Jesus
All My fear is gone
Because I know yeah I know He holds My future
So My life is worth, it's worth the living
Just Because He lives!
My life is worth the living
It's worth the living
Just because He lives!
