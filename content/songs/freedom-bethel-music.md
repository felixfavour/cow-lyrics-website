You came to set the captives free
You came to bring us liberty
My sin and my rejection
Your blood and my acceptance
Now I'm alive to bring You praise
Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Every chain is broken through You, Jesus
'Cause where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Your blood has covered every sin
Your grace empowers me to win
My pain and my oppression met
Your blood and my acceptance
Now I'm alive to bring You praise
Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Every chain is broken through You, Jesus
'Cause where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
