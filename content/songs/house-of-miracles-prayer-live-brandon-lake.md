[Spoken: Brandon Lake]
Amen
While we're in this moment, um
God has taught me a lot about miracles
And that He is still moving, and still healing, and still resurrecting
And I didn't want this moment to pass by and not take this opportunity
And so I've invited my friend Joshua Silverberg up to the stage and
I want him to pray over us
Whether you're here in the room or you're listening
I believe that God's gonna heal so many people
And this is gonna happen years and years to come as people watch this
You're gonna be healed
And you're listening to this maybe even in your room
And you're gonna be set free and you're gonna be healed
And we even have a testimony, um
Joshua's become a great friend, and, uh
How I, I met you was through Micah back here playing guitar
Absolutely slaying it
But Micah had a disease for about four or five years that they couldn't figure out what it was
And he'd be, I remember, bro, like, just
You being laid, like, laid out on the floor, just like
I remember you telling me, like, "I don't know if I'm gonna wake up tomorrow"And we prayed over Micah what seemed like a million times, you know?
And all of a sudden this stranger, but brother in Christ, calls Micah on the phone
And in a matter of minutes and continuing to pray
Something broke and electricity hit Micah in the top of the head
And went through his body and completely delivered him from that disease
So that testimony is in the room and that testimony is going out right now
So I've asked Josh to come and pray for us
As we have this holy moment where people are gonna be healed, delivered, and set free
