1: This is the time to think,
Make haste to everlasting life.
Chorus: The last ship has arrived,
Jesus calleth sinners,
The last ship has arrived,
Jesus calleth sinners,
Those people with doubtful mind,
They will land upon empty harbour,
Witches cannot board the ship,
They will land upon empty harbour,
Wizards cannot board the ship,
They will land upon empty harbour.

2: Vanity is this world,
And all they that dwell therein:
Chorus: The last ship has arrived,
Jesus calleth sinners,
The last ship has arrived,
Jesus calleth sinners,
Those people with doubtful mind,
They will land upon empty harbour,
Witches cannot board the ship,
They will land upon empty harbour,
Wizards cannot board the ship,
They will land upon empty harbour.

3: Holy, Holy, Holy,
Is not for this world alone:
Chorus: The last ship has arrived,
Jesus calleth sinners,
The last ship has arrived,
Jesus calleth sinners,
Those people with doubtful mind,
They will land upon empty harbour,
Witches cannot board the ship,
They will land upon empty harbour,
Wizards cannot board the ship,
They will land upon empty harbour.

4: The hour now has come,
Labour for Holy Fatherâ€™s wishes:
Chorus: The last ship has arrived,
Jesus calleth sinners,
The last ship has arrived,
Jesus calleth sinners,
Those people with doubtful mind,
They will land upon empty harbour,
Witches cannot board the ship,
They will land upon empty harbour,
Wizards cannot board the ship,
They will land upon empty harbour.
Amen
