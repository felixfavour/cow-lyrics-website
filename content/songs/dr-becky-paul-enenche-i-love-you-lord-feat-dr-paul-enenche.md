Oh Lord my God
You first loved me
Even yet in the world
you made your plans for me
I love you Lord
I love you Lord
You mean so much to me
So much to me
I love you Lord
I love you Lord
I love you Lord
You mean so much to me
So much to me
I love you Lord
Where can I go
Where would I be
Where can i be now
Without your Love
I love you Lord (I love you Lord)
I love you Lord (I love you Lord)
You mean so much to me
So much to me
I love you Lord
I love you Lord (I love you Lord)
I love you Lord (I love you Lord)
You mean so much to me
So much to me
I love you Lord (I love you Lord)
I can't trade you Lord
For riches or Gold
Am alive not today
Just because of you
I love you Lord (I love you Lord)
I love you Lord (I love you Lord)
You mean so much to me
So much to me
I love you Lord
I love you Lord (I love you Lord)
I love you Lord (I love you Lord)
You mean so much to me
So much to me
I love you Lord (I love you Lord)
I love you Lord
I love you Lord
You mean so much to me
So much to me

You mean so much to me
So much to me
