You don't ask for perfection
So I won't even bother pretending
I've been known from the start
Holding secrets is heavy
So I'll tell You them all, Lord, I'm ready
Here's my heart, opened up
Honesty, You want honesty
Not just part of me, You want everything
So all of me, I'll bring You all of me
No more hide-and-seek, Jesus, I'm coming clean
You're the One I won't question
When my mind runs a million directions
You're the friend I can trust
Here I am, Lord, surrеndered
With my hands lifted high, I'll rеmember
That I'm safe with You, God
And there's no fear in Your love
Honesty, You want honesty
Not just part of me, You want everything
So all of me, I'll bring You all of me
No more hide-and-seek, Jesus, I'm coming clean
