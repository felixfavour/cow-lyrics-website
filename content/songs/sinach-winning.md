"Sounds"
Through the fire, through the storm
I will stand in your word
Through the fire, through the storm
I will stand in your word
Jesus my victory, Jesus my song
You are my victory, you are my song
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Through the fire, through the storm
I will stand in your word
Through the fire, through the storm
I will stand in your word
Jesus my victory, Jesus my song
You are my victory, you are my song
Jesus my victory, Jesus my song
You are my victory, you are my song
I have overcome, I am winning everyday
I have overcome, I am winning everyday
I have overcome, I am winning everyday
I have overcome, I am winning everyday
I have overcome, I am winning everyday
I have overcome, I am winning everyday
I have overcome, I am winning everyday
I have overcome, I am winning everyday
I'm winning, winning, winning, I'm winning
I'm winning, winning, winning, I'm winning
I'm winning, winning, winning, I'm winning
I'm winning, winning, winning, I'm winning
(Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday)
