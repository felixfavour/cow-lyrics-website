ce upon a time
I wake up in the morning with a smile on my face
I wanna touch the sky
Do I really know the reason why
I wanna be all I can be
Singing internationally
I want the whole world to hear me
Won't you let me please
I will rise
Above the storm
And above the norm
Till my eyes
See the place
Within the grace
I'm gonna get better better better
Rising higher higher higher
I'm gonna sail out far
I no go tire
I no go tire o iyo
O o iyo o o o o iyo o
O o iyo o o o o iyo o
See if it cannot hurt me it only make me stronger
When you see me make you startle make you wonder
Whether I slept 
It's because my eyes are fixed the way up yonder
I will rise
Above the storm
And above the norm
Till my eyes
See the place
Within the grace
I'm gonna get better better better
Rising higher higher higher
I'm gonna sail out far
I no go tire
I no go tire o iyo
O o iyo o o o o iyo o
O o iyo o o o o iyo o
Won wa nbere mi lere
Kini mose njere
Won wa suru bomi duro demi
Waiting on me now
Won wa nbere mi lere
Kini mose njere
Won wa suru bomi duro demi
Waiting on me now
See if it cannot hurt me it only make me stronger
When you see me make you startle make you wonder
Whether I slept 
It's because my eyes are fixed the way up yonder
I will rise
Above the storm
And above the norm
Till my eyes
See the place
Within the grace
I will rise
Above the storm
And above the norm
Till my eyes
See the place
Within the grace
I will rise
Above the storm
And above the norm
Till my eyes
See the place
Within the grace
I will rise
Above the storm
And above the norm
Till my eyes
See the place
Within the grace
I will rise
Above the storm
And above the norm
Till my eyes
See the place
Within the grace
Still I'll rise
