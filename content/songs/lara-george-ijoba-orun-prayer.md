is well with you
You will live
You will not die
You will live to declare the glory of the Lord
In the land of the living
See the Devil is a liar
No weapon formed against you will prosper
And you are blessed in the name of Jesus
In your rising up and in your setting down
In your coming in and in your going out
You will be all that God has called you to be
Fulfilling your destiny
