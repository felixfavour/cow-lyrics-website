h aiii
eeeeee
oh aii eeee
i love you Jesus
the devil is a liar
he tld me there was no way i could
go through the tough time storms and trials
so i never thought i woud make it through
to walk in my inheritance
and in my liberty in Christ
but God has pushed aside
the scales that were in my eyes
now i understand God has set before me
set before me open doors
he's given me the keys
so i don't have to knock on doors
situations around me
they make me wanna shout and doubt
they make me wanna give up on the hope i found i God's word
and believe there is no way out
my folks arent helping matter
they just dont understand
how i just keep shining in the midst of the dark
that surounds me but me i know the answer
God has set before God has set before me
set before me open doors
he's given me the keys
so i don't have to knock on doors
God has set before me
set before me open doors
he's given me the keys
so i don't have to knock on doors
though things may seem contrary
God's word will still transpire
see those who don't believe me
God be true be true and every man a liar
God has set before God has set before me
set before me open doors
he's given me the keys
so i can have an open door
God has set before me
set before me open doors
he's given me the keys
so i don't have to knock on doors
God has set before me
set before me open doors
he's given me the keys
so i don't have to knock on doors
God has set before me
set before me open doors
he's given me the keys
so i don't have to knock on doors
God has set before me
set before me open doors
he's given me the keys
so i don't have to knock on doors
