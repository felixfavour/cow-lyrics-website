I'm walking on with Jesus, and I'm holding to his hanf. I'm walking on with Jesus, through this dark and sinful land and though the battle rages, up ahead and I can't see. I won't look back to the left or right, cause I know He walks with me. 

One day my Jesus walked the shores of Galilee. There two men there fishing; casting nets into the sea. They didn't know any moment, what a change there would be. When Jesus said leave your nets, come and follow me. 

And they went walking on with Jesus and holding to His hand walking on with Hesus, through a dark and sinful land. And though the battle rages, up ahead and I can't see, I won't look back to the left or right, cause I know He walks with me. 

Well I'm walking on with Jesus for I know He'll giude my way and I'm walking on with Jesus, 'til I reach that brighter day. And though my feet grow weary, and I stumble in the road. He'll pick me up, dust me off, and help me carry my load. 

I'm walking on with Jesus, and I'm holding to his hanf. I'm walking on with Jesus, through this dark and sinful land and though the battle rages, up ahead and I can't see. I won't look back to the left or right, cause I know He walks with me. 

I'm walking on to Zion, where I know all sorrows flee. I'm gonna walk right into Glory, where my Jesus I shall see, and when I see the Father, oh how happy I will be, when Jesus says; that's my child, and they have followed me. 

I'm walking on with Jesus, and I'm holding to his hanf. I'm walking on with Jesus, through this dark and sinful land and though the battle rages, up ahead and I can't see. I won't look back to the left or right, cause I know He walks with me. 

One day I'm gonna walk, that golden highway built for me. It may go right through the desert friend, but that's alright you see. Cause it will be blooming like a rose, with the water's running free. Where the blind will see, the deaf will hear, and the lame will walk with me. 

I'm walking on with Jesus, and I'm holding to his hanf. I'm walking on with Jesus, through this dark and sinful land and though the battle rages, up ahead and I can't see. I won't look back to the left or right, cause I know He walks with me.
