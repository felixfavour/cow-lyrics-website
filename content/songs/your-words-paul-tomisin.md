Once have You spoken
Twice have I heard
Thrice I would do, all of your words
Your Words I have heard
Your Words I will do
Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh
Your Words, Your Word, Your Word, Your Word
Your word is Jesus, Your word is Truth
Your Word, Your Word, Your Word,Your Word oooo
Your Word is Jesus, Your Word is Light
Shines upon my feet, Your word lightens up my part
Your words are Spirit, Spirit and Life
Your words are yeeeeeeeeaaa, yea and Amen
Your word is Jesus
Entirety of the truth
Your word is Life, Life unto my soul
Your word was with men
And Your words was God
Your words I live
Your word makes me
Yahweh! Yahweh! Yahweh!
