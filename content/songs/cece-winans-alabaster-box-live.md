The room grew still as she made her way to Jesus
She stumbles through the tears that made her blind
She felt such pain, some spoke in anger
Heard folks whisper, "there's no place here for her kind"
Still on she came through the shame that flushed her face
Until at last, she knelt before His feet
And though she spoke no words, everything she said was heard
As she poured her love for the Master, from her box of alabaster
So I've come to pour my praise on Him
Like oil from Mary's alabaster box
So don't be angry if I wash His feet with my tears
And I dry them with my hair, hmm
'Cause you weren't there the night He found me
You did not feel what I felt
When He wrapped His love all around me and
You don't know the cost, not of this oil
In my alabaster box
No one knows what you've been through
I can't forget the way life used to be
'Cause I was a prisoner to the sin that had me bound
And I spent my days, poured my life without measure
Into a little treasure box I'd thought I'd found
ooh
Until the day when Jesus came to me
And healed my soul with the wonder of His touch
So now I'm giving back to Him
all all the praise He's worthy of
I've been forgiven and that's why
I love Him so much
So I've come to pour my praise on Him
Like oil from Mary's alabaster box (Mary's alabaster box)
So don't be angry if I wash His feet with my tears
And dry them with my hair
You weren't there the night Jesus found me
You did not feel what I felt
When He wrapped His loving arms around me and
You don't know the, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know (Jesus was there)
You don't know the, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know the cost of the oil
In my alabaster box (oh)
Come on let's worship Him
Come on and give Him the glory (hallelujah)
.....
mmm
