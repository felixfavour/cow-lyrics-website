So here it is, my alabaster heart
I'm keeping nothing back from who You are
No hidden treasure veiled by key or lock
You’re a lifetime worth of worship and that's only just the start
And here it is, my every waking day
The minutes, hours, the years of endless praise
For You're worthy far beyond all I could say
There’s a lifetime worth of worship in the nuance of Your names
So let it rise like incense
My whole life, a fragrance
Every ounce here broken at Your feet
Every breath, an offering
My heart cries, these lungs sing over You
My worthy King of kings
There it is, Your alabaster cross
Giving all You are for all I'm not
I can't believe that's the kind of King You are
How could I not bring a lifetime worth of worship to You, God?
