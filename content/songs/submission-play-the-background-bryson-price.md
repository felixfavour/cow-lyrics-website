[Intro: Elevation Worship]
Your will be done
Your, Your will be done
Your will be done
Your kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as it is, in Heaven
For Yours is the Kingdom
Power and glory
Forever You reign
Forever You reign
So let hope, swell in our lives
So let hope, swell in our lives
We will be the Church, to live out Your heart
Take heart, for You have overcome the world
May Your Kingdom come
[Hook: Skrillex]
You gotta believe there's something more
[Sample]
(I'm just like you... you don't need to hide... For I am just like you) (backwards x2)
Yes
So let me just shadow you, let me trace your lines
Matter of fact, just take my pen, here, you create my rhymes
Cause if I do this by myself, I'm scared that I'll succeed
And no longer trust in you, cause I only trust in me (me)
And see, that's how you end up headed to destruction
Paving a road to nowhere, pour your life out for nothing
You pulled my card, I'm bluffing, You know what's in my hand
Me, I'm just going to trust you, You cause the dice to land
I'm in control of nothing, follow you at any cost
Some call it sovereign will, all I know is you the boss
Man, I'm so at ease, I'm so content
I'll play the background-d-d-d-d-d
