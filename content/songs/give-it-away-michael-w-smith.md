She asked him for forever
And a promise that would last
He said, "Babe, you know I love you
But I can't commit to that"She said, "Love isn't love
Till You give it away"A father lived in silence
Saw his son become a man
There was a distance felt between them
'Cause he could not understand
That love isn't love
Till you give it away
You gotta give it away
As we live
Moving side by side
May we learn to give
(May we learn to give)
Learn to sacrifice
We can entertain compassion
For a world in need of care
But the road of good intentions
Doesn't lead to anywhere
'Cause love isn't love
Till you give it away, yeah
You gotta give it away
