Abba Father
I've come to the end of myself
Have Your Way
With my Eyes on You
And my Heart on You
Have Your Way
Hold me by the Hand
I Trust Your Will
Lord Have Your Way
Hold me by the Hand
I Trust Your Will
Lord Have Your Way
Abba Father
I've come to the end of myself
Have Your Way
With my Eyes on You
And my Heart on You
Have Your Way
Hold me by the Hand
I Trust Your Will
Lord Have Your Way
Hold me by the Hand
I Trust Your Will
Lord Have Your Way

Have Your Way
In my Live Lord
Have, Have Your Way
Have Your Way
In my Live Lord
Have, Have Your Way
Have Your Way
In my Live Lord
Have, Have Your Way
Have Your Way
In my Live Lord
Have, Have Your Way
There is a Difference
Between Saying Yes
And Living Yes
I'll be your Living Yes
There is a Difference
Between Saying I Surrender
And Living Surrendered
I'll be your Living Sacrifice
So I Rest in Your Will
And I Rest in Your Word
I Rest in Your Strength
Your Ability, Have Your Way
And I Rest in Your Will
I Rest in Your Strength
I Rest in Your Word
Your Ability, Have Your Way

Have Your Way
In my Live Lord
Have, Have Your Way
Have Your Way
In my Live Lord
Have, Have Your Way
Have Your Way
In my Live Lord
Have, Have Your Way
Have Your Way
In my Live Lord
Have, Have Your Way
Have Your Way
In my Live Lord
Have, Have Your Way
Have Your Way
In my Live Lord
Have, Have Your Way
