[Hook: Tasha Cobbs]
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
Exalt my life, it's hell within
Called on Christ, and fail again
All my life I've dwelled in sin
Causin' strife, my flare was dim
Was lost in life, my prayers was then
To floss my ice and hail revenge
To ball like Mike and V12 a Benz
Turn off the lights and nail ya friends
But you fall from heights when the ledge is thin
When you called to fight but you scared to win
When they've marked a price on ya head for 10
And you callin' Christ cause you dread the grim
Cause it's all goodnight if you pledge with Him
You then lost ya sight, better tread and swim
Them sharks will bite, shred ya limbs
Gemstones for life, this is prayer through hymns
[Hook: Tasha Cobbs]
There's an army rising up
There's an army rising up
There's an army rising up
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
