Lord You are good
You've been so good
Lord You are good
You've been better than good
I can't You praise enough
I owe You my life
Can't praise You enough
Even If I tried
Cos You've been, so good
Lift your voice ('cause You've been so good)
Come on tell him today, You've been so good to me
(Hook)
So many doors (so many doors You've opened)
So many ways (so many ways You've made)
So many times (so many times You've healed me)
You've been better than good to me (You've been better than good to me)
You've been better than good to me (You've been better than good to me)
I can never repay You Lord
I can never repay You Lord
I can never repay You Lord
For what You've done for me
How You loose my shackles and
How You set me free
How You made a way
Where there was no way
How You made a way
Where there was no way
How You made a way
Where there was no way, oh God
You made a way
Cause You've been, so good
You've been, so good
You've been, so good
You've been, so good
When I almost lost my mind You've been, so good
You've been, so good
You've been, so good to me (to me)
You've been better than good to me
You've been better than good to me
You've been better than good to me
You've been better than good to me
Oh You've been better than
Oh You've been better
You've been
You've been
