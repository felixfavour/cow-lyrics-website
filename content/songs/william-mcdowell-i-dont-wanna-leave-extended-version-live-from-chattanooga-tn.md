We've been waiting for this moment
Now we're standing in Your presence, Jesus
Gazing into eyes like fire
You're the only One that matters now
And all our fears are swept away
As we see you face to face
Surrounded by Your love
I found a place of peace
I found a place of praise
Wrapped in Your embrace
And I don't wanna leave
Here in Your presence
Such a sweet release
I can feel Your joy
Rushing over me
And I don't wanna leave
Only You can satisfy us
So we bow to give You worship, Jesus
Holy
Holy
You're the only One that matters now
And all our fears are swept away
As we see you face to face
I'm surrounded by Your love
I found a place of peace
I found a place of praise
Wrapped in Your embrace
And I don't wanna leave
Here in Your presence
Such a sweet release
I can feel Your joy rushing over me
And I don't wanna leave
I'm surrounded by Your love
I found a place of peace
I found a place of praise
Wrapped in Your embrace
And I don't wanna leave
Here in Your presence
Such a sweet release
I can feel Your joy rushing over me
And I don't wanna leave
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna leave
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna leave
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna leave
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna leave
I'm surrounded by Your love
I found a place of peace
I found a place of praise
Wrapped in Your embrace
And I don't wanna leave
Here in Your presence
Such a sweet release
I can feel Your joy rushing over me
And I don't wanna leave
I'm surrounded by Your love
I found a place of peace
I found a place of praise
Wrapped in Your embrace
And I don't wanna leave
Here in Your presence
Such a sweet release
I can feel Your joy rushing over me
And I don't wanna leave
