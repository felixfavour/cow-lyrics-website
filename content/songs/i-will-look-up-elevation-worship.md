All the worries of this world
I will lay them at Your feet
Surrender every anxious thought
For perfect peace, Your perfect peace
All the loved ones I hold dear
All my hopes and dreams and all my fears
I will choose to trust Your name
In everything, with everything
I will look up for there is none above You
I will bow down to tell you that I need You
Jesus, Lord of all
Jesus, Lord of all
I will take You at Your Word
For Jesus, You have taken hold of me
All my life is in Your hands
You are my strength, You are my strength
I will look up for there is none above You
I will bow down to tell you that I need You
Jesus, Lord of all
Jesus, Lord of all
