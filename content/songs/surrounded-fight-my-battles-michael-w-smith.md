[Intro]
The word says
"For the spirit of heaviness
Put on the garment of praise"That's how we fight our battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles...
This is how I fight my battles
