More than my mouth can testify
More than my mind can comprehend
See I've seen the orders of your gace
I'm so sure that, this is not the end
Oh oh
Eze Ebube
See how far you've brought me
Eze Ebube
I'm so glad you found me worthy
I can see
I can tell
And I know
It's your grace, all my days
I will sing your praise
My heart is full of gratitude
To you and no one else but you
Lord, I'm here
Only by your grace
Thank you, Jesus, for not giving up on me.
Grace found me
Grace saves me
Grace made me, who I am
Grace redeem me
Grace Jesustains me
Grace made me, who I am
I can see, I can tell
And I know, it's your grace,
All my days, I will sing your praise
