Speak it to me Lord Jesus me need to hear from you
If you don't speak Lord Jesus me don't know what to do
Speak it to me Lord Jesus me need to hear from you
If you don't speak Lord Jesus me don't know what to do

If I could touch the hymm of his garment my life would be complete
Speak it to me Lord Jesus me need to hear from you
