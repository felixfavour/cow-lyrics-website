You've been tryin' hard to bear the weight of all your shame
And if there's a God up there, you're sure He forgot your name
When your steps are getting heavy, and hope looks all but lost
Just bring it all to the cross
Who told you grace can't reach the messed up ones like you?
Has the devil made you believe the lies he tells are true?
When you're sure that you'rе the one who's wanderеd too far off
It's not too late
Just come home to the cross
[Chorus: Anne Wilson]
Come and see a Savior's love that would die to make you new
Nothing you have ever done, can change what mercy's done for you
And if you ever wonder if you're worth so great a cost
Look up and see the cross
Everybody's got a list at least a mile long
Of every scar and every sin from everywhere that we've gone wrong
But there's reason for rejoicin', and the reason is because
That list 
was nailed to the cross
[Chorus: Anne Wilson, 
Chris Tomlin
, 
Chris Tomlin & Anne Wilson
]
Come and see a Savior's love that would die to make you new
Nothing you have ever done, can change what mercy's done for you (
What mercy's done
)
And if you ever wonder if you're worth so great a cost
Look up and see the cross
Oh, the cross
