We fall down
We lay our crowns
At the feet of Jesus
The greatness of
The mercy and love
At the feet of Jesus
And we cry, "Holy, holy, holy"We cry, "Holy, holy, holy"We cry, "Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lambâ€
We fall down
We lay our crown
At the feet of Jesus
The greatness of
The mercy and love
At the feet of Jesus
And we cry, "Holy, holy, holy"And we cry, "Holy, holy, holy"And we cry, "Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lambâ€
And we cry, "Holy, holy, holy"We cry, "Holy, holy, holy"We cry, "Holy, holy, holy
Is the Lambâ€
