Intro
Have been crying for way to long
Have decide the praise belong to you
Oh my lord
Oh my lord
Cos today Is the you've made
I will rejoice again and say is true

Oh my lord
The enemy came to steal but you gave me life
And I won't let him what he did not give
Ah ah ah
Am getting my song back
Ahhh ah ah
Am getting taking joy back
I found  my peace in the presence of god
I found my strength in the presence of God
All I need is found in the presence of God
