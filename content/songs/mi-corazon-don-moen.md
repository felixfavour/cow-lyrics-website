My heart is filled with songs of praise
You gave me hope, You made a way
Now I long to live in your presence
For all of my days
My soul sings, my spirit shouts
With every breath i'm crying out
I want to live for You alone
You have captured my heart, Mi corazón
Amazing grace has rescued me
You paid the price, You set me free
I will sing Your praises forever
My Savior and King
I will give You glory
Tell the wondrous story
How You rescued me
I'm the guilty one
But You sacrificed Your Son
Your One and Only
Now I stand before You blameless and Holy
