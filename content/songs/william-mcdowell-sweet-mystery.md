Lead us to Your heart
We wanna be where You are
Take us to a place
Where all we see is You
Lead us to Your heart
We wanna be where You are
Take us to a place
Where all we see is You
Falling on our knees
Bowing down in worship
Fear is swept away
As You draw us close
Close enough to see Your face
And be lost in Your embrace
In Your presence we are changed
And we'll never be the same
Close enough to see Your face
And be lost in Your embrace
In Your presence we are changed
And we'll never be the same
Grace, sweet mystery
Pursued us when we turned our backs on You
Yet with Your love You draw us closer
Closer to Your heart
Close enough to see Your face
(See Your face...)
And be lost in Your embrace
(Lost in Your embrace...)
In Your presence
We are changed
And we'll  never be the same
Grace! Sweet mystery
Pursued us when we turned our backs on You
Yet with Your love You draw us closer
Closer to Your-
Grace! sweet mystery
Pursued us when we turned our backs on You
Yet with Your love You draw us closer
Closer to Your heart
Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord
Pull us closer
You're pulling us closer
Closer to Your heart
Closer to Your-
Heart
You're pulling us closer
(Moving us closer)
You're pulling us closer
(Moving us closer)
Closer to Your heart
(Closer to Your heart)
Closer to Your heart
(Closer to Your heart)
Pulling us closer
(Moving us closer)
Holding us closer
(Moving us closer)
Closer to Your heart
(Closer to Your heart)
Closer to Your heart
(Closer to Your heart)
With Your love You are
Pulling us closer
With Your mercy You are
Holding us closer
Everyday just a little bit
Closer to Your heart
Closer to Your-
Heart
Keep pulling us closer
Moving us closer
So much closer
Moving us closer
Closer to Your heart
