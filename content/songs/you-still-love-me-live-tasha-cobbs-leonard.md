Why do we do the things we do?
When it hurts you
I'll never understand why
We're at a place in our lives
Where we're tired of all the lies
And the pain we feel inside
[Pre Chorus]
We wanna make it right
I have nothing else to give except my life
Please accept this offering
I present my body, my sacrifice, holy
Yeah, yeah
I'm running back to You, with my hands lifted high
I give You my heart (Yeah)
And I give You my life (I don't mean)
I don't mean to be emotional (Oh)
But sometimes I cry (Yeah)
When I think of all the pain (That I caused You inside)
That I caused You inside (Aye)
[Post Chorus]
But You still love me (Oh)
Somebody put your hands on it right there
You still love me (Oh yeah)
