There is a fountain that never runs dry
Forever flows with water of life
You never stop moving
You never stop moving
Where Your river runs, everything lives
Where Your river goes will never thirst again
You never stop moving
You never stop moving
Your mercy flows like a wild, wild river
Your love is strong like the raging sea
God, all Your goodness goes beyond all measure
Your grace like a flood pouring out of me
You call me out to walk with You on the sea
Even in my doubt, deep calls to deep
You never stop moving
You never stop moving
Your mercy flows like a wild, wild river
Your love is strong like the raging sea
God, all Your goodness goes beyond all measure
Your grace like a flood pouring out of me
