"Now"
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I see a new beginning
The spirit of God is moving now
And yes, I hear restoration, oh oh oh
In the name of Jesus now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
There shall be a great performance
Every prophecy fulfilled
And I hear a mighty harvest now
In the name of Jesus now
For the Lord has spoken once
And we heard him twice
All the power and the glory belongs to him
We are filled with his spirit
And authority
So in the name of Jesus
The time is now
For the Lord has spoken once
And we heard him twice
All the power and the glory belongs to him
We are filled with his spirit
And authority
So in the name of Jesus
The time is now
For the Lord has spoken once
And we heard him twice
All the power and the glory belongs to him
We are filled with his spirit
And authority
So in the name of Jesus Christ
The time is
Now now now
The time is now now now
I take it now now now
In the name of Jesus
Now now now now
I see it, I take it
I see it, I take it
It's mine in the name of Jesus
Get your hands off my children
Get your hands off my family now, ha
Every tree harvest now
Every seed harvest now
Every dream come alive now
Now now
In the name of Jesus
Hey hey hey
In the name of Jesus now
Open wide wide gates coming through now
I receive it
We bouncing in victory now, we walking in the victory
I receive it now
Sing a new song of victory now, hey
In the name of Jesus
In the name come alive come alive come alive now
In the name of Jesus now
Hey hey hey...
For the Lord has spoken once
And we heard him twice
All the power and the glory belongs to him
We are filled with his spirit
And authority
So in the name of Jesus
The time is now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
