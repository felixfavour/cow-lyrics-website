I breathe You in, I breathe You in
Come fill me Holy Spirit with Your mighty rushing wind
I breathe You in, I breathe You in
When You come all of a sudden, I am strong again
I breathe You in, I breathe You in
Come fill me Holy Spirit with Your mighty rushing wind
I breathe You in, I breathe You in
When You come all of a sudden, I am strong again
Breathe on me, oh breath of God
Flood me with Your living water
Rush through me now 'til my soul overflows
Breathe on me, oh breath of God
Flood me with Your living water
Rush through me now 'til my soul overflows
I brеathe You in, I breathe You in
Comе fill me Holy Spirit with Your mighty rushing wind
I breathe You in, I breathe You in
When You come all of a sudden, I am strong again
Breathe on me, oh breath of God
Flood me with Your living water
Rush through me now 'til my soul overflows
Breathe on me, oh breath of God
Flood me with Your living water
Rush through me now 'til my soul overflows
Breathe on me, oh breath of God
Flood me with Your living water
Rush through me now 'til my soul overflows
Breathe on me, oh breath of God
Flood me with Your living water
Rush through me now 'til my soul overflows
