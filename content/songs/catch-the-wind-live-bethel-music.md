I am strong and full of life
I am steadfast, no compromise
I lift my sails, to the sky
I'm gonna catch the wind
I'm gonna catch the wind
I am bold, no fear inside
Spread my wings, open my life
Like an eagle, whose home is the sky
I'm gonna catch the wind
I'm gonna catch the wind
Your faithfulness will never let me down      
I'm confident I'll see Your goodness now      
I know You hear my heart, I'm singing out      
There's nothing that can stop Your goodness now
I am bold, no fear inside
Spread my wings, open my life
Like an eagle, whose home is the sky
I'm gonna catch the wind
I'm gonna catch the wind
