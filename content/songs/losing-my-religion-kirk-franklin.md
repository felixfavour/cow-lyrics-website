I’m losing my religion
Thank God!
I prayed about my decision
How odd
For the man with the mic
To be the man all his life
Rock Christ, like Stipe’s did with R.E.M
Rev up the RPMs
How do I begin to try to paint this sin
Of rules?
That divide God’s people in two.
In the beginning, religion created a mask
The reformation helped, but soon the patch didn't last.
I don’t tell, you don’t ask
So we created a lie
And for generations, church was where we went to go hide
Or we no longer tried
Because a rules read-out relationship is empty inside,
Leaves you bitter, dry
Swift to cut like a razor
Swift to call you a traitor
'Cause you swift to love Taylor
Now we got bad blood with our neighbor
Who’s wrong, who’s right?
Every Sunday we're divided
Who’s black, who’s white?
Shamone!!
