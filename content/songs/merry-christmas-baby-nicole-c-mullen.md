Merry Christmas, Baby
I wish that You were here
I've been hoping, praying maybe
I could give away my fear
Of being alone without You at home
How I miss You when we're apart
But I'll treasure it all, the grand and the small
Sweet memories are gifts to the heart
So, Merry Christmas, Baby
Merry Christmas, Baby
Merry Christmas with love
Ooh, yeah
Merry Christmas, Baby
Many long to see this day
Wish that I had more to give You
Than a stable and some hay
One look in Your eyes reassured me
That I am right where You wanted me
In the midst of this stall, the wonder of all
Is how grand something small can be
