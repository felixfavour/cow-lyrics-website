I choose to sing when I can hardly breathe out a breath
I choose to stand when all I wanted to is give up
I choose to trust when my whole world is fallin' apart
I choose You, Jesus
'Cause I still believe through it all
I still believe You are wonderful, and
You've never given up on me
You've never given up on me
I choose to love when everything around me screams hate
I choose to hÐµal when I have walked through sorrow and pain
I choosÐµ Your name, the only name that's worthy of praise
I choose You, Jesus
'Cause I still believe through it all
I still believe You are wonderful
You've never given up on me
'Cause I still believe You are powerful
I still believe You do miracles
You've never given up on me
You've never given up on me, yeah
You've never given up on me
The world may say, "Where is Your God?"
We will say, "He's right here with us"
The world may say, "Where is Your God?"
We will say, "He's right here with us"
The world may say, "Where is Your God?"
But we will say, "He's right here with us"
The world may say, "Where is Your God?"
But we will say, "He's right here with us"
His name is Jesus, oh Jesus
His name is Jesus, Jesus
'Cause I still believe through it all
I still believe You are wonderful
You've never given up on me
'Cause I still believe You are powerful
I still believe You do miracles
You've never given up on me
You've never given up on me
You've never given up on me
