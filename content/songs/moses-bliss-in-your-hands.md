intro
I'm going no where without you
Oh oh oh oh
You are my anchor
I'm doing nothing without you
Oh Oh Oh oh
My life depends on you
where you lead me I will go Lord
precious holy spirit
This life I live, I live for you
oh God, my  life depends on you
My life is in your hands (*3)
You're  the love of my life
You're the love of my life
every thing belong to you
u're the love of my life
