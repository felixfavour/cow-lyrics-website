Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away
Oh, here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
Should the Lord allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
So have yourself a merry little Christmas
Oh and have yourself a merry little Christmas now
All of our faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Oh, and through the years we'll always be together
Should the Lord allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
