Oh hallelujah, thank You Jesus
Oh hallelujah, our God saves
Oh hallelujah, highest praises
Oh hallelujah, we give thanks
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm grateful for who You are
And all You've done
Thank You Lord for saving me
Thank You Lord for saving me
Oh my soul cries hallelujah
Thank You Lord for saving me
[Bridge]
You've been so good
You've been so good
I thank You Lord, I thank You
My heart is full, My heart is full
I love You Lord, I love You
[Refrain]
How can I forget, how can I forget
What You've done for me, You are faithful
Never failed me yet, never failed me yet
You are good to me and I'm grateful, grateful
