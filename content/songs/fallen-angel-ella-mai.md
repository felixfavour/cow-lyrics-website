Never felt a love like yours
Still waitin' to see your flaws
Even though my heart's been torn apart
I still welcome you with open arms
(
Boys talking down, I got them diamonds in my mouth
)
[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Maybe this is compensation
For unmet expectations
Feels so good to be true, been questionin' you
But lately
You make me feel at home, but I know where you're from
Where you're from
[Chorus: Ella Mai]
Ooh, it's a long, long way from Heaven
Ooh, you're a long, long way from Heaven
And I know you don't belong
So let's make the most of this
Ooh, you're a long, long way, long way
Tailor-made, straight from my dreams
I feel awake whеn you're with me
Got me thinkin' this might bе love, love, love, love (Love)
Why is so hard to believe?
(
Boys talking down, I got them diamonds in my mouth
)
