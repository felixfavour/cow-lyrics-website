Oh yeah
Yeah
Your love has captured me
Your grace has set me free
Your life the air I breathe
Be glorified in me
Your love has captured me
Your grace has set me free
Your life the air I breathe
Be glorified in me
You set my feet to dancing, You set my heart on fire
In the presence of a thousand kings, You are my one desire
And I stand before You now with trembling hands lifted high
Be glorified
Be glorified
Your love has captured me
Your grace has set me free
Your life the air I breathe
Be glorified in me
You set my feet to dancing, You set my heart on fire
In the presence of a thousand kings, You are my one desire
And I stand before You now with trembling hands lifted high
Be lifted high
