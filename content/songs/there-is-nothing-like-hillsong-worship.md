Father true and merciful
Bound to me with love
Adopted in free from all sin
Jesus Saviour glorified
Your offering none could give
I stand before You humbled and in awe

And all
To You God
For all You are to me

There is nothing like
There is nothing like
Your Love.. Your Love
Holy Spirit gift of God
Teach my soul to soar
Train me in Your Holy ways oh Lord
