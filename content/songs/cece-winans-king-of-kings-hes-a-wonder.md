He's so good
I love Him, I love Him, yes I do
Oh yeah, yeah
King of kings and Lord of lords
Lover of my soul Jehova
One and only God I am
Jesus Christ the Holy Lamb
King of kings and Lord of lords
Lover of my soul Jehova
One and only God I am
Jesus Christ the Holy Lamb
Thy truth reaches the clouds
Your mercy never runs out
We give You honor, be thou exalted
Above the Heavens and above the earth
I give all glory unto Your name
King of kings and Lord of lords
Lover of my soul Jehova
One and only God I am
Jesus Christ the Holy Lamb
King of kings and Lord of lords
Lover of my soul Jehova
One and only God I am
Jesus Christ the Holy Lamb
Hills melt in Your presence
And Your foes tremble at Your awesome power
I will rejoice now and forever 'cause You are mine
So gracious and so divine
King of kings and Lord of lords
Lover of my soul Jehova
One and only God I am
Jesus Christ the Holy Lamb
King of kings and Lord of lords
Lover of my soul Jehova
One and only God I am
Jesus Christ the Holy Lamb
