All of my help, all of my help comes from the Lord
All of my help, all of my help comes from the Lord
All of my help, all of my help comes from the Lord
All of my help, all of my help comes from the Lord
He has made a way out of no way
Turned darkness to light on a cloudy day
That's why I praise him
For He's good, yes He's good
All of my help, all of my help comes from the Lord
All of my help, all of my help comes from the Lord
All of my help, all of my help comes from the Lord
All of my help, all of my help comes from the Lord
He has made a way out of no way
Turned darkness to light on a cloudy day
That's why I praise him
For He's good, yes He's good
He is my refuge, best friend
In the time of trouble He will be there
That's why I praise him
For He's good, yes He's good
My help, my help comes from the Lord, He is my help
My help, my help comes from the Lord, He is my help
My help, my help comes from the Lord, He is my help
My help, my help comes from the Lord, He is my help
My help, my present help
Jesus my help, my help, my present help
He is my help, my help, my present help
Jesus my help, my help, my present help
He is my help, He is my help
He is my help, He is my help
He is my help, He is my help
My help, my present help
Jesus my help, my help, my present help
He is my help
