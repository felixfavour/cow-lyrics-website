God our creator and king, watching over us
We lift our voices and sing, You are glorious
We adore You now, let Your love pour out on us
Saturate us
We fill the air with the song of Your praise, You are worthy and we give You glory
We reach for the heavens 'cause we want Your presence to fill this place
And You fill the air with the rain from the clouds of Your glory
And You saturate us
You open the heavens and cover Your people with love and grace
Saturate us, saturate us now
Open heaven, let Your love pour out on us
Saturate us
God our creator and king, reigning over us
We lift our voices and sing, You are glorious
We adore You now, let Your love pour out on us
Saturate us
We fill the air with the song of Your praise, You are worthy and we give You glory
We reach for the heavens 'cause we want Your presence to fill this place
And You fill the air with the rain from the clouds of Your glory
And You saturate us
You open the heavens and cover Your people with love and grace
Saturate us, saturate us now
Open heaven, let Your love pour out on us
Saturate us
Saturate us, saturate us now
Open heaven, let Your love pour out on us
Saturate us
We fill the air with the song of Your praise You are worthy
We fill the air with the song of Your praise You are worthy
We fill the air with the song of Your praise You are worthy
We fill the air with the song of Your praise You are worthy
And You fill the air with the rain from the clouds of Your glory
And You fill the air with the rain from the clouds of Your glory
And You fill the air with the rain from the clouds of Your glory
And You fill the air with the rain from the clouds of Your glory
...
Saturate us, saturate us now
Open heaven, let Your love pour out on us
Saturate us
