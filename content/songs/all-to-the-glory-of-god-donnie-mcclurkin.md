I don't wanna sing about the pain anymore
Only wanna sing about the One I adore
And dedicate my life to Him
And be a sacrifice for Him
All to the glory of God
I don't wanna sing about the pain anymore
I only wanna sing about the One I adore
Dedicate my life to Him
Be a sacrifice for Him
All to the glory of God
All to the glory of God
All to the glory of God
I live for the glory of God
All to the glory of God
Oh what a wonderful feeling it is
To know He is mine and to know I am His
Tell about His glory
And His redemption story
All to bring the glory to God
All to the glory of God
All to the glory of God
I live for the glory of God
All to bring glory to God
All to the glory of God
All to the glory of God
I live for the glory of God
All to bring glory to God
