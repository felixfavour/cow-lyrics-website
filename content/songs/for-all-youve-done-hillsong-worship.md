My Saviour, Redeemer
Lifted me from the miry clay
Almighty forever
I will never be the same
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause You came near from the everlasting
To the world we live
The Father's only Son
And You lived, You died
You rose again on high
You opened the way
For the world to live again
Hallelujah for all You've done
