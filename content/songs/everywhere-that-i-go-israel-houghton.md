Go
I belong to You, You belong to me Lord
I'm surrounded everywhere that I go
I will walk with You, You will walk with me Lord
I'm surrounded everywhere that I go
Oh, would you sing it with me?
I belong to You, You belong to me Lord
I'm surrounded everywhere that I go
I will walk with You, You will walk with me Lord
I'm surrounded everywhere that I go
And I am Yours and You are mine, oh mine
You promised me You'd never leave
You promised me I'm never forsaken
I believe goodness and mercy will follow me
Surrounding me where I go, everywhere that I go
I belong to You, You belong to me Lord
I'm surrounded everywhere that I go
I will walk with You, You will walk with me Lord
I'm surrounded everywhere that I go
And I am Yours and You are mine, oh mine
