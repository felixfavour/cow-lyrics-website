Now the darkness fades, into new beginnings
As we lift our eyes to a hope beyond
All creation waits, with an expectation
To declare the reign of the Lord our God
We will not be moved, when the earth gives way
For the risen One has overcome
And for every fear, there's an empty grave
For the risen One has overcome
Now the silence breaks, in the name of Jesus
As the heavens cry let the earth respond
All creation shouts, with a voice of triumph
To declare the reign of the Lord our God
We will not be moved, when the earth gives way
For the risen One has overcome
And for every fear, there's an empty grave
For the risen One has overcome
[Bridge]
He shall reign forever
Strongholds now surrender
For the Lord our God has overcome
Who can be against us?
Jesus our Defender
He is Lord and He has overcome
He shall reign forever
Strongholds now surrender
For the Lord our God has overcome
Who can be against us?
Jesus our Defender
He is Lord and He has overcome!...
