VERSE 1:
We walk on this narrow road
Now restored as one we walk
In Your hope
And though
Darkness fills our path
Fear won't fix its hold on us
For we know
CHORUS:
Love will shine before us on our path
And guide our every step within the dark
VERSE 2:
We bear tidings of Your hope
Freedom from the sinner's plight
Through Your love
Our eyes set upon this task
Truth in hand as one we walk
We advance
CHORUS 2:
Love will shine before us on our path
To guide our every step within the dark
To know You is our only cry
Knowing You our only cry
Knowing You our only cry
