Yes, the world will bow down and say You are God
Every man will bow down and say You are King
So let's start right now
Why would we wait?
[Chorus: Shana Wilson-Williams]
King of Glory, fill this place
We just wanna be with You
Just wanna be with You
King of Glory, fill this place
Just wanna be with You
Just wanna be with You
Yes, the world will bow down and say You are God
Every man will bow down and say You are King
So let's start right now
Why would we wait
We can praise You now
In victory
[Chorus: Todd Dulaney & Shana Wilson-Williams]
King of Glory, fill this place
We just wanna be with You
Just wanna be with You
King of Glory, fill this place
Just wanna be with You
Just wanna be with You
