Sometimes you feel like
God has forgotten about you
And you're all alone wondering what to do
The pressure is on and the pain is real
Wondering where it started
And does he hear your prayer
Be encouraged and know
Help is on the way.
Just keep waiting
You're not mistaken
He's never too far away.
He's in the secret place.
Sometime you feel like
God has forgotten about you
And you're all alone wondering what to do
The pressure is on and the pain is real
Wondering where it started
And does he hear your prayer
Be encouraged and know
Help is on the way.
Just keep waiting
You're not mistaken
He's never too far away. [4x]
