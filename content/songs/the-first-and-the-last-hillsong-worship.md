You are the first and the last, beginning and the end
The promise of one who's to come, the future is in Your hands
Calling the light with all the earth we will sing
You are the author of love, our freedom is in Your name
Embracing the cross there for us, brought us to life again
Calling the love with all we are let us sing
God, our hope and our salvation
Worthy of all the praise, be our light everlasting
Great is Your name, Jesus the first and the last
Show us the way of Your love, lead us towards the truth
Stir up the fire in us to live out this life for You, oh!
Calling Your name Jesus forever we'll sing, yeah
God, our hope and our salvation
Worthy of all the praise, be our light everlasting
Great is Your name, Jesus the first and the last, yeah
Every heart every nation will hear the sound
As the light breaks through the darkness and Your name rings loud
Every distant horizon will meet as one
Singing, holy is Your name, we sing holy is Your name
God, our hope and our salvation (come on!)
Worthy of all the praise, be our light everlasting
Great is Your name, ooh!
God, our hope and our salvation
Worthy of all the praise, be our light everlasting
Great is Your name, Jesus the first and the last
Jesus the first and the last
You are, Jesus the first and the last
You are, first and last
You are
You're the alpha and omega
The beginning and the end
Our salvation, You bring freedom
God, Your grace it knows no end
You're the name above all names
The lamb that was slain
You are, yeah, the first and last
You are first and last
