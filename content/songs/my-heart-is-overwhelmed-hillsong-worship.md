VERSE 1:
Perfect in love
Lord, You came to earth
To rescue me
You took my place upon that cross
The stains that held me back
Were washed away
You made me whole
CHORUS:
Your love has set
The broken captives free
Your love released
The chains once binding me
I'm found in grace
In love's embrace
My heart is overwhelmed
VERSE 2:
I stand redeemed
Your Spirit now alive within my heart
I walk with you all of my days
I shall live to glorify You God
Hear my soul rejoice
CHORUS:
Your love has set
The broken captives free
Your love released the chains once binding me
I'm found in grace
In love's embrace
My heart is overwhelmed
