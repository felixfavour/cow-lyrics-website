And just like Mary
I will pour my oil out
And just like David
I will worship You alone
And just like Mary
I will pour my oil out, I'll pour it out
And just like David
I will worship You alone
[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna move Your heart
I wanna see Your face
I wanna move Your heart
I wanna see Your face
Make me a Bethany
Make me a Bethany
Come and rest here and be pleased
As I worship at Your feet
Make me a Bethany
Make me a Bethany
For the Lamb I long to see
Is the only thing that's needed
The only thing that's needed
