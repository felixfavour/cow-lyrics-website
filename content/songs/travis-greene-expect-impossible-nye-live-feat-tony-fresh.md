VERSE
I heard how You walked, walked on the Water
I read how You turned water to wine
I've seen how Your Hand could only Provide in my Life
It's a Miracle
I expect the Impossible
God can do the Unthinkable
More than I ask or think or even Imagine
My Life is a Miracle
CHORUS
God can do
Anything, Anything He wants to
Nothing's Difficult
My God can Do
Anything, Anything He wants to
Nothing's Difficult
My God can Do
VERSE 2
I heard how Your touch can heal any Leper
I read how Your hem, could make someone Whole
I've felt how Your Love could help me to Forgive myself
It's a Miracle
I expect the Impossible
God can do the Unthinkable
More than I ask
or think or even Imagine
My Life is a Miracle
BRIDGE
What He wants
When He wants
How He wants to
He's Powerful
What He wants
When He wants
How He wants to
He's In Control
