The sound of many waters
Calms the sea in me
The Voice that ends the silence
Meets me in my need
Like fireworks, igniting in my chest
The weight of Your glory, the reverence
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in awe that You would come to me
In awe that I can hear You speak
Speak to me
Speak to me
I'm listening
Speak to me
Speak to me
I'm listening
The sound that shakes the heavens
The whisper on the wind
Breaks my inhibitions and settles me within
The mystery, You're closer than my skin
Your still, small voice moving me again
