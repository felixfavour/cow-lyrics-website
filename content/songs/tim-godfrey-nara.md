He's done so much for me
I can not tell it all
Nara kele Mo
If I Had ten thousand tongues
It won't still be enough
Nara kele Mo
Chukwu na gwom o ria le
When You heal You heal completely
Nara kele mo
Chukwu mara obim o
Isi ikendu le
Nara kele mo
What shall I render to Jehovah?
For he has done so very much for me
What shall I render to Jehovah?
For he has done so very much for me
Naranara e, Narakele
Narakele Mo
Nara nara e, Narakele
Narakele Mo
Nara nara e, Narakele
Narakele Mo
Nara nara e, Narakele
Narakele Mo
Nara nara e, Narakele
Narakele Mo
What shall I render to Jehovah?
For he has done so very much for me
What shall I render to Jehovah?
For he has done so very much for me
Naranara e, Narakele
Narakele Mo
Nara nara e, Narakele
Narakele Mo
Nara nara e, Narakele
Narakele Mo
Nara nara e, Narakele
Narakele Mo
What shall I render to Jehovah?
For he has done so very much for me
What shall I render to Jehovah?
For he has done so very much for me
