[Chorus: Kirk Franklin & 
Maverick City Choir
]
You don't have to worry (you don't have to worry)
And don't you be afraid (and don't you be afraid)
Joy comes (joy comes in the morning)
Troubles they don't last always (troubles they don't last always)
For there is (for there's a friend named Jesus)
Who will wipe your tears (who will wipe your tears away)
And if your heart (and if your heart is broken)
Just lift your hands and say (just lift your hands and say)
I know that I can make it (Hallelujah)
I know that I can stand
No matter what may come (no matter what may come my way)
My life (my life is in your hands)
With Jesus I can take it (with Jesus I can take it)
With Him, I know (with Him I know I can stand)
No matter (no matter what may come my way)
My life is in your hands
[Refrain: Kirk Franklin, 
Chandler Moore
 & 
Maverick City Choir

Hallelujah
I know that I can make it (I know that I can make it)
I know that I can stand (I know that I can stand)

With Him, I know (with Him I know I can stand)

I know that (I know that I can stand)
You can sing like (no matter what may come my way)
You can sing like (my life is in Your hands)
With Jesus I can take it (with Jesus I can take it)
Come on! with Him I know (with Him, I know I can stand)
No matter (no matter what may come my way)
My life is in Your hands
Go one more
I know (I know that I can make it)
Come on, come on! (I know that I can stand)
No matter (no matter what may come my way)
My life (my life is in Your hands)
