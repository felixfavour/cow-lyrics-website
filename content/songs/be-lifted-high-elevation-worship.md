Lay down my rights
Lay down my life
I will abandon
All of my pride
Focus my eyes
Away from myself
You become greater
I become less
You be lifted high
You be lifted higher
I belong to you
I am nothing without you
You be lifted high
You be lifted higher
I belong to you
I am nothing without you
Jesus be all
Consume every part
My greatest desire
I give You my heart
Focus my eyes
Away from myself
You become greater
I become less
You be lifted high
You be lifted higher
I belong to you
I am nothing without you
You be lifted high
You be lifted higher
I belong to you
I am nothing without you
In every victory
In every trial
My soul will sing
Be lifted high
With every heartbeat
All of my life
Jesus forever be lifted high
You be lifted high
You be lifted higher
I belong to you
I am nothing without you
You be lifted high
You be lifted higher
I belong to you
I am nothing without you
In every victory
In every trial
My soul will sing
Be lifted high
With every heartbeat
All of my life
Jesus forever be lifted high
In every victory
In every trial
My soul will sing
Be lifted high
With every heartbeat
All of my life
Jesus forever be lifted high
You be lifted high
You be lifted high (higher)
You be lifted high (higher)
You be lifted high
Lifted high
You be lifted high (higher)
You be lifted high (higher)
You be lifted high (higher)
