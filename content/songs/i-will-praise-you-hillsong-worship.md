Your love came first
Before I knew the cross You carried
Now free at last
I’ll freely give as I’ve been given
[Pre-Chorus]
For everything You’ve done
And everything to come
I will praise You
Live to glorify Your Name
Forever anthem Your acclaim
Lord I will sing Your praise
I will praise You
In the promise and the pain
For as long as life remains
Still I will sing Your praise
Should words fall short
May they fall in honest worship
Till all I am
Breaks in reverence at Your feet
