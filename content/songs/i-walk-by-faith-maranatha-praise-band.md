I walk by faith, each step by faith
To live by faith, I put my trust in You
I walk by faith, each step by faith
To live by faith, I put my trust in You
Every step I take is a step of faith
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Every prayer I make is a prayer of faith
And if my God is for me
Who can be against me?
I put my trust in You, I put my trust in You;
I put my trust in You, I put my trust in You
I put my trust in You.I walk by faith, each step by faith
To live by faith, I put my trust in You
I walk by faith, each step by faith
To live by faith, I put my trust in You
Every step I take is a step of faith
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Every prayer I make is a prayer of faith
And if my God is for me
Who can be against me?
I put my trust in You, I put my trust in You;
I put my trust in You, I put my trust in You
I put my trust in You. I walk by faith, each step by faith
To live by faith, I put my trust in You
I walk by faith, each step by faith
To live by faith, I put my trust in You
