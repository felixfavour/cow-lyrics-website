(Lead: male)
Show me Your face
I want to see You
I want to see
Your Glory
I want to live
In the secret place
Show me your face
(x2)
(Lead: female)
I'm not satisfied
With where I've been
Though I've cried out before
Still I want more
I want to see your power
This very hour
So do it in me
(Unison:)
Show me Your face
I want to see You
I want to see
Your Glory
I want to live
In the secret place
Show me Your face
