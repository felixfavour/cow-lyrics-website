CHORUS
You are my love and my light
You are my purpose for living
You are my hope in the night
My reason for singing
You bring the joy to my life
(And You're)Making it better and better
And I will give thanks forever and ever 2x
Will we ever know
What we have been given
He has chosen us and called us His own
Flowing from His throne
There is a river
Bringing life and health wherever it goes
CHORUS
You are my love and my light
You are my purpose for living
You are my hope in the night
My reason for singing
You bring the joy to my life
(And You're)Making it better and better
And I will give thanks forever and ever
