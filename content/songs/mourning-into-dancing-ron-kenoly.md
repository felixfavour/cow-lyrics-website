[Chorus]
He's turned my mourning into dancing again
He's lifted my sorrows
And I can't stay silent
I must sing for His joy has come
He's turned my mourning into dancing again
He's lifted my sorrows
And I can't stay silent
I must sing for His joy has come
Where there once was only hurt
He gave His healing hand
Where there once was only pain
He brought comfort like a friend
I feel the sweetness of His love piercing my darkness
I see the bright and morning sun
As it ushers in His joyful gladness
He's turned my mourning into dancing again
He's lifted my sorrows
And I can't stay silent
I must sing for His joy has come
You've turned my mourning into dancing again
You've lifted my sorrows
And I can't stay silent
I must sing for Your joy has come
