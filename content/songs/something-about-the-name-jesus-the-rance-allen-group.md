Hallelujah, young people
There's nothing wrong with dancing for Jesus
But we can't forget where we come from
So if don't mind, let's have a little church right now
Something about the name Jesus
Something about the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name, I know
Oh, how I love the name Jesus
Oh, how I love the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name, I know
Some people say I'm crazy but I can't explain
The power that I feel when I call Your name
(When I call Your name)
Said it's just like fire, shut up in my bones
The holy ghost is moving
And it just won't leave me alone
Something about the name Jesus
Something about the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name, I know
Oh, how I love the name Jesus
Oh, how I love the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name, I know
