Where would I run but to the throne of mercy
Where would I kneel but at the cross of grace
How great the love, how strong the hand that holds us
Beautiful, so beautiful
So here I bow, to lift You high
Jesus, be glorified
In all things, for all my life
I am Yours, forever Yours
There is a King who bore the scars of healing
There is a Son who came in grace and truth
How great the love that carries us to kindness
Wonderful, You're wonderful
So here I bow, to lift You high
Jesus, be glorified
In all things, for all my life
I am Yours, forever Yours
[Bridge]
God, here and now, be lifted high
Right here and now, be glorified
God of heaven and earth
God, who brought me back to life
I am Yours, forever Yours
God, here and now, be lifted high
Right here and now, be glorified
God of heaven and earth
God, who brought me back to life
I am Yours, forever Yours
