From heaven to earth, our Saviour came
For us on a cross, He bled and died
And from the cross to an empty grave
He rose to life, He rose to life
He lives, reigning in power
He lives, Name above all names
Hallelujah, now forever
Hallelujah, Christ is risen!
All glory to Him upon the throne
Forever exalted and seated high
The Lamb of God He has overcome!
He is alive, He is alive!
He lives, reigning in power
He lives, Name above all names
Hallelujah, now forever
Hallelujah, Christ is risen!
He is risen
[Bridge]
And on that day with Him I'll rise
For Christ He lives in me
This life I live, no longer mine
For Christ He lives in me
And on that day with Him I'll rise
For Christ He lives in me
This life I live, no longer mine
For Christ He lives in me
