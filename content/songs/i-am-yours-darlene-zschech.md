God of grace
God of love
God of mercy
All glorious
In Your presence I remain
Your love filling me again
I am Yours
I am Yours
God of peace
God of strength
God of wonders
My defense
I will worship at Your throne
Your sacrifice has made me whole
I am Yours
I am Yours
Behold the Lamb of God
Who takes away my sin
Lord Jesus crucified for me
This love that knows no end
Your love has set me free
To You I give my all
I am Yours
