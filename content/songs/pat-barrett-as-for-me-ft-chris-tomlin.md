Your love, oh Lord, is strength to my soul
Hope for tomorrow, it won't let go
Your presence is the joy of my life
To You I lift my eyes
As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord
We will sing of Your love forevermore
As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord
Serve the Lord
Your word alone, a lamp to my feet
A light to my path as You're leading me
Your ways, oh Lord, are higher than mine
To You I lift my eyes
As for me and my house, wÐµ will serve the Lord
WÐµ will sing of Your love forevermore
As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord
Serve the Lord
