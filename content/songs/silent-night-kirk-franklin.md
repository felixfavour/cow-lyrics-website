[Intro: Kirk Franklin, 
Choir
]
This holiday season, from our family to yours
We wish you season's greetings and God's great joy
Family
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
It was
It was a silent night
A holy night
All is calm
And all so bright (
Round yon
)
Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild (
Sleep in
)
Sleep in heaven (
Hahaha, oh so
)
Oh so heaven (
Hallelujah, sleep in
)
Sleep in heaven
Sleep
Sleep in heavenly peace
[Interlude: Kirk Franklin]
Hallelujah
Thank You for Your child
Let's say it again
It was
