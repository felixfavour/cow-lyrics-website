It feels like all the songs have probably been sung
I wanna bring You something true
Something that moves You
I don't have all the words
To tell You how much You're worth
But I wanna bring You something true
Something that moves You
From the dawn to the dusk of my days
From the depths of my soul and with all of my strength
Here is my heart in just one phrase
Jesus I love You, I love You
When I say it, I mean it, it's true
And I hope You can see it in all that I do
I know it might be nothing new
But Jesus I love You, I love You I do
I'm sure the angels sing beautiful melodiеs
But I wanna bring a song that's mine
For the rest of my lifе
Oh I wanna bring a song that's mine
For the rest of my life
