Verse 1:
He gave me a life
He gave me a faith
He gave me a victory
Now I stand undefeated
I'm living victoriously
The life that I live
I live by the faith
Of the son of god, who loved me
And gave himself for me
I live victoriously
He gave me a life
He gave me a faith
He gave me a victory
Now I stand undefeated
I'm living victoriously
The life that I live
I live by the faith
Of the son of god, who loved me
And gave himself for me
I live victoriously
(you're the god of miracles)
