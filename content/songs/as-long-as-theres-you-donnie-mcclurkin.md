I'm not thinking about those sights
Won't be there to enjoy the view
I think heaven will be alright
just as long as Your there, as long as there is You

If I never hear an angel sing
In a far off holy land
If I never hear a joy bell ring
Sing a in a Christian band

I'm not thinking about those sights
Won't be there to enjoy the view
I think heaven will be alright
just as long as Your there, as long as there is You

I'm not thinking about the sights
Won't be there to enjoy the view
I think heaven will be alright
Just as long as Your there, as long as there is You

I'm not thinking about the sights
Won't be there to enjoy the view
I think heaven will be alright
Just as long as Your there, as long as there is You

I'm not thinking about the sights
Won't be there to enjoy the view
I think heaven will be alright
(Just as long as Your there)rpt

When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing that will be
When we all see Jesus
We will sing and shout the victory

When we all get to heaven
What a day of rejoicing that will be
When we all see Jesus
We will sing and shout the victory
I'm not thinking about the sights
Won't be there to enjoy the view
I think heaven will be alright
Just as long as Your there, as long as there is You
I'm not thinking about the sights
Won't be there to enjoy the view
I think heaven will be alright
