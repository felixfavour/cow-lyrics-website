I stand amazed in the presence of Jesus
The Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me
A sinner, condemned, unclean
How marvelous! How wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous!
How wonderful is my Savior's love for me!
For me it was in the garden He prayed:
"Not My will, but Thine."He had no tears for His own griefs
But sweat drops of blood for mine
How marvelous! How wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous!
How wonderful is my Savior's love for me!
He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calvary and
Suffered and died alone
When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
'twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me!
How marvelous! How wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous!
How wonderful is my Savior's love for me!
How marvelous!
How wonderful is my Savior's love for me!
