You are enthroned in heaven
Beauty unlike I've ever seen
No eye has seen
You are enthroned in heaven
I am a sinner on my knees
Woe is me
Holy, You are holy
There is none beside Thee
And all Your works shall praise Your name
Singing holy, You are holy
Your voice is a burning ember
One touch and I'm forever changed
I'm not the same
Your voice is a burning ember
Each time I hear You call my name
I'm not the same
Holy, You are holy
There is none beside Thee
And all Your works shall praise Your name
Singing holy, You are holy
Singing holy, You are holy
