there in my reflection, man, this world's been messin'
It's been messin' with your mind
(Hey girl) someone stole your smile now, it's been a little while now
Happiness is hard to find
Letting everybody and their mother try to tell you what you're worth
Oh, what you're worth
When did you forget that the one who made you told you what you're worth?
Repeat after me
I'm a blood bought, battle fought, all my shame long gone
Made new child of the King
I'm an amen, testify, holy water baptized
Went down and came up clean
I'm a soul been saved by that amazing grace
And now there ain't no way, girl, can't take that away, girl
Don't forget you're free
It's who you're made to be, hey girl
don't you know you're beautiful?
Crazy kind of wonderful, and there's no one like you
(Hey girl) you don't need to measure up
You are the treasure of the God who loves you
No more letting everybody and their mother try to tell you what you're worth
What you're worth
And if you should forget, let the one who made you tell you what you're worth
And repeat after me
I'm a blood bought, battle fought, all my shame long gone
Made new child of the King
I'm an amen, testify, holy water baptized
Went down and came up clean
I'm a soul been saved by that amazing grace
And now there ain't no way, girl
Can't take that away, girl, don't forget you're free
It's who you're made to be, hey girl
Oh yeah (hey girl)
(Hey girl)
I'm glad we had this talk now, think we said it all now
But here's a little last advice
Live free, walk in victory
And repeat after me
I'm a blood bought, battle fought, all my shame long gone
Made new child of the King
I'm an amen, testify, holy water baptized
Went down and came up clean
I'm a soul been saved by that amazing grace
And now there ain't no way, girl
Can't take that away, girl, don't forget you're free
It's who you're made to be, hey girl
Oh (hey girl)
Hey girl
