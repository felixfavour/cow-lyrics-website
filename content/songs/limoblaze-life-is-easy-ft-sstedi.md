You want someone in life for you
Pay a price for you
Not only laid his life for you
He will fight for you
It's not what you do but it's how he
He can move through you
It's not what you do but it's how he
He can live through you
Life is easy you know his yoke is easy
There's Only one kingdom that can come and give you the keys
Taste and you shall see how it's supposed to be
You know his yoke is easy
