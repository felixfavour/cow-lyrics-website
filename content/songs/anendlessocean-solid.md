Oh my evergreen
I resonate with you ever-ly
Oh I surrendere to thee
Can I contemplate you?
Never! I never will
Oh oh oh
Solid
Gidigbangba
Your love solid
Oh oh oh
I heed
Bi Alangba
I nod to you always
I'm heading your way.
You're always there to fight my battles
I no dey fear gun, I no dey fear sword
I no go hear word
If any body tell me otherwise from you
Me I go follow through
Till thy kingdom come along
You do me softly like omomo
(Yea you make my heart race yeah
Put me on pace yea, fearful aside yea
You got me brave
Yea you make my heart race yeah
Put me on pace yea, yea more of you yes yes
Less of me yea)(2ce)
Oh my center still
I toss and turn in you oh how good the feels
Oh I remember the thrills
Then and now the future you hold for me is real
Oh oh oh
Solid
Gidigbangba
Your love solid
Oh oh oh
I heed
Bi Alangba
I nod to you always
I'm heading your way.
You're always there to fight my battles
I no dey fear gun, I no dey fear sword
I no go hear word
If any body tell me otherwise from you
Me I go follow through
Till thy kingdom come along
You do me softly like omomo
(Yea you make my heart race yeah
Put me on pace yea, fearful aside yea
You got me brave
Yea you make my heart race yeah
Put me on pace yea, yea more of you yes yes
Less of me yea)(2ce)
