[Chorus]
Sing and be glad in Him
Lift up your hands to Him
Tell of the glorious things He has done
Dance and rejoice in Him
Lift up your voice to Him
Declare His praises to this generation
Sing and be glad in Him
Lift up your hands to Him
Tell of the glorious things He has done
Dance and rejoice in Him
Lift up your voice to Him
Declare His praises to this generation
One generation shall praise His works to another
And declare His mighty deeds
Our celebration of Christ the Lord
Shall uncover who It is they need
Sing and be glad in Him
Lift up your hands to Him
Tell of thе glorious things He has done
Dance and rеjoice in Him
Lift up your voice to Him
Declare His praises to this generation
