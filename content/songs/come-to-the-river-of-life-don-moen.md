Come to the river of life
You will find healing there
Come to the river of life
Come and drink freely here
Come if your heart is searching
O, come if your soul is thirsty
Draw near and drink of
The mercy of Jesus Christ, oh yes
And the river of life
There is a river
Whose strems make glad
The city of God, the city of God
So come if you're wounded or sad
There is a river, there is a river
Come to the river of life
You will find healing there
Come to the river of life
Come and drink freely here
Come if your heart is searching
O, come if your soul is thirsty
Draw near and drink of
The mercy of Jesus Christ, oh yes
And the river of life
