My God is able
I can testify
If you call on Him
You won't be denied
His ear is not deaf
And His arms is not short
He'll give you what you need
So why don't you get smart
Put your trust in Him
He can make a way
He'll walk right beside you
Each and every day
He'll put money in your pocket
And food on your table
I'm telling you what I know
God is able
