When you're weary, feeling small
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all
I'm on your side, oh, when times get rough
And friends just can't, they can't be found
[Chorus: Natalie Grant, 
Tasha Cobbs Leonard
]
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down (
Yes, I will
)
Oh, when you're down and out, when you're on the street
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you, oh, yes, I will
I'll take your part
Woah, when darkness comes
And pain is all, it's 
all around
[Chorus: 
Tasha Cobbs Leonard & Natalie Grant
, Tasha Cobbs Leonard, 
Natalie Grant
]
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Likе a bridge over troubled watеr
Oh, I will lay me down
 (I'm gonna lay me down)
I will lay me down, woo!
 (Oh, oh, yes, I will)
Whenever You need me
 (Whenever You need)
I'm gonna come on running
 (Woo!)
(Whenever You need)
I'm gonna come running
 (I'll come running, oh)
