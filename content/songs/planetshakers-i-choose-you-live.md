So many things
They fight for my attention
So I shift
My gaze in Your direction
Yeah I look to You God
Oh even when the clouds are rolling in
Yeah I'll live for You God
Oh even when my world is caving in
I choose You
I choose You
No matter when and over again
I choose You
(One two three, let's go!)
And every day
I'm faced with these decisions
But overall
I choose to follow Jesus
Yeah I look to You God
Oh even when the clouds are rolling in
I'll live for You God
Even when my world is caving in
I choose You
I choose You
No matter when and over again
I choose You
(One two three, let's go!)
I choose to praise You and I choose to sing
With all my heart, with everything
You're the everlasting God and King
You are the way, You are the way
I choose to praise You and I choose to sing
With all my heart, with everything
You're the everlasting God and King
You are the way, You are the way
I choose You
I choose You
No matter when and over again
I choose You
(One two three, let's go!)
I choose You
I choose You
I choose You
I choose You
I choose You
