Intro: Dance for me, shake body, my God is good o shake body
Oya dance for me, shake body, my God is good o shake body
Verse 1: Lord you give me peace every day
Lord you make me dance every day like non stop, like non stop
Baba just like that you too dey blow my mind, I overflow right now, your blessings dey for here, your blessings dey for here
Hook: you took the worries away, I follow you all the way, all the way, all the wayyyy, all the way
I've never seen no one like you
You're beginning and the end
You're the only one for me
And I will never let you go
Jehovah imela (2X) all power bow before you, every tongue confess you're God (repeat)
