Narrow as the road may seem
I'll follow where your spirit leads
Broken as my life may be
I will give You every piece
I hear You call
I am available
I say, "Yes, Lord
I am available"Here I am with open hands
Counting on Your grace again
Less of me and more of You
Oh, I just wanna see You move
I hear You call
I am available
I say, "Yes, Lord
I am available"I hear You call
I am available
I say, "Yes, Lord
I am available"
