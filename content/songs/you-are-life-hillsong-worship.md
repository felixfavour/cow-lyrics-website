You have come
And we have found life
Everlasting
Now alive
To know Your freedom
Never ending
[Pre-Chorus]
You alone have made a way for us
In Your love
You are life
I'm living in the light of my Saviour
Dancing in the arms of forever
I'm singing like I'm walking on water
You are life
Alive in me
From greyest skies
To living color
You have called us
In Your life
Your light uncovered
The world to see now
