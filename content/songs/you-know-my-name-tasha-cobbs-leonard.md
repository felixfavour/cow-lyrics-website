He knows my name
He knows my name
He knows my name
Yes, He knows my name
And oh, how  He walks with me
Yes, oh, how He talks with me
And oh, how He tells me
That I am His own
You know my name
You know my name
You know my name
You know my name
And oh, how You comfort me
And oh, how You counsel me
Yet it still amazes me
That I am Your friend
So now, I pour out
My heart to You
Here in Your presence
I am made new
So now, I pour out
My heart to You
Here in Your presence
I am made new
