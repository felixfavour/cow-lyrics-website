[Intro]
It's a song we learned in Zimbabwe
You are Alpha and Omega, sing
We worship You, our Lord
You are worthy to be praised (Sing it again)
You are Alpha and Omega
We worship You, our Lord
You are worthy to be praised (We give You all the glory)
We give You all the glory
We worship You, our Lord
You are worthy to be praised (We give You all the glory)
We give You all the glory (We worship You)
We worship You, our Lord
You are worthy to be praised (Said You are Alpha and Omega)
You are Alpha and Omega
We worship You, our Lord
You are worthy to be praised (We give You all, we give You all, we give You all, weâ€”)
We give You all the glory
We worship You, our Lord
You are worthy to be praised
We give You all the glory
We worship You, our Lord
You are worthy to be praised (Come on, say it again, we give You all)
We give You all the glory
We worship You our Lord
You are worthy to be praised (Come on, one more time, declare it, declare it)
We give You all the glory
We worship You, our Lord
You are worthy to be praised (We give You all)
