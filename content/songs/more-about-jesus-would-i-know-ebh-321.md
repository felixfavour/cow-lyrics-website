1. More about Jesus would I know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me.
 
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me.

2. More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me

3. More about Jesus; in His Word,
Holding communion with my Lord;
Hearing His voice in every line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me

4. More about Jesus; on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdomâ€™s sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace.

More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me
