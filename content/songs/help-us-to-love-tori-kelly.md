[Intro: Tori Kelly]
Mmm, no
Mmm, yeah
[Chorus: Tori Kelly & 
The HamilTones
]
There's a love so high 
(that you cannot get over)
That same love's so wide 
(it'll take forever just to get round it)
But love died somewhere
Behind that cross you wear, you're afraid when you look at me
That ain't real love
Not the kind from above, hmm
But there's a friend of mine 
(that stays closer than a brother)
Oooh, love laid down his life 
(so why do we still fight one another?)
All this hate I see on the TV screen
In my country â€˜tis of thee
God, help us to love,
 to love the way that you love me
Hmmm, God help us to love the way that you love me, oh oh
[Bridge: Tori Kelly]
This world is weeping, hurting, broken and begging for change
Oh, yeah
But still we marching, praying, dying, and things stay the same
When will we see?
Till everyone's free
There'll never be peace between you and me
God, your love is the cure
For the rich and the poor
God, please will you open our eyes?
