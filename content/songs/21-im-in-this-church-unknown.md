I'm in this church, this glorious church. I didn't join, Oh I was born, I had a new birth. 

Some glorious day, gonna sail away. It's by his grace, not by my works, I'm in this church. 

When Jesus came, He was left out. There was no place where He was welcome here on earth. 

But He had a plan, for a house that shall forever stand, He spoke these words; upon this rock, I'll build my church.

I'm in this church, this glorious church. I didn't join, Oh I was born, I had a new birth. 

Some glorious day, gonna sail away. It's by his grace, not by my works, I'm in this church.
