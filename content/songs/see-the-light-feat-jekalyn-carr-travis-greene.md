[Intro: Travis Greene]
I see the light coming
No matter what it is
Then I'll face it
Jesus, You're the light
Woah-oh-ooh...
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Darkness seems to be all around me
Searching for what my eyes cannot see
Where to go next and who can I trust
No one but You, my hope is Jesus
[Chorus: Travis Greene]
I can see the light
I can see the light coming
I can see the light
I can see the light coming
[Refrain: Travis Greene]
This won't last
Your word will come to pass
I can see the light
Coming, it's coming
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
