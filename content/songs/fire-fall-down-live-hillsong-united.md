You bought my life with the blood that You shed on the cross
When You died for the sins of men
And You let out a cry
Crucified, now alive in me
These hands are Yours, teach them to serve as You please
And I'll reach out, desperate to see
All the greatness of God
Now my soul rest assured in You
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
'Cause I know that You're alivе
You came to fix my broken life
And I'll sing to glorify Your holy namе
Jesus Christ
You've changed it all, You broke down the wall
When I spoke and confessed, in You I am blessed
Now I walk in the light
In victorious sight of You
