Like the water's roar
Is your voice, o lord
There is none before
And none beside
You are set apart
You alone are god
Your glory reaches far
From sky to sky
Holy, holy, lord god almighty
Early in the morning we will sing
Holy, holy, we bow down before thee
All your children love to sing your name
God almighty
You're the breath of life
You're the god on high
Your song shall rise
And never pass away
O, your majesty
Evermore shall be
The earth, the skies, the sea
Shall bring you praise
