On the hill of Calvary, the Light of all the world
With the world on His shoulders
The weight of all our shame, on Him who knew no sin
A Holy surrender
The sky went dark, the Angels wept
The Father looked away
The final breath, He bowed His head
The lamb of God was slain
By His wounds I am set free
By His blood I've been redeemed
The great divide He crossed for me
Oh, praise the God of Calvary
On the hill of Calvary, into the Father's hands
A Holy surrender
A borrowed tomb, His mother wept
And there His body lay
The stone was moved, He conquered death
And rose from the grave
By His wounds I am set free
By His blood I've been redeemed
The great divide He crossed for me
Oh, praise the God of Calvary
