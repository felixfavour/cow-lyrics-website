[Interlude]
La-da-da da-da da-da
La-da-da da-da da-da
La-da-da da-da da-da da-da
La-da-da da-da da-da
La-da-da da-da da-da
La-da-da da-da da-da da-da
How I live for the moments
Where I'm still in Your presence
All the noise dies down
Lord, speak to me now
You have all my attention
I will linger and listen
I can't miss a thing
[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all
All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
