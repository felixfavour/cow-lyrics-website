God, I'm on my knees again
God, I'm begging please again
I need You
Lord, I need You
Walking down these desert roads
Water for my thirsty soul
I need You
Yes,  God, I need
Your forgiveness
Is like sweet, sweet honey on my lips
Like the sound of a symphony to my ears
Like holy water on my skin
Dead man walking, slave to sin
I wanna know about being born again
I need You
Oh, Lord, I need You
So, take me to the riverside
Take me under, baptize
I need You, oh
God, I need You
