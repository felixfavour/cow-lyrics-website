To bring this world to life
To heal this heart of mine
Your grace enough, your grace enough
To mend this world in need
To break the chains in me
Your grace enough, now this means love
[Pre-Chorus]
The weight of all our sin upon His shoulders
We should all be called Your sons and daughters
Father, let heaven and earth collide
In the endless wonder of Your love upon the cross
We will follow and offer this life forever
To see Your love unfold
Adopted as Your own
Alive to make You known
Now this means love, this means love
[Pre-Chorus]
The weight of all our sin upon His shoulders
We should all be called Your sons and daughters
