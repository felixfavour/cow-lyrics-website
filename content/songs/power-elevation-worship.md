[Instrumental]
My weakness is hidden within Your glory
Jesus, my strength is in You
The odds are against me, but You are for me
Jesus, my strength is in You
Power belongs to the One who was and is to come
Power belongs to our God, alleluia
My steps have been ordered, You go before me
God, I'm depending on You
The hope of my future, found in You only
God, I'm depending on You
Power belongs to the One who was and is to come
Power belongs to our God, alleluia
Power belongs to the One who was and is to come
Power belongs to our God, alleluia
[Interlude]
