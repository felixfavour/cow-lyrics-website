Thanks be to God
Who always causes us to triumph in His name
Thanks be to God
Who always causes us to win

Thanks be to God
Who always causes us to triumph in His name
Thanks be to God, thanks be to God

We have overcome, hallelujah, hallelujah
We have overcome by the power of Your name
Jesus, You're the One, hallelujah, hallelujah

The One who made a way for us
To triumph in His name
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa

Thanks be to God
Who always causes us to triumph in His name
Thanks be to God
Who always causes us to win

Thanks be to God
Who always causes us to triumph in His name
Thanks be to God, thanks be to God

We have overcome, hallelujah, hallelujah
We have overcome by the power of Your name
Jesus, You're the One, hallelujah, hallelujah

The One who made a way for us
To triumph in His name
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa

We've got the victory, everything would be alright, alright
We've got the victory, everything would be alright
Cause we're on the winning side, we're on the winning side
