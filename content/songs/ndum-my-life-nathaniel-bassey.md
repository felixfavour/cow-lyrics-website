I belong to Jesus
Hundred percent
Satan has no right
He has no share
He has no stake in this life
Hallelujah
Ndum bu nke Chineke (My life belongs to God)
Ihe nile nkem nwere (Everything that I have)
Jesus nani gi ribe otuto (Jesus only you deserve the praise)
Ekwensu enweghi ike n'ebemno (The devil does not have power whеre I am)
Abum nwa nke Chukwu (I am a Child of God)
Jesus nani gi ribе otuto (Jesus only you deserve the praise)
Ndum bu nke Chineke (My life belongs to God)
Ihe nile nkem nwere (Everything that I have)
Jesus nani gi ribe otuto (Jesus only you deserve the praise)
Ekwensu enweghi ike n'ebemno (The devil does not have power where I am)
Abum nwa nke Chukwu (I am a Child of God)
Jesus nani gi ribe otuto (Jesus only you deserve the praise)
Onye inye aka, Chinwedum
(The one who helps me, the God who owns my life)
Onye nwem, Eze
(The one that owns me, King)
Jesus bu isi ike ndum o (The strength of my life)
