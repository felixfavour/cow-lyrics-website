If I stand or I should fall
You know me well, You see it all
My darkest nights, my deepest fears
I cry to You and You will hear
Boundless love, Come carry me
To the place where I at last I'm free
Where I belong and You will be
Where all of You is all of me
Boundless love, come carry me
In Your fullness, I will rest
I find Your peace beneath the cross
Knowing You, my one desire
Take me now to where You are
Here we stand now in Your name
You've changed our hearts, We're not the same
Your love has captured all we are
Oh Lamb of God, Sweet Morning Star
Where I belong and You will be
Where all of you is all of me
Boundless love, Come carry me
