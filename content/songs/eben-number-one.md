Always rising
Everywhere we are we are always shining
There's no limit
Everywhere we are we are always wining
The life I live is not by chance
Everywhere we are we taking over
We going up to the top
For the greater one lives in us
We number one
Oh we number one

We're the light of the world now
We're the saviour of the earth right now
We're the salt of the earth
We're the ones to show them how
The life I live is not by chance
Everywhere we are we taking over
We going up to the top
For the greater one lives in us
We number one
