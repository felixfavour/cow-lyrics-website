Await... I'm undone... I scarce... Can move...
Alone... Surrounded... Consumed... By You...
I need You to help me
Need You to help me breathe...
Woh-oh-oh-oh, I need You to help me breathe...
Oh... Woh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh, take me in
Oh... Woh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh, take me in
[X2]
Only a little bit closer
A little while longer in your arms
Take me a little bit deeper
You are life to my soul
[X2]
Oh... Woh-oh-oh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh, take me in
[Repeat several times]
