My Jesus I love Thee
I know Thou art mine
For thee all the follies of sin I resign
My gracious redeemer
My Savior art Thou
If ever I loved Thee
My Jesus 'tis now
I love Thee because Thou has first loved me
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus 'tis now
Tis now
In mansions of glory and endless delight
I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow
If ever I loved  Thee, my Jesus tis now
Tis now
My gracious Redeemer
MY Savior art Thou
If ever I loved Thee
My Jesus tis now
