Blessed Child Lyrics
Small boy from a small town
Hard dreams still dey run town (Too much)
All ein? peers been to downtime (All ein? peers been to downtime)
Now I tell them my story
They know I'm a blessed man
Mummy said I'm a blessed child
Yeah
I got, I got, I got the mark on me now
I got the mark on me now
My God, He no dey sleep now
I got, I got, I got the mark on me now
I got the mark on me now
My God, He no dey sleep now
So when they see Your grace on me
And when they see Your light on me
Because of Your hands on me
