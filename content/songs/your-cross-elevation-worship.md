My soul has come alive now
The grave has lost its grip on me
I'm free by the cross
I'm free
My shame is gone forever
The chains have lost their hold on me
I'm free by the cross
I'm free
Pre-chorus:
The blood of Jesus has now redeemed us
Chorus:
We lift our voices
We shout out louder
Jesus your cross has saved us
Our God has risen
Your power in us
Jesus your cross has saved us
Love awakened my heart
My eyes are open now I see
I'm free by the cross
I'm free
