What can I do with my obsession?
With the things I cannot see?
Is there madness in my being?
Is it the wind that blows the trees?
Sometimes You're further than the moon
Sometimes You're closer than my skin
And You surround me like a winter fog
You've come and burned me with a kiss
[Chorus: Jad Gillies]
And my heart burns for You
And my heart burns
And I'm so filthy with my sin
I carry pride like a disease
Oh, you know I'm stubborn, God, and I'm longing to be close
You burn me deeper than I know
And I feel lonely without hope
And I feel desperate without vision
You wrap around me like a winter coat
You come and free me like a bird
[Chorus: Brooke Ligertwood & Jad Gillies]
And my heart burns for You
And my heart burns for You
And my heart burns, oh, it burns, it burns for you
And my heart burns for You
