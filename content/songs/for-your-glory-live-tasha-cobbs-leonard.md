Lord if I
Find favor in Your sight
Lord please
Hear my hearts cry
I'm desperately waiting
To be where You are
I'll cross the hottest desert
I'll travel near or far
For Your glory
I will do anything
Just to see You
To behold You as my King
For Your glory
I will do anything
Just to see you
To behold You as my King
Lord if I
Find favor in Your sight
Lord please
Hear my hearts cry
I'm desperately waiting
To be where You are
I'll cross the hottest desert
I'll travel near or far
