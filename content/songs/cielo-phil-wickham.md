[Intro]
(Cielo, Cielo, Cielo, Cielo)
(Cielo, Cielo, Cielo, Cielo)
I'm walking through the bright white gates
Breathing in and out Your grace
All around me melodies rise
That echo with the joy inside
[Pre-Chorus]
So I start to sing
But I can't sing loud enough
I can't sing loud enough
When I'm singing for You, my God
No, I can't sing loud enough
I can't sing loud enough
When I'm singing for You, my God
With a thunder roll and a brilliant light
Your glory boasts and the Heavens shine
The saints and angels stand in awe
Captured by the beauty of it all
