In a poor shepherd's field, on that silent night
The Angel appeared, and dark turned to light
The Savior is born in Bethlehem
Wrapped as a spotless lamb
Gloria
So don't be afraid, I bring good news
Though you were lost, God came to you
Our Prince of peace, our only way
There in a manger lays
Gloria
Gloria, Gloria
In the highest, Gloria
The Son of God, the Savior has come
Our Messiah, here with us
Gloria
The word became flesh with us to dwell
God with a face, Emmanuel
On this holy night, for the world HÐµ so loved
Jesus was born for us
Gloria
