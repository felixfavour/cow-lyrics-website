When you feel the sunlight
Fade into the cold night
Don't know where to turn
I don't know where to turn
And all the dreams you're dreamin'
Seem to lose their meaning
Let me in your world
Baby, let me in your world
[Pre-Chorus]
All you need
Is someone you can hold
Don't be sad
You're not alone
I will be here for you
Somewhere in the night
Somewhere in the night
I'll shine a light for you (Shining)
Somewhere in the night
I'll be standin' by
I will be here for you
In this world of strangers
Of cold, unfriendly faces
Someone you can trust
Oh, there's someone you can trust
I will be your shelter
I'll give you my shoulder
Just reach out for my love
Reach out for my love
