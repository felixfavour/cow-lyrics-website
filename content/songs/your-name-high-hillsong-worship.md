[Intro]
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Your innocence forsaken
Upon that cross
You gave Yourself for us
Carried into Your freedom
Our broken past replaced in
A second chance
The chains have come undone
Death defied in the Father's love
We are living to make Your Name high
Jesus, living to make Your Name high
Jesus, You gave what the world couldn't offer us
Say what they want, say what they want
We are free, woah
The atmosphere is changing
Oh can You hear
The people rising up
In the hope of Your freedom
