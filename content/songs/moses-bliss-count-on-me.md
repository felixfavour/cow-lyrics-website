when you need someone to preach the word
when you need someone to take your presence to the world
Lord you can count on me
i understand those faithful deeds
Lord i won't let this gospel fall to the ground
Lord you can count on me
when you need a gold i will come
I'll do anything anything for you
Lord you can count on me
you can count on me(4)
Lord you can count on you(2) when you need someone to give life's meaning
when you need someone to shine your light in dark places
Lord you can count on me
when you need someone to be your outstretched arms
and take your liquid love to the people out the earth
Lord you can count on me
necessity is laid on me till every kneel bows i will never stop
Lord you can count on me
