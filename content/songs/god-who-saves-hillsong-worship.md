The light of the world
Shining in love
Taking the fall upon Your shoulders
You shattered the dark
As You rose to life again
You search all the earth
For those who are lost
And leaving the rescued for the fallen
You're leading us home
As we call upon Your Name
Chorus
You're the God who saves
You're the hope of all
Reaching out Your hand
As Your people call
Our Saviour has come
Let Your will be done
Your kingdom on earth as in the heavens
Our freedom is found
Lord in no other Name
