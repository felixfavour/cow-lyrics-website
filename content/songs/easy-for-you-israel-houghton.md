[Intro]
We believe there's nothing too hard, nothing too hard
Come on
It's easy for you, easy for you
What's impossible for me, You can do
It's easy for you, easy for you
What's impossible for me is easy for You
(All right)
I know You're working all things for me
You've never let me down, You never ever will
I know that mountains move when You speak
You can do anything, anything but fail
[Chorus
It's easy for you, easy for you
What's impossible for me, You can do
It's easy for you, easy for you
What's impossible for me is easy for You
(Do it again)
Oh...
You know the plans
