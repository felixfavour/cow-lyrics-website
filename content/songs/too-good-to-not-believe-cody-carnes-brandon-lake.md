I've lived stories that have proved Your faithfulness
I've seen miracles my mind can't comprehend
And there is beauty in what I can't understand
Jesus, it's You, Jesus, it's You
[Chorus: Cody Carnes]
I believe
You're the wonder-working God
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Too good to not believe, oh-oh
And I can't resurrect a man with my own hands
But just the mention of Your name can raise the dead, yeah
All the glory to the only One who can
Jesus, it's You, Jesus, it's You (
Come on
)
[Chorus: Brandon Lake & Cody Carnes]
Oh, I believe
You're the wonder-working God (Yes, You are)
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not believe (Too good)
Too good to not believe (Come on)
Too good to not believe
After everything I've seen (After everything I've seen)
You're too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Too good to not believe (After everything I've seen You do)
(Oh, God)
Yes, I believe (I believe, I believe it)
Oh, I believe, ooh-ooh
