For we know the truth
Your truth has set us free
In Your Name alone
We have been released
You are here with us
You are here with us
We are slaves no more
Freedom is our hope
Never looking back
Jesus You are Lord
We give all to You
We give all to You
Chorus
Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
Chains are broken eyes are open
Christ is with us
Christ is with us
Who the Son has freed
He is free indeed
All our sin is gone
We have been redeemed
Jesus paid it all
Jesus paid it all
