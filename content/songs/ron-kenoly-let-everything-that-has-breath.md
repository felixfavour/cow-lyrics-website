Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord
And let the living proclaim
Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord
Let every instrument
Sound His praise
As all His people adore
Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
I will open up my mouth
And He will fill it with praise
I will magnify His name
The name that stands
Above all names is Jesus
High sounding cymbals
And trumpets of brass
The sound of one accord
Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
My Lord has put
A new song in my heart
It's a song of praise to my God
And everyone who
Hears it will rejoice
Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
