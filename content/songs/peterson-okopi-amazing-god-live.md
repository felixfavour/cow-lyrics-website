you created the language for the deaf,yet you talk to the and they hear, you're amazing.
you created the pathway for the blind yet you lead them and they honour you, you're amazing.
Only you who swallows up,what swallows and elephant you're a Mystery
So this is my conclusion:  Nobody can bear the name you bear.
No body can wear the crown you wear.
Nobody can Enter the place you enter.
Speaks in tongue.
No body can bear the name you bear,
Nobody can wear the crown you wear,
No body can enter the place you enter,
speaks in tongues .
Nobody ,nobodyeeee
nobody nobodyeee
nobody can bear the name you bear
nobody can wear the crown you wear
nobody can enter the place you enter.
lift up your hands(speaks in tongue).x3
Nobody can turn water to wine
who can cross red sea to part?
who will enter the place you enter?
Nobody can turn water to wine
can feed 5thousand ,with a loaf of bread and 2 fishes.
You are not elected, there's no impeachment x2
you are my God,ashakaba(speaks in tongue)
you're not elected ,there can never be an impeachment for your sake, you're not elected, you're my God.
The one who drives on the wheel of the wind
the one who drives on the wheel of the wind.
ojiri nkata kuru mmiri,you are my God.
The one who drives on the wheel of the wind ojiri nkata kuru mmiri, you're my God .
