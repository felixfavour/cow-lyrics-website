Yeah
The sparrow’s not worried ‘bout tomorrow
Or the troubles to come
The lily’s not thinking ‘bout the seasons
The drought or the flood
The tree that’s planted by the water
Isn’t fazed by the fire, uh
So why should I be?
Yeah
'Cause You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
And You hold me in Your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in Your love no matter what the future brings
Ah, You take good carе of me
The sun’s not worried ‘bout thе winter
‘Cause soon it will pass
The light’s not thinking ‘bout the darkness
Or the shadow it casts
A heart that’s planted in forgiveness
Doesn’t dwell in the past
So why should I be?
