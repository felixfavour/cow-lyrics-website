On the edge, of a cliff
Nothing below but tragedy
At the end, of my self
Nowhere to go
But down from here
I feel the weight
I feel the tug
Of my sins
And gravity keeps pulling me down
And I deserve it
But Your hand blocked the ground
Chorus
I fell in looove
Fell in looove
Fell in looove
Fell in looove
What is love?
Nothing's right
Take a look, no fantasy
In my world, in this life
Nowhere to go but down from here
