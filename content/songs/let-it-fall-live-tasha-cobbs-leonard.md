[Intro]
Woo
Come on, it's a song of intercession
All of these songs we keep singing
All of this praise we keep bringing, yeah
When it's all said and done, yeah
We just want You to come, hey!
These hands we keep raising
These prayers we keep praying, oh
When it's all said and done, yeah
We just want You to come
[Pre-Chorus]
So here's our prayer, Lord
Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall
Let Your glory fall
Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall
Let Your glory fall, hey!
We don't need lights, camera, action, woo
We are just longing for Your presence, yeah
'Cause when it's all said and done
We just want You to come, ah
