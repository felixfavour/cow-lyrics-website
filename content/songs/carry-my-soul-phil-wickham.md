[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh (Hmm, mm)
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
I wanna hear You say, "Well done"I wanna be welcomed in
I wanna feel Your love like sunshine on my resurrected skin
[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hear the music play
I wanna hear the trumpets sound
I wanna hear You call my name and watch my feet lift off the ground
I will run, oh, and I won't quit
Chasing Your heart, just like David did
I'll come runnin' through the gates, lookin' to Your face
Oh, I can hardly wait
Until You carry my soul, carry my soul away
[Hook]
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
