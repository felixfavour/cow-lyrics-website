Wandering the road of desperate life
Aimlessly beneath the barren sky
Leave it to Me, I'll lead you home
So afraid that you will not be found
It won't be long before your sun goes down
Just leave it to Me, I'll lead you home
Hear Me calling, hear Me calling
Just leave it to Me
I'll lead you home
A troubled mind and a doubter's heart
You wonder how you ever got this far
Leave it to Me, I'll lead you home
Vultures of darkness ate the crumbs you left
And you got no way to retrace your steps
Just leave it to Me, I'll lead you home
Hear Me calling, hear Me calling
You're lost and alone
Leave it to Me, I'll lead you home
Hear Me calling, hear Me calling
You're lost and alone
Leave it to Me, I'll lead you home
