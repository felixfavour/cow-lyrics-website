With every step I take
And every move I make
My consciousness and all of my unconsciousness in you
Well I'll be damned
To second guess
No halts or regrets
And I'm fully, I'm fully sold out to you
And my hope
My hope is in you
Alone
And if you look me well
It is written all over me
I can't fold my arms
They're wide o, they're wide open for your embrace
And I cannot stress enough
You have no rival
None is your equal
And I can't make no sense of any if you ain't here
O yo mi o yo mi o
O to mi o to mi o
You complete me
You're more than enough for me
You have no rival
None is your equal
And I can't make no sense of any if you ain't here
O yo mi o yo mi o
O to mi o to mi o
You complete me
You're more than enough for me
Kada raka
Jesu mo mi o
My jealous lover yeah
Oh special is what I am to you
Irreplaceable is how you make me feel
You make me feel something so real
And my hope
My hope is in you
Alone
And if you look me well
It is written all over me
I can't fold my arms
They're wide o, they're wide open for your embrace
And I cannot stress enough
You have no rival
None is your equal
And I can't make no sense of any if you ain't here
O yo mi o yo mi o
O to mi o to mi o
You complete me
You're more than enough for me
You have no rival
None is your equal
And I can't make no sense of any if you ain't here
O yo mi o yo mi o

You complete me
You're more than enough for me ah yeah yeah
