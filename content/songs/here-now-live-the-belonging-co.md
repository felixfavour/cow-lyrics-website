Here now, Your presence is here now
All around, I feel You all around
So rain down, Spirit come rain down
There's no doubt Your glory will pour out, yeah
(Oh, pour it out, pour Your Spirit out)
(Pour Your Spirit out)
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're ready, Jesus, we're ready
We're waiting, anticipating
The veil is torn in two
What's dead is now made new
The empty grave is proof
That You're living in me, Your presence in me
Your Spirit breathing life
Heaven is open wide
This freedom is a sign
That You're living in mе, Your presence in mе
Oh, Your presence in me
So let hope rise, let hope rise
Oh, the fire in His eyes
Now burning on the inside
