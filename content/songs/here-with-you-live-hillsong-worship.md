When the sunlight breaks
And the day has just begun
In the still I wait for Your voice to lead me on
[Pre-Chorus]
Eternity residing in my soul, oh
I follow You til the day You call me home
Here now with You
I have heaven in me
Everything’s changed
And I will never be without You
Without You
From the dust I’m made
With Your calling on my life
And Your plan weaved
Into the fabric of my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
Eternity residing in my soul, oh
I lift my eyes to the One who gave it all
I lift my eyes to the One who gave it all
