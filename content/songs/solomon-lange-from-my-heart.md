This Melody Yo, yo, yo, yo
Is Coming from my Heart
Is Coming from my Heart
Please take this Praise Yo, yo, yo, yo
An Offering unto You
Let it Please Your Heart
This Melody Yo, yo, yo, yo
Is Coming from my Heart
Is Coming from my Heart
Please take this Praise Yo, yo, yo, yo
An Offering unto You
Let it Please Your Heart
It was December, I still remember
When the Preacher man
Gave out the Call
We were not many
That Responded to the Call
I was so Young
But I was Led that night to Jesus
Through Tough Times
And through dark nights
You've been here
Giving me the Victory
You are my Father
My Way Maker, all my Praise
Belong to you

{This Melody Yo, yo, yo, yo
Is Coming from my Heart
Is Coming from my Heart
Please take this Praise Yo, yo, yo, yo
My Offering unto You
Let it Please Your Heart} [x2]
From My Heart  Solomon Lange Lyrics
Forces are Prepared for War
But Victory is for the Lord Alone
Who says a thing
And it come to Pass
When Jehovah have not Commanded
Greater is He who Lives in me
Than he who who is in the World
For the Victory over sin and death
Na kawo ka ma Godiya

{This Melody Yo, yo, yo, yo
Is Coming from my Heart
Is Coming from my Heart
Please take this Praise Yo, yo, yo, yo
My Offering unto You
Let it Please Your Heart} [x4]
