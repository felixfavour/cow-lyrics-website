For God so loved this world
He gave His Only Son
That whoever would believe would never die
For God so loved this world
He gave His Only Son
That whoever would believe would never die
[Pre-Chorus]
Hmm, the scars of love are upon His hands (Upon His hands)
We watch the darkness flee at His command
He reigns over Heaven
Oh, He reigns over Earth
[Hook]
Who is this King?
Oh, who is this King?
Yeah, His Name is Jesus
His Name is Jesus
He's the light of the world
And there's freedom in His name
Awesome in power
Reigning forever
The light of the world
And there's freedom in His name
