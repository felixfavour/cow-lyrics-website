Together in this place of worship
Your greatness we proclaim
We stand as one in giving You
All glory and acclaim
[Pre-Chorus 1]
To You our hearts are open
To You our hands we raise
Come take the place of honour in our lives
Emmanuel
Our God is with us
Prince of Peace Mighty One
The everliving God
See the praises of our Saviour
Rise to open skies
With the dawning of redemption
Your glory will arise
[Pre-Chorus 2]
For You alone are worthy
Here in Zion You are praised
Our Lord and King forev–µr You will reign
