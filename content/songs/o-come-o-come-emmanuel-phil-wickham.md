[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel (Oh, oh, oh)
Shall come to Thee, O Israel!
[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
O come, Thou Day-Spring, come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine Advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight (Oh)
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel (Oh, oh, oh)
Shall come to Thee, O Israel!
