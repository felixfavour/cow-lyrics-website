I know
That worship is about the song You want to hear
Not the one I want to sing
I'm here so You can sing over me
And I'll sing it back to You
I know
That worship is about the song You want to hear
Not the one I want to sing
Jesus, I'm here so You can sing over me
And I'll sing it back to You
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I worship in spirit and truth (Shaba)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh)
I worship in spirit and truth
Oh Lord my God
How great You are
You are more than words can say
More than what my mind can grasp
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh)
I worship in spirit and truth
