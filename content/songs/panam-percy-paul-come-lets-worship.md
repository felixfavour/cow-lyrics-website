there something wrong with you brother
You never come with us anymore
We would love to share it with you
What is the matter lately sister
You never say hello anymore
No replies to our many calls
We have been together too long to pretend
Sharing our love is what we have promised to do
Jesus prayed to the Father He said
Lord make them one as We are one
Come
Let's  worship together
Come let us  praise the Lord
Come let us  lift up our voices to the Lord
We have come to share your problems
We have come to bear your burdens
We would show the world we are the children of the Lord
(Come on together) Come
Let's worship together
Come let us praise the Lord
Come let us lift up our voices to the Lord
We have come to share your problems
We have come to bear your burdens
We would show the world we are the children of the Lord
