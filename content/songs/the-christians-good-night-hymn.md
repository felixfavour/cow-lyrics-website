Sleep On, Beloved, Sleep And Take Thy Rest;
Lay Down Thy Head Upon Thy Savior’s Breast;
We Love Thee Well, But Jesus Loves Thee Best
Good-Night! Good-Night! Good-Night!

Calm Is Thy Slumber As An Infant’s Sleep;
But Thou Shalt Wake No More To Toil And Weep;
Thine Is A Perfect Rest, Secure And Deep
Good-Night! Good-Night! Good-Night!

Until The Shadows From This Earth Be Cast,
Until He Gathers In His Sheaves At Last;
Until The Twilight Gloom Be Overpast
Good-Night! Good-Night! Good-Night!

Until The Easter Glory Lights The Skies,
And The Dead In Jesus Shall Arise,
And He Shall Come, But Not In Lowly Guise
Good-Night! Good-Night! Good-Night!

Until Made Beautiful By Love Divine,
Thou, In The Likeness Of Thy Lord Shalt Shine,
And He Shall Bring That Golden Crown Of Thine:
Good-Night! Good-Night! Good-Night!

Only “Good-Night,” Beloved, Not “Farewell!”
A Little While, And All His Saints Shall Dwell
In Hallowed Union Indivisible
Good-Night! Good-Night! Good-Night!

Until We Meet Again Before His Throne,
Clothed In The Spotless Robe He Gives His Own,
Until We Know Even As We Are Known
Good-Night! Good-Night! Good-Night!
