Crown him the son of righteousness
Crown him the king above all of kings
Let the nations declare He is Lord
Sing Emanuel, the savior is born
He shall become a wonderful counselor, everlasting one
He shall become Jesus the savior, peace to earth has come
We worship and adore him, the Lord
Jesus the son of God, he reigns
Forever his kingdom will not fail
God almighty, in justice he comes
Sing Emanuel, great is his love
He shall become a wonderful counselor, everlasting one
He shall become Jesus the savior, peace to earth has come
We worship and adore him, the Lord
Unto us His love has come
Unto us Christ is born
Now to Him be the glory and all the praise
Unto us His love has come
Unto us Christ is born
Now to Him be the glory and all the praise
Now to Him be the glory and all the praise
Now to Him be the glory and all the praise
