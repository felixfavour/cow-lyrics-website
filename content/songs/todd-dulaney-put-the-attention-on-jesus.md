It's amazing how we've gone after the show.
How we hardly say His name anymore
I think it's strange how we love to jump and shout
But never want to tell the world what it's about
I'm amazed that the One who gave His life
Is not the feature of every single night
I think it's sad how the man that paid the price
Is being drowned out by all the fluff and lights
Let's put the attention back where it belongs
Back upon the Son, He is the One who died for us
Let's put the attention back upon the Cross,
Back upon the Lord, He is the King, He's why we sing
Put the attention on Jesus
Cause that's where it belongs
Put the attention on Jesus! (Everybody say yeah)
Yeah yeah
Put the attention on Jesus
Cause that's where it belongs
Put the attention on Jesus!
Yeah yeah
If I be lifted up from all the earth
I'll draw all men unto me
If I be lifted up from all the earth
I'll draw all men unto me
If I be lifted up from all the earth
I'll draw all men unto me
If I be lifted up from all the earth
I'll draw all!
Put the attention on Jesus
Forever we lift You up
Put the attention on Jesus!
Yeah yeah
Put the attention on Jesus
Forever we lift You up
Put the attention on Jesus! (Everybody say yeah)
Yeah yeah
