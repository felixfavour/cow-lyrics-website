"Holy Forever"
(feat. Jenn Johnson)
A thousand generations falling down in worship
To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
And all who've gone before us and all who will believe
Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
Your Name is the highest, Your Name is the greatest
Your Name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions, all powers and positions
Your Name stands above them all
And the angels cry holy
All creation cries holy
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever
If you've been forgiven and if you've been redeemed
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
And if you walk in freedom, if you bear His Name
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
Sing the song forever and amen
With all the angels cry holy
All creation cries holy
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever
Hear Your people sing holy
And to the King of kings, holy
And You will always be holy
Holy forever
Oh 'cause Your Name is the highest, Your Name is the greatest
Your Name stands above them all
Above all thrones and dominions, and all powers and positions
Your Name stands above them all
Oh Jesus
Your Name is the highest, Your Name is the greatest
Your Name, oh it stands above them all
Above all thrones and dominions, and all powers and positions
Your Name, oh it stands above them all
And the angels cry holy
And all creation cries holy
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever, hey
Hear Your people sing holy
And to the King of kings, holy
And You will always be holy
Holy forever
You will always be holy
Holy forever
