Lord, I'm really glad You're here
I hope you feel the same when You see all my fear
And how I fail
I fall sometimes
It's hard to walk on shifting sand
I miss the rock, and find I have nowhere left to stand
I start to cry
Lord, please help me raise my hands so You can pick me up
Hold me close
Hold me tighter
I have found a place where I can hide
It's safe inside Your arms of love
Like a child who's helped throughout a storm
You keep me warm in Your arms of love
Storms will come and storms will go
Wonder just how many storms it takes until I finally know
You're here always
Even when my skies are far from gray
I can stay
Teach me to stay there
