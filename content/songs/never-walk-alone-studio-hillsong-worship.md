Your heart is for me
Your ear is listening
I'm safe in Your love
Your army of angels watch over me
You're always present
You're always with me
For all of my life
Your favor has followed
You're my covering
I have never walked alone
I've never been abandoned
You are my inheritance
You are my strength and shield
And I have confidence
You go before me
You're my deliverеr
I know I never walk alone
You'rе always faithful
You're strong and able
I'm lifting my head
In You, I find help
You're my providence
