I have found here
Love and mercy
From an infinite supply
I have found here
Living water
From a well that won't run dry
At Your feet
I bow in wonder
At Your feet
I place my crowns
Let surrender be the only sound
At Your feet
I lay me down
Fear and failure
Pride and hatred
You see all I've tried to hide
But sweet mercy
Has embraced me
Wrath has turned to life divine
At Your feet
I bow in wonder
At Your feet
I place my crowns
Let surrender be the only sound
At Your feet
I lay me down
