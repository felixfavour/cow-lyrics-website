I want blue, blue, blue wine
Said that you needed some more healing time
Come drink the bluest of wines
Complex disposition I'm aquamarine
Navy at noon, ocean all in-between
Smoke screen cinema, gases in the air
Scars fully on show just to show that we care
A car with flat tyres is one that we steer
A lie before the truth is still one that we hear
One missing piece, there's never no peace
Iron out a map that's designed with the crease
Wanna paint the town red
I'm scared of the shade
10 Years down the line and the pain still ain't decayed
You and I darling are somewhat the same
Frostbitten hearts, so we both can't hold a flame
Our mirrors cracked up in a similar shape
The beauty in the broken
Is sweet like a grape
Overindulgence is killing us slow
Opposites attract, but we're breaking the mould
The others see rust, I see only gold
I see an A4 sheet that's been ready to fold
I see a mortal that's scared of the cold
Become an angel that's made a home in the snow
Oh I want blue, blue, blue wine
Said that you needed some more healing time
Come drink the bluest of wines
