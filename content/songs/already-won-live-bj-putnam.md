[Refrain]
Hallelu, hallelu (hallelujah, woooh)
Hallelujah, hallelu
Our God is higher
Above Him none
No one beside Him
Not even one
[Pre-Chorus 1]
When fear is rushing in
And darkness comes
Let us remember He already won
In Jesus we triumph
Our God has overcome
Forever the Savior
He has already won
[Refrain]
Hallelu, hallelu (hallelujah, hallelujah)
Hallelujah, hallelu
Our King has spoken
And that's enough
True to His promises
Every last one
