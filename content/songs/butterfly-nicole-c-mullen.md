Not yet a woman and certainly not a child
But I was caught somewhere in the middle
On that one Friday afternoon
And I, I remember mama saying, "It's time for you to go
Go out on and change the world and become
All that you have dreamed of"
And as the tears that she was crying
Fell from her face and shoulders she said
"Don't forget who you are child, where you
Come from, where you're goin'
'Cause I'm always gonna be here for you
Fighting in your corner
So with every bow you take
Take one for those that came before you"
(Chorus)
Fly, Fly Butterfly Fly
Stand upon these two shoulders of mine
Spread those wings of yours and fly
Now I'm a woman and I've got a child
And I can't believe the day's gonna come
When she tells me that it's time to soar
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
Not sure what I'm gonna tell her
Maybe don't forget who you are child
Where you come from, where you're going
'Cause I'm always gonna be here for you
Fighting in your corner
So with every bow you take
Take one for those that came before ya
