Blessed are those who dwell in Your house
They are ever praising You
Blessed are those whose strength is in You
Whose hearts are set on our God
[Instrumental]
Blessed are those who dwell in Your house
They are ever praising You
Blessed are those whose strength is in You
Whose hearts are set on our God
Blessed are those who dwell in Your house
They are ever praising You
Blessed are those whose strength is in You
Whose hearts are set on our God
[Pre-Chorus]
We will go from strength to strength
Until we see You face to face
Hear our prayer
Oh, Lord, God almighty
Come bless our land
As we seek You, worship You
