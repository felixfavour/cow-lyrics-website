The God who made the winters and the summers
The One who put the stars all in their place
The only One who stands above all others
And He knows me by name
The angels hide their faces in His presence
The demons run for cover when You speak
You rule the world and reign above the heavens
And still draw close to me
[Pre-Chorus]
And when I close my eyes
I know that
I'm not just hoping
I'm not just wishing
I know I'm praying
To a God who listens
I know He hears me
I know He's living
Yes, I am praying
To a God who listens
He walks with me and leads me by still waters
I lay my troubles down at His feet
It's amazing that the Savior and the Father
He is a friend to me
How can it be, oh?
