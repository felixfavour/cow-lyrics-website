Made a way
Don't know how but You did it
Made a way
Standing here not knowing how we'll get through this test
But holding unto faith You know that
Nothing can catch You by surprise
You got this figured out and You're watching us now
But when it looks as if we can't win
You wrap us in Your arm and step in
And everything we need You supply
You got this in control
And now we know that
You made a way
When our backs were against the wall
And it looked as if it was over
You made a way
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way
You made a way
And now we're here
Looking back on where we come from
Because of You and nothing we've done
To deserve the love and mercy You've shown
But Your grace was strong enough to pick us up
And You made a way
When our backs were against the wall
And it looked as if it was over
Lord You made a way
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way
You made a way
When our backs were against the wall
And it looked as if it was over
Lord You made a way
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way
And you move mountains
You cause walls to fall
With Your power
You perform miracles
There is nothing that's impossible
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way
You move mountains
You cause walls to fall
With Your power
Perform miracles
There is nothing that's impossible
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way
You move mountains
You cause walls to fall
With Your power
Perform miracles
There is nothing that's impossible
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way
You made a way
You made a way
You made a way
You made a way
Don't know how but you did it
Made a way
Don't know how but you did it
Made a way
Don't know how but you did it
Don't know how but you did it
Don't know how but you did it
Don't know how but you did it
Don't know how but you did it
Don't know why but I'm grateful
Don't know why but I'm grateful
Don't know why but I'm grateful
Don't know why but I'm grateful
Don't know why but I'm grateful
Don't know why but I'm grateful
And we're standing here
Only because You made
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way
And we're standing here
Only because You made
'Cause You move mountains
You move mountains
You move mountains
You move mountains
And You cause walls to fall
You cause walls to fall
You cause walls to fall
You cause walls to fall
And You cause chains to break
You cause chains to break
You cause chains to break
You cause chains to break
And giants fall
Giants fall
Giants fall
Giants fall
'Cause you move mountain
You move mountain
And everything is easy for you
'Cause you move mountain
Yes you move mountain
Mountains are moving
Mountains are moving
Mountains are moving
Mountains are moving
Strong holds are breaking now
Strong holds are breaking now
Strong holds are breaking
Strong holds are breaking
'Cause you move mountain
You cause walls to fall
With your power
With your power
With your power
With your power
You perform miracles
You perform miracles
You perform miracles
You perform miracles
My son is breathing
My son is living
My son is breathing
My son is living
When the doctor said no
You said yes
When the doctor said no
You said yes
When they pronounced me dead
You said not yet
When they pronounced me dead
You said not yet
You perform miracles
You perform miracles
