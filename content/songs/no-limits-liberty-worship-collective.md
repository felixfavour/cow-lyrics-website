What can wash away my sins?
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
Oh, hallelujah
What can heal me from my past?
What can make me free at last?
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
Oh, hallelujah
Your grace has no boundaries
Your mercy is endless
Your love has no limits
Your love has no limits
You keep on pursuing
Your heart is relentless
Your love has no limits
Your love has no limits
Who can open any grave?
Who calls the dead to life again?
Oh, no one but my God
Oh, no one but my God
Oh, hallelujah
