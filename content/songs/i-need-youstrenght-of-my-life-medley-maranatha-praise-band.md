Lord, look upon my need
I need You, I need You
Oh Lord, have mercy now on me
Forgive me, oh Lord, forgive me
And I will be clean
Lord, look upon my need
I need You, I need You
Oh Lord, have mercy now on me
Forgive me, oh Lord, forgive me
And I will be clean
Oh Lord, you are familiar with my ways
There is nothing hid from You
Oh Lord, you know the number of my days
I want to live my life for You
Lord have mercy now on me
Forgive me, Oh Lord, forgive me
And I will be clean
Every day, I look to You
To be the strength of my life
You're the hope I hold onto
Be the strength of my life
