I'm chasing after you no matter what I have to do
Cause I need you more and more
I'm chasing after you no matter what I have to do
Cause I need you more and more
I'm chasing
(I'm chasing after you)
No matter what I
(No matter what I have to do)
Cause I need you, more, more and more
(Cause I need you more and more)
Everbody make it louder
I'm chasing after you
(I'm chasing after you)
No matter what
(No matter what i have to do)
Cause I need you
(Cause I need you more and more)
C'mon, say more and more
(More and more)
I need you more and more Jesus, more and more
(More and more)
More and more
(More and more)
I need you more and more
(More and more)
