Give thanks to the Lord our God and King
His love endures forever
For he is good
He is above all things
His love endures forever
Sing praise sing praise
Forever God is faithful
Forever God is strong
Forever God is with us
Forever forever
From the rising to the setting
Of the sun
His love endures forever
By the grace of God
We will carry on
His love endures forever
Sing praise sing praise
