Are you hurting and broken within?
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
Jesus is calling
Have you come to the end of yourself
Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
Jesus is calling
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
Come today, there's no reason to wait
Jesus is calling
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes, a new life is born
Jesus is calling (oh, oh)
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
Savior
What a Savior
Oh, what a Savior
Isn't He wonderful?
Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen
Bow down before Him
For He is Lord of all
Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen
Oh, what a Savior
Isn't He wonderful?
Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen
Bow down before Him
For He is Lord of all
Sing Hallelujah, Christ is risen
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ (oh-oh)
Bear your cross as you wait for the crown
Tell the world of the treasure you found
