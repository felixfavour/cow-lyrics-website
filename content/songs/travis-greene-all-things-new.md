Past has held you long enough
But I am drawing you with love
Here now, pouring out my spirit,
receive it all
Shame has followed long enough
In this moment it's backing up
Here now, pouring out my spirit,
receive it all
I'm making all things new
Freeing you from you (Woo)
Here comes freedom now
( Guilt has) Guilt has come to weigh you down
(But where I am) But where I am,
freedom is found
(Here now) Here now, pouring out,
my spirit, receive it all
Fear brought chains to keep you bound
(In this moment) In this moment,
you're breaking out
Here now, pouring out, my spirit,
receive it all
Making all things new,
freeing you from you
Here comes Freedom,
I am making all things new
This love enough, yeah,
I am making all things new
Here comes Freedom (Yeah),
(I am) I am making all things new
(This love) This love (enough) enough,
I am making all things new
[Bridge]
Freedom's here, it's breaking the back
What's been holding you?
Sing over us together
No shame can stay, no charge remain
I am making all things new
Your guilty stains are washed away
I am making all things new
No shame can stay, no charge remain
I am (Hey) making all things new
Your guilty stains are washed away
I am making all things new
(Come on, receive it)
(No shame) No shame can stay,
no charge remain
I am making all things new
Your guilty stains are washed away
(Yeah, yeah)
(Sing) I am making all things new
No shame can stay, no charge remain
I am making all things new
(Your guilty stains)
Your guilty stains are washed away
I am making all things new
[Outro]
Here comes freedom,
(I am) I am making all things new
This love enough,
I am making all things new
Here comes freedom,
I am making all things new
This love enough,
I am making all things new
And I'm good at it, love to do it, I am
The past is gone, the future awaits
Now the past is gone,
and the future awaits
The past is gone, the future awaits
