Jesus
When I call Your name
I feel You drawing nearer
Jesus
You will never change
Your love remains forever
Jesus
In You I live and move and have my being
You're the reason
L stand, and shout
I'm living to sing of this love I have
And make, a sound
I'm living to give all I am to shine
Your light, around
Your the beating heart inside of me
And Jesus You're my motivation
You're my motivation
Jesus You're my motivation
Jesus
You have made me glad
Your joy is taking over
Jesus
There's no turning back
Now I am dancing in Your
Freedom
In You I live and move and have my being
You're the reason
