[Intro: Travis Greene]
Father, we choose
Not to look at the wind
Not to look at the waves
But to keep our eyes fixed on You
You're so good
Forever good
Amazing love
That welcomes me
The kindness of mercy
That bought with blood
Wholeheartedly
My soul undeserving
[Chorus: Kristian Stanfill & All]
Oh God, You're so good
Oh God, You're so good
Oh God, You're so good
You're so good to me
Yes, You are, yes, You are
You are so good to me
Always have been, always will be
Hmmm-hmm
Behold the cross
Age to age
And hour by hour
Because of You, God
The dead are raised
The sinner saved
The work of Your power (yeah)
Woah
