Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)

On the old rugged cross
You bled and you died for me
On the old rugged cross
You paid a heavy price for me

Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)

What is man that you’re mindful of
Who am I that you’re mindful of
What is man that you’re mindful of
Who am I that you’re mindful of


Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)

When I look back over my life
I see your hand, I see your glory
When I look back over my life
I see your goodness all around

Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)

Oh! I’m bought with the price of the blood
What you’ve done for me
My mouth can’t tell it all

Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
Ah ah ah ah
Ihe I na-emere m di mma (what you do for me is good)
