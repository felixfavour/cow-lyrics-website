For some who don't understand our purpose
And may not understand our prayers
We as a family in Jesus name
Would like to tell you the reason why we sing
Family
Someone asked a question
Why do we sing?
When we lift our hands to Jesus
What do we really mean?
Someone may be wondering
When we sing our song
At times we may be crying
And nothing's even wrong
I sing because I'm happy (I sing)
I sing because I'm free (His eye's on)
His eye's on the sparrow (that's the reason)
That's the reason why I sing
Glory, hallelujah (You're the reason)
You're the reason why I sing (come on, say glory)
Glory, hallelujah (thank you Jesus)
You're the reason why I sing
