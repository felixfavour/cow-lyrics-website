Would you believe me
Would you listen if I told you that
There is a love that makes a way
And never holds us back
Pre chorus:
So won't you break free
Won't you break free
Get up and dance in His love
Love never ending
Who would have thought that
God would give His one and only Son
Taking a stand upon the cross
To show us perfect love
Chorus:
There's no escaping the truth
No mistaking it's You
God forever we'll get up and dance
Get up and dance and praise You
There's no escaping Your light
No mistaking Your life
Across the world we will get up and dance
Get up and dance and praise You
