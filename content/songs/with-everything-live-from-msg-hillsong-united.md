[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (There's nothing the enemy)
Oh-oh-oh (Is afraid of more than the sound of a church that's united)
Oh-oh (The people), oh-oh (One voice, one heart)
Oh-oh-oh (One body)
Oh-oh-oh (One King)
Oh-oh (One High Priest and Saviour)
Oh-oh (One God above all)
Oh-oh-oh (So if you've got the voice)
Oh-oh-oh (Now's the time to use it, so come on lift it up, we sing)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh (I'll tell you we've been singing this for a long time)
Oh-oh-oh (But we haven't ever sung it in this room)
Oh-oh-oh (So let's let this ceiling and the city and God know, come on)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Come on)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Come on)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (For all that He's done)
Oh-oh-oh (For all that He's doing, for all that He's promised to do)
Oh-oh-oh (Can we lift our voice and sing)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (To Him who was and is and ever will be?)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (With everything we've got)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Can we sing, our hearts, they cry)
