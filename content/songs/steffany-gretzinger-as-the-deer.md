As the deer panteth for the water
so my soul longeth after thee
You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee
You alone are my strength my shield
To you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
and I long to worship thee
...
You're my friend and you are my brother even though you are a king
and I love you more than any other so much more than anything
You alone are my strength my shield
Yo you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee
...
How I long to worship thee
yeah
You alone are my strength my shield
To you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my strength my shield
To you alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee
I am longing...
yeah...
I am longing...
I am longing...
