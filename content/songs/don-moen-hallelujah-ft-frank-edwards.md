A million miles above the sky
Angels bow before Your throne
You're God and God alone
That is the song they've been singing
All creation call You holy
Even now we bow before You
Worthy worthy worthy
Is the Lamb upon the throne
Hallelu hallelujah
We lift our voice to praise Your name
Hallelu hallelujah
Heaven and earth adore You Lord
Hallelu hallelujah
We lift our voice to praise Your name
Hallelu hallelujah
Heaven and earth adore You Lord
You're highly lifted up
And Your glory fills this temple
As we lift our voice in praise
Come and dwell among Your people
Holy holy holy
Is the Lord God Almighty
Worthy worthy worthy
Is the Lamb upon the throne
Hallelu hallelujah
We lift our voice to praise Your name
Hallelu hallelujah
Heaven and earth adore You Lord
Hallelu hallelujah
We lift our voice to praise Your name
Hallelu hallelujah
Heaven and earth adore You Lord
Hallelu hallelujah
We lift our voice to praise Your name
Hallelu hallelujah
Heaven and earth adore You Lord
Hallelu hallelujah
We lift our voice to praise Your name
Hallelu hallelujah
