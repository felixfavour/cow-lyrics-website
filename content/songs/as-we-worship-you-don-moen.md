AS WE WORSHIP YOU
Key of D ascended to Key of F
As we worship You, let all the world come and see
How the mercy we received from You can set them free
As we worship You, let all this joy that fills our hearts
Bring a hunger and a hope to those who strayed so far
Chorus
As we bow in adoration and stand in reverent awe
Show Your majesty and glory, let Your anointing fall
As we declare Your name Lord Jesus as the only name who saves
May the power of Your salvation fill each heart we pray
As we worship You, let all the nations hear our song
Song of Jesus and His blood that proved His love for all
As we worship You, may all the lost and broken come
May they hear Your still small voice call out their names each one
(Repeat Chorus)
(then ascend to Key of F for Verse I and Chorus)
Verse 1 (ascended)
As we worship You, let all the world come and see
How the mercy we received from You can set them free
As we worship You, let all this joy that fills our hearts
Bring a hunger and a hope to those who strayed so far
