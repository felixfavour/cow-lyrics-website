The Heavens declare Your glory
Your Grace is now my story
Oh, oh, oh, everywhere I go I see You
And You're beautiful
Let the world know
Gotta let the world know
[x2]
The sun, the moon, the stars creation testifies
The greatness of our God in Your graffiti skies
Forever and ever
Your Grace goes on and on, on and on
The Heavens declare Your glory
Your Grace is now my story
Oh, oh, oh, everywhere I go I see You
And You're beautiful
Let the world know
Gotta let the world know
[x2]
Your love is so, so good it makes me wanna scream
This life I found in You, more than I've ever dreamed
