Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me
I was lost but He brought me in
His love for me
Free at last, He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Yes, He died for me
Who the Son sets free
Oh, is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes, I am
Free at last, He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Yes, He died for me
