I've seen rain it's been dark
I've felt pain got this scars
sometimes it's all I can remember
where the sun give me light got to be more to life
I can't lie it's been colder than December
But when it comes to survival
there's only one friend that I know
That I can truly depend on
I know
The way that you love me
The way that you love me
It's everything I need do never let me go
The way that you that you told me
that you'll always be
everything I need
do never let me go
do never let me go
Time to break lose my mind
Wanna scream
wanna cry
help me Father say I need you now more than ever
coz I'm contemplated,
I'm turning back ,
I feel like saying it's alright but I can't handle all that act so I surrender lord.
....so if you've been through what I've been through
you know exactly what God can do that's the reason I'll sing this time.To never let me go.
The way that you love me
The way that you love me
do never let me go....
do never let me go
I want you forever
I need you forever
stay with me forever
Truth is that I really need you every hour
The way that you love me
Do never let me go
