I'll be a consistent Prayer
with you as my disguise
a relentless lover
you're something descriptive
words couldn't describe you
and you're all that matters to me
I'll rather have you than silver or gold
I want your blessings and thoughts of me

Falala Falala falala
Mon jola jesu Falala Falala falala

l'll sell the ?auctions
only if you swerve the tides
and you are my greatest obsession
oh you're  constantly running through my mind
and you are all that matters to me
I'll rather have you than silver or gold
and though many times my head ? turns to guilt
but you still never let me go
Falala Falala falala
Mon jola jesu Falala Falala falala

Oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'll rather have you than silver or gold
I'll rather have you than riches and?
