Alright Tri-City, let's finish telling this story
(He rebuked the Red Sea and the waters dried up like a desert)
They dried up
(He rebuked the Red Sea and the waters dried up like a desert)
Alto
(He rebuked the Red Sea, the waters dried up like a desert)
(He rebuked the Red Sea, the waters, the waters, they dried up)
And the waters dried up just like a desert
(He rebuked the Red Sea, the waters dried up like a desert)
(He rebuked the Red Sea, the waters, the waters, they dried up)
Kristen
The horse and his rider
Drowned in the sea
If you just stand still
Stand still
God's power you will see
The horse and the rider
Drowned in the sea
Our God will deliver us
He will deliver
From the hands of the enemy
(He rebuked the Red Sea and the waters dried up like a desert)
Oh yeah
(He rebuked the Red Sea, the waters dried up like a desert)
Sing it
(He rebuked the Red Sea, the waters dried up like a desert)
Alto
Hey
(He rebuked the Red Sea, the waters, the waters, they dried up)
