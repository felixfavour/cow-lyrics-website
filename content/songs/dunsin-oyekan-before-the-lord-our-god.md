[Bridge]
The Earth is the Lord's,
And the Fullness thereof;
The World, and they
That Dwell therein.
For he hath Founded it
Upon the Seas,
And established it upon the Floods.
Who shall ascend
Into the Hill of the Lord
Or who shall Stand
In his holy Place?
He that hath Clean Hands,
And a pure Heart;
Who hath not Lifted up
His Soul unto Vanity,
Nor Sworn deceitfully
He shall receive the blessing
From the Lord,
And righteousness
From the God of his salvation.
This is the generation
Of them that seek him,
That seek thy face, O Jacob.
Lift up your heads,
O ye gates; and be ye lift up,
Ye everlasting doors;
And the King of glory
Shall come in.
Who is this King of Glory
The Lord Strong and Mighty,
The Lord Mighty in Battle.
Lift up your heads,
O ye gates; even lift them up,
Ye Everlasting doors;
And the King of Glory
Shall come in.
Who is this King of Glory
The Lord of hosts,
He is the King of Glory
