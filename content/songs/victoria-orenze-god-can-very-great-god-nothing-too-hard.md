God can make a way
Where there is no way
God can open door
Nobody can shut
God can sort out cases
We have given up on
{My God can make a way
Where there is no way
My God can Open door
That nobody can shut
My God can sort out cases
He Stretched the Sky on empty Space
Spoke to the Winds
And called the Rain
And yet the Cloud
Though must wind wage
You Blow my Mind
Lord you Love
Your Love is Endless
By your Works, your Wisdom Timeless
Great is your Mercy
Your Tender Mercy
You Blow my Mind
You Blow my Mind
{My God can make a way
Where there is no way
My God can Open door
That nobody can shut
My God can sort out cases
{God can make a way
Where there is no way
God can open door
Nobody can shut
God can sort out cases
