Lift up your gaze
Be lifted up
Tell everyone
How great the love
The love come down
From heaven's gate
To kiss the earth
With hope and grace
Sing
Who is this King of Glory?
The Lord, strong and mighty
Who is this King of Glory?
The Lord, strong and mighty
Lift up your hands
Be lifted up
Let the redeemed
Declare the love
We bow down
At heaven's gate
To kiss the feet
Of hope and grace
Sing
