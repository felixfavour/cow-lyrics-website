Our God has given us victory
In spite of how bad things may go
When you see tears running down my face
You need to know they're only tears of joy...
Chorus 1:
When you see my hands up
Don't mean I'm giving up
It only means I'm giving Him praise
When I throw my hands up
Don't mean I surrender!
I'm only giving Him praise!
Chorus 2:
You should think about what He's done for you
You should think about what He's gonna do
You can always find the reason to praise
If you take a deep breath and close your eyes
You should think about how He saved your life
You can always find the reason to praise
We have a breath, and that's weak and used;
But nothing can stand in my way
No matter what you are going through
Just remember, you're a victor, not a victim
Oh... yeah!
