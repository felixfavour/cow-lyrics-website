"Take It All Away"
(feat. Chandler Moore)
So take it all away
Take it all away
'Til all that's left is You
Take it all away, take it all
(Take it all away) Take it all
(Take it all away)
'Til all that's left is You
Take it all away
Take it all away right now, right now
(Take it all away)
'Til all that's left is You
Take it all away, oh yeah, oh yeah
Take it all away, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Take it all away)
'Til all that's left is You
Take it all away right now, right now
(Take it all away) Yeah
(Take it all away)
('Til all that's left is You) Take it all
(Take it all away) Oh
(Take it all away) Take it all
(Take it all away)
('Til all that's left is You)
'Til all that's left is Your love
You said 'til all that's left is You
Those who hunger and thirst
After righteousness
Your promise is we will be filled
'Til all that's left is You
You'll give us the desires of our heart
You'll give us what to want
You'll give us what to crave
'Til all that's left is You
Purify my heart
Create in me a clean heart
Create in me a clean heart
'Til all that's left is You
Renew the right spirit
Renew the right motives
Renew the right pursuit
Renew it, renew it
'Til all that's left is You
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, 'til all that's left is You
Take it all away
Take it all away
('Til all that's left is You)
(Take it all away)
('Til all that's left is You)
Holy fire burn
Holy fire burn
Empty everything inside of me
'Til all that's left is You
Burn it all away
Right now in Your presence
Oh, 'til all that's left is You
There's a cleansing happening now
Lift your hands
There's a cleansing happening now
The divine surgeon
He's in the room, oh
Even the things you don't know that are there
He's taking it out, but He's gentle
He's taking it out with His fire
He's taking it out with His love, His love, His love
He's a gentle surgeon
He won't hurt you, oh
He's taking it out, yeah
(Take whatever you desire)
