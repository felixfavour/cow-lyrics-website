Who else would rocks cry out to worship?
Whose glory taught the stars to shine?
Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
But this joy is mine
With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise
Lord Jesus, this song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
Who else would die for our redemption?
Whose resurrection means I'll rise? Hey
There isn't time enough to sing of all You've done
But I have eternity to try, yeah
With a thousand hallelujahs we magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory, the honor and the praise
Lord Jesus, this song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs and a thousand more
[Bridge]
Praise to the Lord, to the Lamb, to the King of Heaven
Praise, for He rose, now He reigns, we will sing forever
Praise to the Lord, to the Lamb, to the King of Heaven
Praise, for He rose, now He reigns, we will sing forever
Praise to the Lord, to the Lamb, to the King of heaven
Praise, for He rose and now He reigns, we will sing forever
