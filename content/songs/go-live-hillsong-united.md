[Chorus]
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go Your way
In the Father there is freedom
There is hope in the Name that is Jesus
Lay your life down give it all now
We are found in the love of the Saviour
[Pre-Chorus]
We've come alive in You
Set free to show the truth
Our lives will never be the same
We're giving it all away, away
We're giving it all to go your way
We are sold out to Your calling
Everything that we are for Your glory
Take our hearts now
Have it all now
Let our lives shine Your light like the morning
