Spoken:
All right boys and girls, let's join hands across the place
Can we do that? From the back to the front
Everybody, join hands with one, with one another
Across the aisles, all the way across the aisles
We're going to dance together, okay
So you're holding onto somebody, and that's your dancing partner tonight
Okay, that's your dancing partner
In a minute, we're going to do this together, okay
Hold on
We're going to do this together in just a minute
But we want to dance together in the river
The river Jesus
That everywhere it flows, it brings life to dead places, okay
That's what we're dancing for
So here we go, we'll try it
