Ignite my passion
Purify my heart
I surrender all to You
Overwhelm me
Overtake me
Have Your way
Let Your fire burn in me
Burn me up
Burn me up
Let Your fire burn in me
Burn me up
Burn me up
'Til I am consumed
Holy Spirit have Your way
Holy Spirit have Your way (Yeah)
Holy Spirit have Your way
Holy Spirit have Your way
(Holy Spirit have Your way)
That's our prayer tonight (Holy Spirit have Your way)
That's my heart's desire (Holy Spirit have Your way)
That's my prayer (Holy Spirit have Your way)
Have your way
(Let your fire burn in me)
(Burn me up) Burn me up
(Burn me up) Consuming fire of God
(Let your fire burn in me) Burn me up
(Burn me up) Burn me up
(Burn me up) That's my heart's desire
(Let your fire burn in me) Whatever is in me that's not like you
(Burn me up) I don't want it, I don't want it
(Burn me up) I don't want it, I don't want it
(Let your fire burn in me) That's my world God
(Burn me up) Yeah burn me up
(Burn me up)
'Til I am consumed
