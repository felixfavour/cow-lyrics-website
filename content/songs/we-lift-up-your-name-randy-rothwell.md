Salvation and glory belong to our God
And unto the Lamb on the Throne
Blessing and honor, wisdom and power
Be unto God alone
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hallelujah, glory to the Lamb
Hallelujah, to the great I am
We lift up Your name, O Lord
Worthy the Lamb who was slain
Taking all our pain
We lift up Your name, O Lord
Giving You honor and praise
With our hands up raised
To You, Lord
Salvation and glory belong to our God
And unto the Lamb on the Throne
Blessing and honor, wisdom and power
Be unto God alone
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hallelujah, all the nations sings
Hallelujah, to the King of kings
