Hear our earnest prayer O Lord
Hear our humble cry
Precious loving caring lord
On whom we rely
Ever loving, ever living God
Of whom no one can compare
All we ask is that you hear our prayer
Give us strength most Holy Lord
Strength to meet this day
Lead us by your Holy Word
Guide us in your way
For life is filled with winding turns
We have often lost our way
All we ask is that you lead today
Give us love that?s true O Lord
Trusting as a child
Love for all we see O Lord
Pure and undefiled
But to heal the heart and not turn away
Anyone who is in need
All we ask is teach us love indeed
Take me home with you my lord
When my life is through
Take me home with peace my lord
Let me rest with you
When I?ve fought the fight
And I?ve kept the faith
And my race on earth is won
All I ask is that you say well done
