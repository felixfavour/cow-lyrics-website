I'm calling on the God of Jacob
Whose love endures through generations
I know that You will keep Your covenant
I'm calling on the God of Moses
The One who opened up the ocean
I need You now to do the same thing for me
For me, for me
O God, my God, I need You
O God, my God, I need You now
How I need You now
O Rock, O Rock of Ages
I'm standing on Your faithfulness
On Your faithfulness
I'm calling on the God of Mary
Whose favor rests upon the lowly
I know with You all things are possible
I'm calling on the God of David
Who made a shepherd boy courageous
I may not face Goliath but I've got my own giants!
O God, my God, I need You
O God, my God, I need You now
How I need You now, yes
O Rock, O Rock of Ages
I'm standing on Your faithfulness
On Your faithfulness
O God, my God, I need You (I need You, Lord)
O God, my God, I need You now
How I need You now, yeah
O Rock, O Rock of Ages
I'm standing on Your faithfulness
On Your faithfulness
