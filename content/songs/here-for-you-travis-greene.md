Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?
Who shall stay in his holy place?
Only those who have clean hands and pure hearts
So give us clean hands and pure hearts
You are our desire
Lift it up now say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(x3)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
We're here for you
Let your spirit move
As we shout your praise
From our hearts to your ears
All the glory's yours
Now forever more
Hear our worship
All we can give it for you
