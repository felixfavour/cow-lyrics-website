Faithful, forever you are faithful
Father to the fatherless
You uphold the one who feels forsaken
You are faithful, god
Faithful, forever you are faithful
Lover of the wounded heart
You defend the poor and the forgotten
You are faithful, god
And i will sing to the maker of heaven and earth
God, you reign forever and your will endure
Faithful and true is the name of the lord
You are faithful, god
Faithful, forever you are faithful
Shelter for the fragile soul
You lift us up, you hold us all together
You are faithful, god
[Bridge]
You are there in every season of my soul
You are there, you're the anchor that will hold
You are there, in the valley of the shadows
You are faithful, god [x2]
