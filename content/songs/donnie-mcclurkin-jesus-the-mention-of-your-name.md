"Jesus, The Mention Of Your Name"
Jesus, Jesus
At the mention of Your name
Every knee will bow and tongue proclaim
Jesus, Jesus
You are Savior, You are Lord
And You are God
Everybody say
Jesus, Jesus
At the mention of Your name
Every knee will bow and tongue proclaim
Jesus, Jesus
You are Savior, You are Lord
And You are God
There is one name I love to hear
I love to sing its worth
It sounds like music in my ears
Sweetest name on the earth
Jesus, Jesus
At the mention of Your name
Every knee will bow and tongue proclaim
Jesus, Jesus
You are Savior, You are Lord
And You are God
You are God, so now
We worship and adore You
We lift our hands and praise
To the immortal, invisible
The Ancient of Days
Creation bows before You
As Your children give You praise
You're the only one
That's worthy of this song
Jesus, Jesus
At the mention of Your name
Every knee will bow, tongue proclaim
Jesus, Jesus
You are Savior, You are Lord
And You are God
You are Savior, You are Lord
And You are God
You are Savior, You are Lord
And You are God
Hallelujah, oh, thank You, Lord
I'm not ashamed to say
God, I'll tell the world
That You're the only living God, yeah
You're the only living God
Yes, You're the only living God
You're the only living God
It's not Buddha, not Krishna
Not Mohammad, not Allah, no, no
You are the only living God
But we'll stand here for the world to declare
You are the only living God
That there ain't no other God beside You anywhere
You are the only living God
And we love You, we love You
We love You, Lord, we love You, Jesus
We love You, Lord, for Your [?]
We love You with all of our hearts
We praise You, we praise You, Jesus
We lift You up and glorify You
We magnify Your holy name
You're worthy of the glory
We adore You, we adore You
We worship You as the Omega
You're the King of kings, the Lord of lords
The Mighty God, no one before You
Yeah, You're the only God
You're the only living God
You're the only living God
You're the only living God
You are Savior, You are Lord
And You are God
Jesus
