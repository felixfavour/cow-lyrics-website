it's gonna take forever
to exhaust my gratitude
but with God I stand
till the whole world knows
that am grateful for giving your only son
you took the pain and now am the one
whose grateful (am grateful , so grateful )
you gave your life
what more could you give
you suffered and died
so that I could leave
I give you thanks for all you have done
you are my father and I am your son
and dead couldn't hold you back, am grateful (am grateful)
the grave couldn't hold you back, am grateful ( oh yeah)
am grateful,  so grateful
am grateful, am grateful, am grateful
