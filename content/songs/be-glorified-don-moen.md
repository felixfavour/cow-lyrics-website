With every beat of my heart
Every song that I sing
Every prayer that I pray
Every offering I bring
In every thought that I have
Every word that I say
Oh, be glorified (yeah, yeah)
From the start of each day
'Til the end of the night
Let me bring praise
Let me bring light
Lord, I offer my life
As a sacrifice
Be glorified (yeah, yeah)
Chorus:
This is my prayer
It's the cry of my heart
Lord, I want my life
To reflect who You are
Oh Lord, please stir up the fire
And burn everything
'Til all I desire is You
With every breath that I take
In everything that I do
Let me lift up Your name
And bring honor to You
Let the words of my mouth
Only speak truth
Oh, be glorified (yeah, yeah)
