When you're dull from all that glitters,
When your thoughts have a hollow ring,
When you can't escape
From the feeling
You're getting it wrong
All your foolproof plans seem foolish,
All your status is status quo,
All your really need to know is where you belong.
Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
Look full in his wonderful face.
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of his glory and grace.
I was used to the cold for so long
That couldn't feel anything.
And I shivered and stared
Like a beggar who won't lift his hands.
I was numb until he touched me.
I was deaf until he heard.
I was senseless 'til I met
The one who understands.
Turn your eyes upon Jesus.
Look full in his wonderful face.
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of his glory and grace.
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of his glory and grace.
