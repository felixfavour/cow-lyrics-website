"Mended"
How many times can one heart break?
It was never supposed to be this way
Look in the mirror, but you find someone you never thought you'd be
Oh, but I can still recognize
The one I love in your tear stained eyes
I know you might not see him now, so lift your eyes to me
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
When you see too far gone
I see one step away from home
You see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet
When you see wounded, I see mended
You see your worst mistake
But I see the price I paid
And there's nothing you could ever do to lose what grace has won
So hold on, it's not the end
No, this is where love's work begins
I'm making all things new
And I will make a miracle of you
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
When you see too far gone
I see one step away from home
You see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet
When you see wounded, I see mended
I see my child, my beloved
The new creation you're becoming
You see the scars from when you fell
But I see the stories they will tell
You see worthless, I see priceless
You see pain, but I see a purpose
You see unworthy, undeserving
But I see you through eyes of mercy
When you see broken beyond repair
I see healing beyond belief
You're not too far gone
You're one step away from home
When you see nothing but damaged goods
I see something good in the making
I'm not finished yet, no
When you see wounded, I see mended
I see mended
I see mended
I'm not finished yet
When you see wounded, I see mended
