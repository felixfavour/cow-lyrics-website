Worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy is the Lamb,
on High
Worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy is the Lamb,
Worthy is the Lamb,
on High
Thou art worthy to take the book
To open the seals thereof
For Thou was slain and has redeemed us
To God by thy blood
By thy blood, by thy blood
By thy blood, by thy blood
By thy blood, by thy blood
By thy blood, by thy blood
Thou art worthy to take the book
To open the seals thereof
For Thou was slain and has redeemed us
To God by Thy blood
By thy blood,
every kindred and tongue
By thy blood,
all people in every nation
By thy blood,
we're kings and priests
We shall reign, by Thy blood
By thy blood,
heaven and earth are saying
By thy blood,
blessing and honor and glory
By thy blood,
and power beyond to Him
Upon the throne
By thy blood,
By thy blood (for it's only)
By thy blood,
every kindred and tongue
By Thy blood,
all people in every nation
By Thy blood,
we're kings and priests
We shall reign,
by thy blood
By thy blood
By thy blood,
heaven and earth are saying
By thy blood,
blessing and honor and glory
By thy blood,
and power beyond to Him
By thy blood
By thy blood
