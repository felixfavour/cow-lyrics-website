Who taught the sun?
Where to stand in the morning
And who taught the ocean
You can only come this far

And who showed the moon
Where to hide till evening
Whose words alone can
Catch a falling star

Well I know my Redeemer lives
I know my redeemer lives
All of creation testifies
This life within me cries
I know my redeemer lives
Yeah

The very same God
That spins things in orbit
Runs to the weary
The worn and the weak

And the same gentle hands
That hold me when I'm broken
They conquer death to bring me victory

Now I know my redeemer lives
I know my redeemer lives
Let all creation testify
Let this life within me cry
I know my redeemer

He lives to take away my shame
And he lives forever I'll proclaim
That the payment for my sin
Was the precious life He gave
But now he's alive and there's an empty grave

And I know my redeemer, he lives
I know my redeemer lives
Let all creation testify
Let this life within me cry
I know my redeemer
