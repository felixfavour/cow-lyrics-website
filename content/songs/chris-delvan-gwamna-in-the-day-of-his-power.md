The Lord will send the rod of your 
Strength out of Zion
Rule thou in the midst of your enemies
Because you love righteousness and hate evil
The Lord has anointed you with the oil of gladness
The Lord He said to my Lord sit at my right hand till I make your enemies your footstool for the kingdom belongs to Jesus Christ
He's the governor amongst the nation
Hear me when I say
In the day of His power
The people will be willing
Hello o holy Zion
Great things are spoken concerning you
You are beautiful for every situation
You are Zion the city of the living God The Lord has loved the gates of Zion
More than all the dwellings of Jacob
He will establish you with power and glory
The zeal of the Lord shall perform this
And His every word
Hear me when I say
It's not by power nor by might
But by My Spirit says the Lord
The race is not to the swiftest
Neither is the battle to the very strong
Unto him that overcometh
Surely shall receive a crown of life
For by his strength by his strength 
Shall no man prevail
The Lord Himself is the builder of the city
Holy and mighty
Holy and mighty
It is by Your grace o Lord
It is by Your mercy Lord
It is by Your faith o Lord
It is to Your glory Lord
It is by Your grace that I live 
It is by Your grace that I live 
It is by Your grace that I live 
It is to Your grace that I live
