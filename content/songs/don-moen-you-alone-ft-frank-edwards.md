Lord God of Israel
There is no God in heaven above
Or on earth below like You
You keep Your covenant and mercy
With Your servants who walks before You with all their hearts
You alone are God
You alone are God
You alone are God
You alone are God
We lift our voice in praise (My voice in praise)
Eh You alone are God (You alone are God)
We're bound to worship You (We worship You)
Eh You alone are God
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
(We worship You) Eh eh eh
(Oh oh) You alone are God
Oh oh oh (Oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh (Oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh (You alone)
You alone are God (Yes You are)
You alone are God
(You alone) You alone are God
(Yes You are) You alone are God
(Oh oh eh eh) You alone are God
You alone are God
You alone are God
I'm bound to worship You
You alone are God
You're worthy Oh Lord
To receive glory and honour and power
For You created all things
By Your will they exist and were created
Yours oh Lord is for greatness the power and the glory the victory and the majesty
For all that is in heaven and in the earth is Yours
Yours is the kingdom oh Lord
And You're exalted as the head over all
You alone are God
And we worship You
You alone are God
You alone are God
You alone are God (Yes You are)
You alone are God
