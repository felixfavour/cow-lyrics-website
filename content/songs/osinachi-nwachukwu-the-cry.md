That Cry you will Cry
When the Saints have gone
Cry it now, when the Saints
Are still around
That shout you will shout
When you hear the Saints have gone
Shout it now, when the Saints
Are still around
After Rapture
There will be no more Mercy
This is the time to ask
For God's Mercy
When the Saints are still around
Mercy will not be Available
When the Saints have gone
Grace will not be Available
When the Saints have gone
Mercy and Grace will not be Available
When the Saints have gone
Repentance is now
When the Saints are still around
Repentance is now
When the Saints are still in the World
This is the time to Serve him
In Truth and in Spirit
Be conscious of Eternity
Don't live your life anyhow
Heaven is real, hell is real
Come to Jesus Today
Seek him when he can be Found
Tomorrow might be too late ooh
He's knocking at the door of your Heart
Let him in, he's waiting for you
Remember, he will not wait forever
He's Available now ooh
Let him in, he's waiting for you

[PART 2]

There is a Beautiful Home far away
Where the Saints are Living
It's Shinning like a Light
Hear the sweet Melody
They are Singing unto Jesus
They are giving him Praises Forevermore
There is a Beautiful Home far away
Where there is no death
Where there is no sorrow
Where there is no crying
Where there is no tears
The Saints are Singing
Unto his Holy name
They are giving him Glory Forevermore

Ala ndi Mara mma
