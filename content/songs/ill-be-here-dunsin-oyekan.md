I'll be here worshiping
All of the days of my life
I'll be here worshiping
All of the days of my life
Everybody say
I'll be here worshiping
All of the days of my life
I'll be here worshiping (Praise waits for You oh God, in Zion)
All of the days of my life
Say I'll be here
I'll be here worshiping
All of the days of my life (say "I'll be here")
I'll be here worshiping
All of the days of my life (let's sing loud for them)
Say "I'll be here"I'll be here, lifting hands (even when it is not easy)
Even when it isn't easy
I'll be here, lifting hands
Even when it isn't easy (say "I'll be here")
I'll be here, lifting hands
Even when it isn't easy
I'll be here, lifting hands
Even when it isn't easy (say "I'll be here")
I'll be here, lifting hands (somebody lift your hands)
Even when it isn't easy
I'll be here, lifting hands
Even when it isn't easy (say "I'll be here")
I'll be here, bowing down (all of my days)
All of the days of my life
I'll be here, bowing down
All of the days of my life (say "I'll be here")
I'll be here, bowing down
All of the days of my life
I'll be here, bowing down
All of the days of my life
Somebody bow before the throne
I'll be here
Lift your vioce and say, "I'll be here"I'll be here, bowing down
All of the days of my life
I'll be here, bowing down
All of the days of my life (say "I'll make a vow before You")
I'll be here, bowing down
All of the days of my life
I'll be here, bowing down
All of the days of my life
I'll be here worshiping
All of the days of my life (praise waits for You oh God, in Zion)
I'll be here worshiping (I'll praise, worship, offerings of praise before You Jesus)
All of the days of my life (one more time)
Say "I'll be here"I'll be here worshiping (worshiping all of the days)
All of the days of my life
I'll be here worshiping
All of the days of my life
I'll be here
Dropping my sacrifice
All of the days of my life
I'll be here, worshiping
All of the days of my life
I'll be here worshiping
All of the days of my life
I'll be here worshiping
All of the days of my life
As the musician begin to play this line
Ask the Lord for something, ask Him for something
No one comes here and goes back the same way
It's not possible
I'll be here
Because you've worshiped tonight
I'll be here, worshiping
All of the days of my life
