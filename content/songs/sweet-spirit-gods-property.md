No more tears
And no more fears
Ever since I met the Holy One
Yes He is so sweet
And He comforts me
I'm gonna take Him wherever I go
There's a sweet, sweet spirit
In this place
And I'm going to take that spirit
With me every day
There's a sweet, sweet spirit
In this place
And I'm going to take that spirit
With me every day
There's been a change
A change in me
I've got a new attitude
A whole different personality
And it's you, Spirit
And I want the world to know
I'm not at all acting funny
Because of You I have a spiritual glow
