[Instrumental]
The One who made the blind to see
Is moving here in front of me
Moving here in front of me
The One who made the deaf to hear
Is silencing my every fear
Silencing my every fear
I believe in You, I believe in You
You're the God of miracles
I believe in You, I believe in You
You're the God of miracles
The One who does impossible
Is reaching out to make me whole
Reaching out to make me whole
The One who put death in its place
His life is flowing through my veins
His life is flowing through my veins
I believe in You, I believe in You
You're the God of miracles
I believe in You, I believe in You
You're the God of miracles
I believe in You, I believe in You
You're the God of miracles
I believe in You, I believe in You
You're the God of miracles
