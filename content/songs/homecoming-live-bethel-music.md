Lord, I confess
That I've been a criminal
I've stolen Your breath
And sang my own song
And Lord, I confess
That I'm far from innocent
These shackles I wear
Oh, I bought on my own
[Chorus: Cory Asbury]
These scarlet sins had a crimson cost
You nailed my debt to that old rugged cross
An empty slate, at the empty grave
Thank God that stone was rolled away
Lord, I confess
I've been a prodigal
Made for Your house
But I walked my own roads
Then Jesus came
He tore down my prison walls
Death came to life
When He called me by name
