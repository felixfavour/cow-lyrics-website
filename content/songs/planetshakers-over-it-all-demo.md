The world may fade away
But You are here to stay
You are the great I am
The beginning and the end
The calm of every storm
The light of every dawn
You always make a way
And forever You will reign
You're over it all
You're over it all
You're over it all
Jesus, You are Lord
You're over it all
You're over it all
You're over it all
Jesus, You are Lord
You're over it all
The highest authority
Your word brings clarity
Your power rushes in
You're moving once again
You're breaking every chain
You're taking all the pain
There's nothing You can't do
There's no one else like You
You're over it all
You're over it all
You're over it all
Jesus, You are Lord
You're over it all
You're over it all
You're over it all
Jesus, You are Lord
You are my defender
My savior for all time
You are my redeemer
Forever on my side
You are my provider
My healer for all time
You remain the same
This will never change
You're over it all (You're over it all)
You're over it all (You're over it all)
You're over it all
Jesus, You are Lord
You're over it all
You're over it all
You're over it all
Jesus, You are Lord
You are my defender
My savior for all time
You are my redeemer
Forever on my side
You are my provider
My healer for all time
You remain the same (yes, You will)
This will never change (You are my...)
You are my defender
My savior for all time
You are my redeemer
Forever on my side
You are my provider
My healer for all time
You remain the same
This will never change
You remain the same
This will never change
Over it all
