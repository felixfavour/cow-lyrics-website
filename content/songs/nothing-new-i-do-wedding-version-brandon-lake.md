It feels like all the songs have probably all been sung
But I wanna bring you something true
Something that moves you
I don't have all the words
To tell you how much you're worth
But I wanna bring you something true
Something that moves you
From the dawn to the dusk of my days
From the depths of my soul and with all of my strength
Here is my heart in just one phrase
I love you, I love you, I love you
When I say it, I mean it, it's true
And I hope you can see it in all that I do
I know it might be nothing new
I love you, I love you, I love you, I do
I'm sure the angels sing beautiful melodies
But I wanna bring a song that's mine
For the rest of my life
Oh, I wanna bring a song that's mine
For the rest of my life
