I'm standing at your door
My heart is calling yours
Come fall into my arms
You're weary from it all
Been running for too long
I'm here to bring you home
I'm reaching out, I'll chase you down
I dare you to believe how much I love you now
Don't be afraid, I am your strength
We'll be walking on the water, dancing on the waves
Look up and lift your eyes
The future's open wide
I have great plans for you, oh, yes, I do
Your past is dead and gone
Your healing has begun
I'm making all things new, watch me do it
I'm reaching out, yes, I am, I'll chase you down
I dare you to believe how much I love you now, ohh
Don't be afraid, I am your strength
We'll be walking on the water, dancing on the waves
