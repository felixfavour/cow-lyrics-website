Pierce Through me
Cut through me, Open me Up
Do your Surgical Work in me
Till I See like you See
Pierce Through me
Cut through me, Open me Up
Do your Surgical Work in me
Till I See like you See

Take away every Spiritual Glaucoma
I need to See
Don't want to See Men like Trees
I need to See
We don't want to See Men like Trees
We need to See, we need to See

Pierce Through me
Cut through me, Open me Up
Do your Surgical Work in me
Till I See like you See
Pierce Through me
Cut through me, Open me Up
Do your Surgical Work in me
Till I See like you See
{ Pierce Through me
Cut through me, Open me Up
Do your Surgical Work in me
Till I See like you See } [Repeat]
[Bridge]
We need to See like you See
We need to Hear
Like you Hear
We need to Feel
Like you Feel
We need to Know like you Know
I need to See
Like you See
I need to Hear like you Hear
I need to Feel
Like you Feel
I need to Know like you Know
{ We need to See
Like you See
We need to Hear like you Hear
We need to Feel
Like you Feel
We need to Know
Like you Know } [Repeat]
[Outro]
I need to See like you See
We need to Hear like you Hear
We need to Behold
Like you Behold
We need to Look like you Lord
We need to Look like you
To See like you See
We need to Think like you Think
We need to Hear like you Hear
