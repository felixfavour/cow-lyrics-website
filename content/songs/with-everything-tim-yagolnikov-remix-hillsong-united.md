So let hope rise
And darkness tremble
In Your holy light
Every eye will see
Jesus, our God
Great and mighty to be praised
God of all days
Glorious in all of Your ways
Your majesty, the wonder and grace
In the light of Your name
With everything
With everything
We will shout for your glory
With everything
With everything
We will shout forth your praise
Our hearts will cry
Be glorified
Be lifted high
Above all names
