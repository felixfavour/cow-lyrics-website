We confess, You're limitless
Our greatest dreams could never hold
The measure of Your power
We cry out, we need You now
God of restoration bring
A miracle this hour
You make the sun stand still
The oceans part, You're powerful
It's who You are
God most high, stir a fire in us
With Your power inside
We won't waste our lives
God most high, strong and mighty in us
Be our passion, our prize
We won't waste our lives
Our lives ablaze, our hearts won't faint
For You, our God, will be our strength
We're living for Your name
You make the sun stand still
The oceans part, You're powerful
It's who You are
God most high, stir a fire in us
With Your power inside
We won't waste our lives
God most high, strong and mighty in us
Be our passion, our prize
We won't waste our lives
All things are possible
With our God, our God
Nothing is too great for
Our God
Our God
All things are possible
With our God, our God
Nothing is too great for
Our God
God most high, stir a fire in us
With Your power inside
We won't waste our lives
God most high, strong and mighty in us
Be our passion, our prize
We won't waste our lives
All things are possible
With our God, our God
Nothing is too great for
Our God
Our God
All things are possible
With our God, our God
