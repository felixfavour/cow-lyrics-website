My life is a life for Your cause
My will laid aside for Your call
And reserved all the depths of my heart
Only for You
I'm caught in the rhythms of grace
They overcome all of my ways
We align in each step that we take
To live for Your glory
And there's none beside You, God
And there's none beside You, God
You're there in dark of the night
While holding the sun and its light
Through the triumph and trials alike
There's no one beside You
Your voice calls the stars by their name
You whisper them all to their place
To testify of Your wonder and praise
Both now and forever
