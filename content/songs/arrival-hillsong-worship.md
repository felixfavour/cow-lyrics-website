Who is God that He would take our frame
The artisan inside the paint
Or breathe the very air His breath sustains
The architect inside the plan
Oh, come now, hail His arrival, the God of creation
Royalty robed in the flesh He created
Jesus, the maker has made Himself known
All hail the infinite infant God
The One who had no start and knows no end
Became confined in time and tense
The Everlasting God, the Great I Am
In the mercy of a mother's hands
Oh, come now, hail His arrival, the God of creation
Royalty robed in the flesh He created
Jesus, the maker has made Himself known
All hail the infinite infant God
