I hear the sound the abundance of rain
That means my blessings are on the way
May not see it but I (really do) believe it
The promises of God are already mine
[Repeat: x2]
Already mine
Already mine
I believe its already mine
I hear the sound the abundance of rain
That means my blessings are on the way
May not see it but i (really do) believe it
The promises of God are already mine
[Repeat: x4]
Already mine
I believe its already mine
If God said it
I believe it
Until I receive it
[Repeat: x4]
I'll hold onto his every word
The promises of God are already mine
