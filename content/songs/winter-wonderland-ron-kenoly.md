Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrilling
In spite of the chill in the weather
Love knows no season, love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time
Here in the open
We're walking and hoping together
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is parson brown
He'll say "are you married?"We'll say "No man!
But you can do the job when you're in town"Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
