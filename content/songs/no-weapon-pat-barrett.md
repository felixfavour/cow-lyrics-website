When darkness closes in on every side
When battles rage and when the waters rise
I fear no evil for I know the truth
Nothing can separate my heart from You
'Cause there's no weapon stronger than Your love
There's no weapon stronger than Your love
No height, no depth can overcome
'Cause there's no weapon stronger than Your love
You say that faith can make the mountain move
And nothing is impossible for You
I fear no evil for I know the truth
Nothing can separate my heart from You
'Cause there's no weapon stronger than Your love
There's no weapon stronger than Your love
No height, no depth can overcome
'Cause there's no weapon stronger than Your love
[Bridge]
A mighty fortress, a shield around me
The power of Heaven in Your mighty hand
You go before me, You won my victory
And in this promise, I forever stand
Oh, in Your promise
You will never leave us
Oh, You won't forsake us
Oh, You are always with us
