The oceans and the mountains
The cattle on the thousand hills are yours,
For your grace to fight my battles
For the holy ghost that dwells inside of me
I will bow my heart to the living word
I will lift my hands and voice to sing

Yabo Yabo 
[Praise, praise]
Kai kadai ka isa yabo
[only you deserve my praise]

Yabo Yabo 
[Praise, praise]
Kai kadai ka isa yabo
[only you deserve my praise]

For the air that I'm breathing
Every struggle that you brought me through
For my friends and my family
For your word that is ever true to me
I'm here to bow my heart
To the living word 
I'm here to lift my hands and voice to say

Yabo Yabo 
[Praise, praise]
Kai kadai ka isa yabo
[only you deserve my praise]

Yabo Yabo 
[Praise, praise]
Kai kadai ka isa yabo
[only you deserve my praise]

Yesu kai ne dutsen ceto na
[Jesus, you are my rock of salvation]
Yes kai ne Allan alloli 
[Jesus, you the God of all gods]

Yabo Yabo 
[Praise, praise]
Kai kadai ka isa yabo
[only you deserve my praise]

Yabo Yabo 
[Praise, praise]
Kai kadai ka isa yabo
[only you deserve my praise]
