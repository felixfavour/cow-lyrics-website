God, You were there from my beginning
For I was crafted by Your hands
You see my hopes and hesitations
My days are written in Your plan
If You have seen my weakest moments
And still You love me even then
I need no greater confirmation
That God, Your goodness has no end
I come to Jesus, lay down my weakness
No need for hiding, here in His light
This truth I treasure, my peace forever
Is being known and loved by Him
I trust with Jesus, it is finished
For He has paid my every debt
No need to pull it all together
For what is broken He will mend
I come to Jesus, lay down my weakness
No need for hiding, here in His light
This truth I treasure, my peace forever
Is being known and loved by Him
Though I can't see the path before me
I know the One who knows the way
And as I walk, His hand will guide me
Until I see Him face to face
I come to Jesus, lay down my weakness
No need for hiding, here in His light
This truth I treasure, my peace forever
Is being known and loved by Him
Is being known and loved by Him
