Who is like the Lord? Nobody
Who is like the Lord? No, no, no, no, no, nobody
Who is like the Lord? Nobody
Who is like the Lord? No, no, no, no, no, nobody
If our God is for us, who can be against us?
He will keep His promise
There's nobody like Him
What can separate us from the love of Jesus?
He will keep His promise
There's nobody like Him, nobody like Him, oh
Who is like the Lord? Nobody
Who is like the Lord? No, no, no, no, no, nobody
Who is like the Lord? Nobody
Who is like the Lord? No, no, no, no, no, nobody
If our God is for us, who can be against us?
He will keep His promise
There's nobody like Him
What can separate us from the love of Jesus?
He will keep His promise
There's nobody like Him, nobody like Him, oh
There is none in heaven or earth like You
There is none in heaven or earth like You
There is none in heaven or earth like You
There is none in heaven or earth like You
