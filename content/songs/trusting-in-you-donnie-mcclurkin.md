I'm trusting in you Lord God
Trusting in you
Trusting in you Lord God
Trusting in you
When I was in trouble lord, you brought me through
So I'm trusting in you Lord God
Trusting in you
Oh yes I am, oh my, put your hands together, everybody join and say
I'm trusting in you Lord
Trusting in you
Trusting in you Lord God
Trusting in you
When I was in trouble, you brought me through
Trusting in you Lord
Trusting in you
Come on everybody, put your hands together
Say oh (oh) hey (hey) oh (oh)
Say no more doubt (no more doubt)
And no more fears (no more fears)
No painful memories (no painful memories)
And useless tears no (useless tears)
Na na na no more guilt (no more guilt)
From my past hey(from my past)
It can't last any longer (it can't last)
Gone at last (gone at last)
