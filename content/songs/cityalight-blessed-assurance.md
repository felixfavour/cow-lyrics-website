All my attempts to be satisfied
Were vain and empty
Until the moment You rescued me
And Your love filled me
My soul sings
Now my soul sings
What blessed assurance
I've found in You
I've found in You
I won't be shaken I will not be moved
How steadfast Your strong hand
Is keeping me
Is keeping me
I won't be shaken I will not be moved
Oh blessed assurance
No other love that I've ever known
Compares to You God
No other love that I've ever found
Has done what You've done
My soul sings
Now my soul sings
What blessed assurance
I've found in You
I've found in You
I won't be shaken I will not be moved
How steadfast Your strong hand
Is keeping me
Is keeping me
I won't be shaken I will not be moved
Oh blessed assurance
Ever my anchor
Ever my strength
Ever my portion
And all I need
Ever my healing
Ever my hope
Ever the truth that leads me home
That leads me home
What blessed assurance
I've found in You
I've found in You
I won't be shaken I will not be moved
How steadfast Your strong hand
Is keeping me
Is keeping me
I won't be shaken I will not be moved
What blessed assurance
I've found in You
I've found in You
I won't be shaken I will not be moved
How steadfast Your strong hand
Is keeping me
Is keeping me
I won't be shaken I will not be moved
Oh blessed assurance
