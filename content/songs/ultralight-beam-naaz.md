[Chorus]
I'm tryna keep my faith
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God's dream
This is a God's dream
This is everything
This is everything
Deliver us serenity
Deliver us peace
Deliver us loving
You know we need it
You know we need it
You know we need it
You know I need it
That's why we need you now, oh
Pray for Paris
Pray for the parents
This is a God's dream
This is a God's dream
This is a God's dream
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God's dream
This is a God's dream
This is everything
This is everything
