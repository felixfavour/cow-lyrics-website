The whole world belongs to you, governments and galaxies
You are Holy, holy God
The nations belongs to you
You are God of everything
You are Holy, Holy God
You're the God of miracles
Who was and is to come
All power belongs to you Almighty God
You're the one who says a thing
And it surely comes to pass Almighty God
We bow before your throne Almighty God
You are Holy,
Righteous and Worthy
You are Worthy to be praised
