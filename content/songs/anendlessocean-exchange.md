Necessarily
It's you or nothing
I can't think it twice
Sofri Sofri
You love me jeeli(gently)
I'm in this for life
Oh as I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear none
It's your body for my body
It's your spirit for mine yea you all.
I wan dey scream, I kon dey shout like I'm losing my mind
I want it
Oh I want it all for me
(I want it, oh I want it all)
You're the only, you are the only one for me
(I want it, oh I want it all)
How do you like me?
Say it!
How do you want me?
Tell it!
It's critical, I need your confirmation
All of the lines I'm writing
All of these thoughts I'm spilling
I need you bad
I need you! is not for options
You're my only option
Oh as I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear none
It's your body for my body
It's your spirit for mine yea you all.
I wan dey scream, I kon dey shout like I'm losing my mind
I want it
Oh I want it all for me
(I want it, oh I want it all)
You're the only, you are the only one for me
(I want it, oh I want it all)
I wan dey scream, I kon dey shout like I'm losing my mind
I want it
Oh I want it all for me
(I want it, oh I want it all)
You're the only, you are the only one for me
(I want it, oh I want it all)
