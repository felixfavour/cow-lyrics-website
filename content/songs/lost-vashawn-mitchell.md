I will seek You, until I find You
For the rest of my life
I'll keep running after You
I will seek You, until I find You
For the rest of my life
I'll keep running after You
Chorus:
I'm lost without You
I've finally found my place in You
Drifted away, I'm here to stay
Safe in Your grace
There's no turning back now
Closer than I've ever been before
There's tranquility, blessed security
Safe in Your arms
So glad I've found You
(Chorus 2x)
The search is over now
I'm right where I belong
I've found You, I've found You, I've found You...
(6x)
