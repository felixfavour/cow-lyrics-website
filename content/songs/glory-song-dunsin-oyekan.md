[Intro]
(Father, we have come to touch your glory)
(All over this room)
(Release your glory like never before)
(Let it rest on men right now)
(Speaking in tongues)
(My God)
(Speaking in tongues)
(My God)
(The glory of the Lord is here)
(I feel it in my bones)
(It’s like fire in my bones)
(It’s like fire in my bones)
(It’s like electricity in my bones)
(Father, let your glory, let your glory cover this room now)
(Speaking in tongues)
(Ushers movе around)
(There’s a surge of powеr coming)
(Speaking in tongues)
(My God)
(Speaking in tongues)
(From the crown of your head to the soles of your feet)
(I said from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet)
(I release the glory of God, the glory of God)
(The Kabod of God)
(Help them, help them)
(The weight of God)
