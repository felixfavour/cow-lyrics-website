So we get out the way today
We move ourselves out of the way
I'm getting out of the way
I'm moving out of the way
To let Your glory fall
We don't wanna drive Your glory
We don't wanna control the glory
We are carriers of glory
So You do what You wanna do
And when You move that's when we'll move
When You move that's when we'll move
So let Your glory fall
