Great is thy faithfulness
Oh God my Father
There is no shadow of turning with thee
Thou changest not thy compassions they fail not
As thou has been, thou forever will be
Summer and winter
Spring time and harvest
Sun moon and stars in there courses above
Join with all nature in manifold witness
To thy great faithfulness mercy and love
Great is thy faithfulness
Great is thy faithfulness
Morning by morning
New mercies I see
All of I have needed, thy hand hath provided
Great is thy faithfulness
Lord unto me
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth
Thine own dear presence, to cheer and to guide
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside
Great is thy faithfulness
Great is thy faithfulness
Morning by morning
New mercies I see
All I have needed, thy hand hath provided
Great is thy faithfulness
Lord unto me
Great is thy faithfulness
Great is thy faithfulness
Morning by morning
New mercies I see
All I have needed, thy hand hath provided
Great is thy faithfulness
Great is thy faithfulness
Great is thy faithfulness
Lord unto me
