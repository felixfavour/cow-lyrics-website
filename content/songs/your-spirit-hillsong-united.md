I lay down my life at Your feet
Humble myself under Your mighty hand
For I have sinned and fallen short before
But I know Your grace abounds
Pour out Your Spirit on us
Pour out Your Spirit on us
Upon us now
Spirit come and fill this place
Sweet presence Jesus Your embrace
Thank You Lord You're worthy to be praised
Above all things I seek Your face
Pour out Your Spirit on us
Pour out Your Spirit on us
Pour out Your Spirit on us
Pour out Your Spirit on us
Upon us now
[Interlude]
Thank You Lord You're worthy to be praised
Above all things I seek Your face
