A joyful sound of praise to You
A thankful heart for all You do
For all my days I'll dwell in Your house, oh Lord, I know
I am safe here with You
I run, I run
I run to Your goodness
I dance, I dance
I dance in Your presence
I lift, my hands, for all that You've done for me
Fear may come but I am sure
In the Fathers arms, I am secure
The battles raging inside my heart are won, I know
I am safe here with You
I run, I run
I run to Your goodness
I dance, I dance
I dance in Your presence
I lift, my hands, for all that You've done for me
And I run, I run
I run to Your goodness
I dance, I dance
I dance in Your presence
I lift, my hands, for all that You've done for me
