My life is a light for Your cause
My will laid aside for Your call
And reserved are the depths of my heart
Only for You
I'm caught in the rhythms of grace
They overcome all of my ways
Realigning each step everyday
To live for Your glory
There's none beside You God
There's none beside You God
You're there in the dark of the night
While holding the sun and its light
Through the triumph and trials alike
There's no one beside You
Your voice called the stars by their name
You whispered them all to their place
To testify of Your wonder and praise
Both now and forever
There's none beside You God
There's none beside You God
I live my life to shine Your light
There is none beside You God
