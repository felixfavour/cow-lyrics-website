I've been strong and I've been broken within a moment
I've been faithful and I've been reckless at every bend
I've held everything together and watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled in the same breath
I have wrestled and I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift and drifted home again
Plundered blessing 'til I've been despеrate to find redemption
And еvery time I turn around, Lord, You're still there
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was found (Come on sing) before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
Grace to spare for all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me
And I know I, I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow this kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow You love me as You find me (Come on)
Who am I to think Your glory needs my praises?
But if this borrowed breath is Yours, Lord, take it all (Come on)
You are faithful and You are gracious and I'm just grateful
To think You don't need a single thing and still You want my heart (Oh, oh)
