All on the altar
Surrendered again
Freely, I lay down
My everything
'Cause this is my honor
The gift that I bring
I will be a living sacrifice
All my heart and soul to glorify
I offer nothing less than all my life
For Jesus Christ
I just wanna bless You
Whatever it takes
With my mind and my body
My spirit and strength (Yeah)
If You are a fire
Then set me ablaze
And I will be a living sacrifice
All my heart and soul to glorify
I offer nothing less than all my life
For Jesus Christ, woah
We give it all, we give it all
I'll give You all, give You all of my worship
Fall, fire, fall, fire, fall, comе consume it
I'll give You all, give You all of my worship
Fall, firе, fall, fire, fall, come consume it
I'll give You all, give You all of my, come on, tell me now
Fall, fire, fall, come consume it, God
I'll give You all, give You all of my worship
Fall, fire, fall, fire, fall
