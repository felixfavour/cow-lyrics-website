No one appointed You
They can't vote You out or in
No one can take Your place
For You have always been
You are the most high judge
Your laws are just and true
Your Word will never change
You can't be overruled
God of creation
High priest and King
Ruler of the nations
Lord of everything
In righteousness You reign
All things belong to You
You're worthy of our praise
Soon every knee shall bow
And every tongue proclaim
God of creation
High priest and King
Ruler of the nations
Lord of everything
In righteousness You reign
