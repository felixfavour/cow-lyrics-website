Even my darkness is light to You
Even my darkness is light to You
It's hard to believe it but You say that it's true
Even my darkness is light to You
Even my darkness is light to You
Even my darkness is light to You
It's hard to believe it but You say that it's true
Even my darkness is light to You
My darkness is light to You
My darkness is light to You
Even my darkness is light to You
Even my darkness is light to You
From the deepest of depths to the stars up above
There is no way I could escape His steadfast love
It's hard to believe it but You say that it's true
Even my darkness is light to You
My darkness is light to You
Even my darkness is light to You
