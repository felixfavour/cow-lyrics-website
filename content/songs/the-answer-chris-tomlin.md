I used to wonder
If I would ever
Find what I was searching for
Getting lost and
Forever chasin'
Always wantin' something more
[Pre-Chorus]
The questions I was fightin'
But You were never hidin'
Just needed some remindin'
Who is gonna love me all my life
Who is gonna never leave my side
Who is gonna be the heartbeat of everything I do
The answer is always You
Always You
It's been a wild ride
And for a while, I've
Had my share of highs and lows, no doubt
But You're the calm when
The storm is ragin'
Oh, God, you never let me go, oh no
