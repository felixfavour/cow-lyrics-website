[Intro: Chris Tomlin]
Let's stand together, can we sing this?
Do you feel the world is broken? (We do)
Do you feel the shadows deepen? (We do)
But do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting through? (We do)
Do you wish that you could see it all made new? (We do)
And is all creation groaning? (It is)
Is a new creation coming? (It is)
Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst? (It is)
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this? (It is)
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin]
Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the gravе
He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom thе slave
[Refrain 1: Chris Tomlin]
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory
Is He worthy of this?
He is
