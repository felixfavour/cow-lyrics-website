The blind have sight
The deaf now hear
The lame will walk
The lost drawn near
And with new life
The dead are raised
All through the power in Jesus' name
The tired find rest
The sick are healed
The mysteries of
Our God revealed
And now the truth
Can be proclaimed
All through the power in Jesus' name
[Chorus: Mac Powell]
Name above all names
Savior and Our Lord
Every knee will bow and every tongue confess
No other name is given
By which we can be saved
Let us find our life and love in Jesus' name
