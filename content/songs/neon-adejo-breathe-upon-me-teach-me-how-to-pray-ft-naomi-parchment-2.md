Our father which at in heaven
Halloweth be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth
As it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us trespasses
Teach me how to pray
Teach me how to worship right
Lord I'm your baby
You called me your baby
Teach me how to pray
Teach me how to worship right
Lord I'm your baby
You called me your baby
Oh oh wooh oh oh
All I want is you
All I want is you
Breathe upon me
Breathe upon me
You're my everything
You're the life I live
Breathe upon me
Breathe upon me
Tell me what to say
Show me how to live for you
Lord I'm your baby
You called me your baby
All I want is you
All I want is you
Breathe upon me
Breathe upon me
So I can worship
So I can love like you
Just to closer
And to be more like you
So I can worship
So I can love like you
Just to be closer
And to be more like you
All I want is you
All I want is you
Breathe upon me
Breathe upon me
All I want is you
All I want is you
Breathe upon me
Breathe upon me
