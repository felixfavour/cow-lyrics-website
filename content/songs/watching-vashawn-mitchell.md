You know what's best for me
It's you who supplies my every need
So why worry about what tomorrow may bring
Since you watch over your word
You know what's best for me
It's you who supplies my every need
So I wont worry about what tomorrow may bring
Since you watch over your word
And just like your word,
You watch over me
You know what's best for me
It's you who supplies my every need
I wont worry about what tomorrow may bring
Since you watch over your word
You know what's best for me
It's you who supplies my every need
So I wont worry about what tomorrow may bring
Since you watch over your word
And just like your word,
You watch over me
You're watching
You're watching over me (Repeat)
