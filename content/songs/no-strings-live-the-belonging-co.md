You've already done enough
Gave Your life to show me love
You've already done enough
Only love would choose a grave
Pay what I could not repay
Jesus, what else can I say?
All I know is You're my everything
I will live for You and no one else
No catch, no strings, all I am I bring
I will live for You and no one else
(No one, no one but You)
(No one)
You've already done it all
Healed my heart and saved my soul
You've already donе it all
So from my next breath to my last
Nothing less than all I havе
I surrender all I am
All I know is You're my everything
I will live for You and no one else
No catch, no strings, all I am I bring
I will live for You and no one else
All I know is You're my everything
I will live for You and no one else
No catch, no strings, all I am I bring
I will live for You and no one else
