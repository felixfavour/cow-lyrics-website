There is only one
whose majesty is unending
There is only one
The king of kings, never failing
All, all arise at the name of our Saviour
who is worthy, you are worthy
There is only one
He's lifted high for the world to see
There is only one
one love alone overwhelms the grave
Yes your love alone overwhelms the grave All, all arise at the name of our Saviour
Who is worthy, you are worthy
All praise is yours
yours alone
The almighty, who is worthy, you are worthy.
There is power 2x at the sound of your name Jesus2x
at the sound of your name
All, all arise at the name of our Saviour
who is worthy, you're worthy
All praise is yours
yours alone
The almighty, who is worthy, you are worthy.
