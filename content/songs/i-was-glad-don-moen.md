I was glad when they said unto me
Let us go into Your house O Lord
No greater joy
Than to be in this place
To lift my voice and sing Your praise
Here we are in Your courts we stand
With our hearts and hands upraised
Here we are by the blood of the Lamb
By Your grace we come
And by Your grace we stand
