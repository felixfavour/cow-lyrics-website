My desire is to please You
To be more and more like You Jesus
Each and everyday, I lift my hands and say
"I want to be more like You"My desire is to please You
To be more and more like You Jesus
Each and everyday, I lift my hands and say
"I want to be more like You"I give You my life
Take me in Your arms and hold me Jesus
I give You my heart
I know that You can mend these broken pieces
I'm totally, I'm totally
Totally committed to You
My desire is to please You
To be more and more like You Jesus
Each and everyday, I lift my hands and say
"I want to be more like You"My desire is to please You
To be more and more like You Jesus
Each and everyday, I lift my hands and say
"I want to be more like You"
