[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Close my eyes, I'm trying to listen
Oh, 'cause it's been so long since I've heard You speak
[Pre-Chorus]
Send Your love, cover over the distance
Between You and me
Oh, how long must I wait for my love?
'Cause I need You, oh, I need You
My heart is bursting and breaking apart for my love, hah
Come on and blind my eyes, I'm looking to Heaven
Holding all Your promises against my chest
[Pre-Chorus]
I offer up the life I've been given
'Til my last breath
Oh, how long must I wait for my love?
'Cause I need You, oh, I need You
My heart is bursting and breaking apart for my love
