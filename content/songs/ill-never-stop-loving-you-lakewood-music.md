[Hook]
La-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la
Humbly I bow needing You now
Drawn by my desperation
Do I deserve this time you reserve
For friendship and conversation
Your voice unmistakable
I believe You when You say to me
I'll never, no never
I'll never ever stop loving You
My precious possession
There is no end to what we can do
Unconditional forever
I'll never stop loving You
Boldly I stand taking Your hand
Still drawn by my desperation
Longing to hear You calling me near
For friendship and conversation
Your voice unmistakable
I believe You when You say to me
