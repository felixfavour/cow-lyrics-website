In Your surrender
As You laid down Your life
You took up a sinner's cross
And Your life rescued mine
In this redemption
Love and mercy displayed
You lifted my eyes to see
That Your truth never fails
[Pre-Chorus]
Lord of the heavens
King of all days
Without You my world slips away
Redeemed by Your mercy
Consumed by Your grace
Now I live for You
Iâ€™m found in the arms of love
For Your love it saved my soul
I run to Your arms of love
Your light's gonna lead me home
