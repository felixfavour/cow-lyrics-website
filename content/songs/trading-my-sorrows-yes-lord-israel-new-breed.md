I'm trading my sorrows, and I'm trading my shame
And I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord
And I'm trading my sickness, and I'm trading my pain
I'm laying it, laying it, laying it down for the joy of the Lord
I'm trading my sorrows, I'm trading my shame
I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord
I'm trading my sickness, I'm trading my pain
I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord, Amen
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes, yes Lord, Amen
[Bridge]
I am pressed but not crushed
Persecuted, not abandoned
Struck down but not destroyed
And I am blessed beyond the curse
For His promise will endure
That His joy is going to be my strength
Though my sorrows may last for the night
His joy comes with the morning!
