[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Listen to the angels
Rejoicing ever so sweetly
Receiving Heaven's glory
The night that Christ was born
Listen to the angels
Rejoicing ever so sweetly
Receiving Heaven's glory
The night that Christ was born
Can't you see the people (
Coming from every nation
)
Coming from every nation (
Pleading for their salvation
)
Pleading for salvation (
The night that Christ
)
The night that Christ was born
[Interlude: Kirk Franklin, 
Choir
]
Hallelujah
Thank you, Jesus
The night that Christ
The night that Christ was born
Listen
Listen to the angels
Rejoicing ever so sweetly
Receiving Heaven's glory
The night that Christ was born
Can't you see the people
Coming from every nation
Pleading for salvation
The night that Christ was born
