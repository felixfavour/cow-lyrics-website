Eshe Oluwa, Eshe Baba o
Eshe Oluwa, Awadupe baba

You gave me shelter when I have no other
You made a way when there was no way
You turn my darkness into light
Awadupe Baba

You put food on my table Daddy
You comfort me when I was lost
Who can be compared unto you
Awadupe Baba

Awadupe baba o, Awadupe baba
Awadupe eledumare, Awadupe baba

Eshe Oluwa, Eshe Baba o
Eshe Oluwa, Awadupe baba

Baba eee, Baba wey dey for heaven now oh
We go praise you now Eee
We go praise you papa
