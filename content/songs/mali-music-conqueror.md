"Conqueror"
The enemy comes only to
Steal, kill and destroy
And because we don't know who and who's we are
We let him come and steal our joy
Yes, its true, we all fall short
But, still that gives us no excuse
Soon the enemy is fighting you
Just tell him to prepare to lose
Cuz' I'm...
More than a conqueror
More than a conqueror
More than a conqueror
More than a conqueror
Because of God's covenant with me
I'll always have the victory
No matter what you take from me..
God still get's glory from me
The kingdom's sufferin' violence
And the violence taketh by force
So, today we make a stand
Cuz' we're not takin' it no more
More than a conqueror [x11]
More than, more than, more than a conqueror [x6]
