In a world that?s lost and seeking
You?re the answer to every need, I know
It?s You alone
I find a hope for all my life
I?m living as a sacrifice, for You
In freedom and in truth
Pre-Chorus:
Always, I know
You are here and You live in me
In my life, You?re the only one I need
Jesus I believe
Chorus:
You?re the one who saved my soul
You gave me life, so I
Give it back to You
My God, God one and only
Now I stand in Your salvation
I keep the faith and I fix my life, on You
My hope is found in You
Jesus
