We've come alive we 've come alive we
Ever since you took the shame away
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Will never be the same again
The only one who brings lighting
To dead and make it rise again
Takes the old eggs and makes them brand new
Takes the filthy, makes it clean
Let's sing it loud now, 'cause we're alive
And You've given us a song to sing
We can't keep thriving 'cause there are some
That still need to be set free
Come on sing it, we're getting stronger
We're getting stronger
With You that's great
Here we go, we've come alive
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Ever since You took the shame away
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Will never be the same again
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Ever since You took the pain away
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Will never be the same again
Clap your hands like this
I'm singing loud, oh God
Singing loud now 'cause we're alive
And You've given us a song to sing (Can't keep silent, no)
We've kept this silence 'cause there are some
That still need to be set free
Come on, we're getting stronger now
We're getting stronger (With You it's great)
With You that's great (We feel Your power)
We feel Your power (Ooh!)
It's rising in us
Come on, come alive
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Ever since You took the shame away
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Will never be the same again
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Ever since You took the pain away
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Will never be the same again
We're getting stronger now
We're getting stronger (Oh yeah)
With You that's great (We feel Your power)
We feel Your power (It's rising in us, say it)
It's rising in us (Come on, we're getting stronger, say it)
We're getting stronger
With You that's great (We feel Your power)
We feel Your power (It's rising)
It's rising in us
Ooh, come on
Let me hear those hands
We're alive in here tonight
Come on let's try this out
Oh-oh, You make all things new
You gotta say it
Whoa-oh, You make all things new
Come on lift it up, every voice say "Oh God"
Whoa-oh, You make all things new
Every voice lift it up now
Whoa-oh, You make all things new
Every voice lift it at your God
Whoa-oh, You make all things new
Whoa-oh, You make all things new
Alright here we go, come on
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Ever since You took the shame away
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Will never be the same again
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Ever since You took the pain away
We've come alive we 've come alive we
Will never be the same again
Here we go, here we go
You're free now go
Hey, you're free now go
Hey, yeah
