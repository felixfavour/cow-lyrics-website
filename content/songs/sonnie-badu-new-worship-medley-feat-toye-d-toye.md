Be thou exalted oh Lord above the heavens,
Be thou exalted oh Lord above the earth,
Let your glory be above all the earth,
Let your glory be above all the earth.
Ancient of days, as old as You are,
As old as You are, You remain the same.
You will never never fail...(3X)
Jesus the same for ever.

Messiah... Messiah
Jesus... Jesus

King of heaven and earth.
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
Jesus... Jesus
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
King of heaven and earth.
