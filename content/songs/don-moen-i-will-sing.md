lord you seem so far away
a million miles or more it feels today
and though I haven't lost my faith I must confess right now that it's hard for me to pray
but I don't know what to say(what to say)
and I don't know where to start (where to start)
but as you give the grace,with all that's in my heart
chorus
I will sing
I will pray
even in my darkest hour
through the sorrow and the pain
I will sing
I will praise
lift my hands to honour you
because your word is true
I will sing
lord it's hard for me to see all the thoughts and plans you have for me
but I will put my trust in you knowing that you  died to set me free
but I don't know what to say
and I don't know where to start
but as you give the grace,with all that's in my heart
chorus
I will sing
I will pray
even in my darkest hour
through the sorrow and the pain
I will sing
I will praise
lift my hands to honour you
because your word is true(repeat)
