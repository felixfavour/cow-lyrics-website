Intro
And the Winner remains The  undefeatable King Jesus!
Verse 1
Why you wanna fight this battle yourself
When God says the battle is mine o o o
What you want is what you get anyway
In the name of Jesus
The battle is already won.
        Chorus
Because Wahala dey
 for who dey find Wahala
Trouble dey
 for who dey find trouble
Plenty dey
 for who too like enjoyment
Jesus dey
 for who want peace of mind
(When you hear the name Jesus
I just wanna see you bow down
When I call him Jehovah
I just wanna see you salute
When we sing hallelujah
I just wanna see you go violent (?)
To the old time champion
I just wanna see you praise him)Twice
It's not by power nor might it's by the Spirit of the Lord (spirit of the Lord )
He's the one fighting my battles and your battles
So let Him finish what he's started in your life
Make you ask dem say who can battle with the Lord.
