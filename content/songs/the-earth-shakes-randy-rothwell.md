[Chorus]
The earth shakes at the sound of His voice
The nations tremble before Him
The idols of men are all falling
At the feet of the Lord our God
At the feet of the Lord our God
The Lord is a Warrior, fearless is He
The Lord is mighty in battle
His armies outnumber his enemies
When they shout the strongholds of Satan come crashing down
And Babylon is falling, falling down
The earth shakes at the sound of His voice
The nations tremble before Him
The idols of men are all falling
At the feet of the Lord our God
At the feet of the Lord our God
The Lord is a Savior, gracious is He
The Lord is full of compassion
His army is also His family
When they shout the strongholds of Satan come crashing down
And Babylon is falling, falling down
