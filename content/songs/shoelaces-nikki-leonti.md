I'm falling down over my own sheolaces
Trying to run with the crowd
I'm head over heels in the wrong direction
Until now
Yeah while I'm thinkin about it here's what I see
Somehow there seems to be two of me
The one in the mirror
And one that's been redeemed
CHORUS
So liberate my heart
Emancipate my soul
Forgive the sin in me
And make me whole
Every now and then I go thru phases
When I'm like a bird flying free
Then all of a sudden the old man awakens
And captures me
And then the good that I would
Is not what I do
When goodnes sis with me
Evil is too
So I come to you, Father, asking this of you
