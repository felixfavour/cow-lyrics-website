[Chorus]
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive
I’m gonna sing to you dry bones
Until you’re covered in life
And the valley blooms
Like a rosebud in the light
Hear the call to attention
Feel the change in the air
For the ground is dry
But the clouds are overhead
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I’m gonna sing it again
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Come alive come alive come alive dry bones
Awake arise
Inhale the light
Come alive come alive
