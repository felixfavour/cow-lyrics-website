Oghene Doh, I Give You Praise Today
In every situation
With every trial
I have learnt to praise
Surely Your goodness and Your
Unending favor rest upon my days
My life is Yours
Here is my sacrifice of praise to You oh God
Great are You lord
And all Your wondrous work
I live to sing

There is no me without You
My ever present help in times of need
The glory of the morning
The sunshine and the darkness
Can't conceal
My life is yours
Here is my sacrifice of praise to You oh God
Great are you Lord
And all Your wondrous work
I live to sing
