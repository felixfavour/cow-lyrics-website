Great is the Lord God Almighty
Great is the Lord on high
The train of His robe fills the temple
And we cry out highest praise
[Pre-Chorus]
Glory to the risen King
Glory to the Son, glorious Son
Lift up your heads, open the doors
Let the King of glory come in
And forever be our God
Holy is the Lord God Almighty
Holy is the Lord on high
Let all the earth bow before You
And crown You Lord of all
[Pre-Chorus]
Glory to the risen King
Glory to the Son, glorious Son
Lift up your heads, open the doors
Let the King of glory come in
And forever be our God
Lift up your heads, open the doors
Let the King of glory come in
And forever be our God
