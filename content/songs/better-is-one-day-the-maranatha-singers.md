How lovely is Your dwelling place
Oh Lord Almighty
My soul longs
And even faints for You
For here my heart is satisfied
Within Your presence
I sing beneath
The shadow of Your wings
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Thousands elsewhere
One thing I ask
And I would seek
To see Your beauty
To find You in
The place Your glory dwells
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
My heart and flesh cry out
For You the living God
Your Spirit's water for my soul
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to You
I will draw near to You
Bridge...
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Thousands elsewhere
