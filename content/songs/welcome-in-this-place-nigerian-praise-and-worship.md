Welcome into this place
Welcome into this broken vessel
You desire to abide
In the praises of Your people
So we lift our hands
And we lift our hearts
As we offer up this praise
Unto Your name

Creation declares Your glory
And the universe proclaims Your majesty
Yet you choose to abide
In the praises of Your people
So we offer up this praise
Unto Your name
