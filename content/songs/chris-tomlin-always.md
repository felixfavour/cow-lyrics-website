I believe You gave sights to the blind
I believe that the dead came to life
I believe there were wonders and signs
And you're still the same
I believe every word that you said
I believe there were scars in your hands
That your goodness is good without end
And you'll never change
I will tell of your wonders
Sing of your grace
The God of creation
Knows me by name
The Lord is faithful
Yesterday, now, and always
Always
Your mercy is mighty
Age after age
And all generations
Will bow down and praise
The Lord is faithful
yesterday, now, and Always
Always
I believe you'll come in the clouds
I believe you were here even now
In your presence,
I know there is power
Power to say
oohhh
I will tell of your wonders
Sing of your grace
The God of Creation
Knows me by name
The Lord is faithful
Yesterday, now, and always
Always
Your mercy is mighty
Age after age
And all generations
Will bow down and praise
The Lord is faithful
Yesterday, now, and always
Always
You were!
You are!
You always will be God!
You were!
You are!
You always will be God!
Yes!, you always will be God!
I will tell of your wonders
Sing of your grace
The God of Creation
Knows me by name
The Lord is faithful
Yesterday, now, and always
Always
Your mercy is mighty
Age after age
And all generations
Will bow down and praise
The Lord is faithful
Yesterday, now, and always
Always
You were!
You are!
You always will be God!
You were!
You are!
You always will be God!
oh! You always will be God!
Your mercy is mighty
Age after age
And all generations
Will bow down and praise
The Lord is faithful
Yesterday, now, and always
