So what can I say
What can I do
But offer this heart, oh, God
Completely to You
So what can I say
What can I do, oh, Lord
But offer this heart, oh, God
Completely to You
You can take it from here
So I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the One who gave it all
So I'll stand
My soul, Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours
So I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the One who gave it all
So I'll stand
My soul, Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours
So I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the One who gave it all
So I'll stand
My soul, Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours
So I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the One who gave it all
So I'll stand
My soul, Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours
