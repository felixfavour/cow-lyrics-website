You call me strong and courageous
When I don't feel like I am
You could have turned me away
But You chose me instead
You say that I'm gonna make it
When I don't feel like I can
You see the battle I'm facing
And You're stepping in
[Chorus: Jonsal Barrientes & Tiffany Hudson]
You're in it with me, working through me
Fighting for me, God is not against me
You're in it with me, working through me
Fighting for me, God is not against me
I have a new revelation
A savior who calls me His friend
Oh, I used to fight on my own
But never again, oh no
'Cause I have a power that's greater
Than all of the enemy's lies
And I know the truth of the Gospel
That You're on my side, You're on my side
Oh
