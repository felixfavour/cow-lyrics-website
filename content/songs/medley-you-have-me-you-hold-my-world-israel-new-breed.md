Out on the farthest edge
There in the silence you were there
My faith was torn to shreds
My heart out of balance
And you were there
[Chorus:]
Always faithful
Always good
You still
Have me
You still have my heart
I thought I had seen the end everything broken
But you were there
I've wandered at Heaven's gate
I've made my bed in Hell
But you were there still
You have me
You have me
You have my heart completely (6x)
