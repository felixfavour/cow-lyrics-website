From my mouth oh God you commanded praise
You delight in me my praise is yours
With my heart my hands are lifted high
You have been so good I tell it all..(2)
Faithful God oh faithful God,  you deserve it all
None compares to your greatness Lord   you deserve it all (2)
Chorus:
I give you praise, praise
Praises from my heart
I give you praise, praise
You deserve it all
Instruments...
