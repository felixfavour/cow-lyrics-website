1: Holy Spirit descend in our midst,
Father in Heaven authorizes,
His work cometh quickly do come
down,
Show unto us all His ways,

2: Holy Spirit the living Spirit,
Descend unto us His children,
So we might praise Thee fervently,
At this moment and forever.

3: Holy Spirit, Spirit from heaven,
Father, the son, Holy Spirit,
Descend Thy power into this church,
That the living church be full of praise.
Amen
