God alone
The whole world belongs to you
Heaven and earth will sing your praise
All creation resound your fame
You oh lord art God alone
You are God
You are God and God alone
The whole world singing
You are God alone
I declare you're the king who reigns
Your kingdom forevermore
You spoke your word and all creation hear
All power belongs to you
You are God
You are God and God alone
The whole world singing
You are God alone
It belongs to you
It belongs to you
The world belongs to you
It belongs to you
It is yours
It is yours
It is yours
You are God
You are God and God alone
The whole world singing
You are God alone
