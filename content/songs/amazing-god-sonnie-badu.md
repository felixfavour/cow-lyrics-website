A thousand tongues wouldn't be enough to love you
Oh how great you've been to me

You are my well in the desert place
Oh King of Kings and Lord of Lords

So when trouble may come like floodgates
I know you're there for me
Deliverer
And when all of my clouds fade away
You'll lift me up
And set me free
