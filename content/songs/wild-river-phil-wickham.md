[Intro]
(Oh, oh-ooh)
There is a fountain
That never runs dry
Forever flows
With Water of Life
You never stop moving
You never stop moving
Where Your river runs, everything lives
And where Your river goes
Will never thirst again
You never stop moving
You never stop moving
Your mercy flows like a wild, wild river
Your love is strong like the raging sea
God, all Your goodness goes beyond all measure
Your grace like a flood, pouring out of me (Pouring out)
[Hook]
(Oh, oh-ooh)
(Oh, oh-ooh)
