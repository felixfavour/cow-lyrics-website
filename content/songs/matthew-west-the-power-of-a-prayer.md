Dear God it's me,
 calling out to You
Tonight I'm on my knees
Hoping You'll come though
These ones for my dad
Can You help him please?
The worlds made him mad at mom and me
And I'm asking You to bring his heart back home
Ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh, the power of a prayer
Mama's all I have, but she's alone again tonight
They always used to laugh
Now all they do is fight
She says I love that man
He's so far from You
She's done all she can
But she can't break through
And she's begging You
To bring his heart back home
Ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh, the power of a prayer
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, the power of a prayer
Just a whisper in the dark
Spoken to a broken heart
Holding on to one last strand of faith
Somewhere in the world right now
A desperate soul is crying out
Hoping Jesus really hears us
When we pray, ooh
Dear God, do You recognize my voice
I haven't talked to You since I was a little boy
Tonight I heard my son pray for his old man
That made me come undone made me understand
That only You can bring my heart back home
Ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh
Ooh, the power of a prayer
Ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh
Ooh, the power of a prayer
