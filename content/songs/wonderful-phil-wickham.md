I can see You in the light of a new dawn (A new dawn-)
I can hear You in the words of a love song (A love song-)
I know it in my heart, I know it in my soul
I can feel You in the breath of a newborn (A newborn-)
And I can feel You in the wind and the rainstorm (Rainstorm-)
[Pre-Chorus]
I know it in my heart
I know it in my soul
Oh-ooh, You are Wonderful
And what else can my soul sing
All Your hands have made
Everything You've done
Oh, my God, You're Wonderful
You were there when the Heavens were fashioned
You spoke a word, and You set it all in motion
[Pre-Chorus]
I know it in my heart
I know it in my soul
