You're the Lord of all Creation
God You made me in Your Image
And I'm just a Reflection
Of the Love that I've been given
Everybody wants to be Somebody
I wanna be Somebody too
If I'm gonna be known for Something
I wanna be known for You
    
I wanna be the Moon
Up among the Stars
Fly Around the World,
Lighting up the dark of Night
I'm nothing without the Son's
Amazing Grace On everything I do
If You're Shining on me
I'm Shining Right back for You
I wanna be the Moon
Lord I wanna be the moon for You
    
Yea there's gonna be
Some Cloudy days
Sometimes it's gonna Cover up
The Work You're doing in me
But still with every Breath I Breathe
    
I wanna be the Moon
Up among the Stars
Fly Around the World,
Lighting up the dark of Night
I'm nothing without the Son's
Amazing Grace On everything I do
If You're Shining on me
I'm Shining Right back for You
I wanna be the Moon
Lord I wanna be the moon for You
    [Bridge]
Everybody wants to be Somebody
I wanna be Somebody too
If I'm gonna be known for Something
I wanna be known for You
    
(I wanna be the Moon
Up among the Stars
Fly Around the World,
Lighting up the darkest Night) [x2]
I'm nothing without the Son's
Amazing Grace On everything I do
If You're Shining on me
I'm Shining Right back for You
I wanna be the Moon
Yeah I wanna be the moon for You
Lord I wanna be the moon for You
