I've lived stories that have proved Your faithfulness
I've seen miracles my mind can't comprehend
And there is beauty in what I can't understand
Jesus it's You, Jesus it's You
I believe
You're the wonder-working God
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Too good to not believe, oh
And I can't resurrect a man with my own hands
But just the mention of Your name can raise the dead (Yeah)
All the glory to the only One who can
Jesus it's You, Jesus it's You (Come on)
Oh, I believe
You're the wonder-working God (Yes, You are)
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not believe (Too good)
Too good to not believe (Come on)
Too good to not believe
After everything I've seen
You're too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Too good to not believe (After everything I've seen You do)
(Oh, God)
Yes, I believe
I believe, I believe it
Oh, I believe
We've seen cancer disappear
We've seen broken bodies healed
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
We've seen real life resurrection
We've seen mental health restored
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
We've seen families reunited
We've seen prodigals return (Come home)
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it (Don't you ever tell me)
We've seen troubled souls delivered
We've seen addicts finally free (Finally free)
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
We'll see cities in revival
And salvation flood the streets (Come on)
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
We'll see glory fill the nations
Like the world has never seen
Don't you tell me He can't do it
'Cause I know that He can
Yes, I believe
You're the wonder-working God (Oh, You are)
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe (Too good)
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles
