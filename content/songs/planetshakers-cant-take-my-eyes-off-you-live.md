The more I behold You
The more I become like You, Jesus
With no veil between us
Boldly I run to You, Jesus
I can't take my eyes off You
I can't take my eyes off You
I can't turn my heart from You
Jesus You're beautiful
You stand before me in radiant glory
And I can't look away
Jesus in Your presence
Beholding Your greatness
As I see You
I am changed
As I see You
I am changed
The holy of holies
Is where You are calling me, Jesus
Now into Your image
You are transforming me, Jesus
I can't take my eyes off You
I can't take my eyes off You
I can't turn my heart from You
'Cause Jesus You're beautiful
You stand before me in radiant glory
And I can't look away
Jesus in Your presence
Beholding Your greatness
As I see You
I am changed
As I see You
I am changed
From glory to glory
From healing to healing
From freedom to freedom
As I see You I am changed
From breakthrough to breakthrough
There's nothing You can't do
Oh Jesus I love You
As I see You I am changed
From glory to glory
From healing to healing
From freedom to freedom
As I see You I am changed
From breakthrough to breakthrough
There's nothing You can't do
Oh Jesus I love You
As I see You I am changed
You stand before me in radiant glory
And I can't look away
Jesus, in Your presence
Beholding Your greatness
As I see You
I am changed
As I see You
I am changed
As I see You
I am changed
As I see You
I am changed
