[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Father God, we bless you in the temple
We love You for your kindness
We love You for Your love
For Your grace has been better than life
We worship You, we adore You
For You've shown us many ways
And we thank You for Your kindness
Father God, we kiss thy presence in the temple
For Your love has been better than life
That is why we love You so, more than life to me
[Chorus: Choir, 
Kirk Franklin
]
(
Savior
) Savior more than life to me
You are the joy and air I breathe
No other lover shall there be
That makes my spirit sing (
Hold me close
)
Hold me close, don't let me go
You're the only friend I'll ever know
That is why I love You so
More than life to me
More than life to me
[Chorus: Choir, 
Kirk Franklin
]
(
Savior
) Savior more than life to me
You are the joy and air I breathe (
No other lover
)
No other lover shall there be (
That makes my spirit sing
)
That makes my spirit sing (
Fellas, hold me close
)
Hold me close, don't let me go
(Hold me close, don't let me go)
You're the only friend I'll ever know
(The only friend I'll ever know) (
That is why
)
That is why I love You so (
More than life
)
More than life to me
More than life to me
