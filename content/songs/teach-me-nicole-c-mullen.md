I won't pretend I've figured it out
I won't pretend I never have doubts
I come like a child exposing my heart
Full of joy and pain from which I cry out
Teach me Lord, what I should know
Lead me Lord, where I should go
Show Me God, what I should do
'Cause I want to worship you
In spirit and truth
When I'm thirsty and the river is dry
When I'm longing for the fountain of life
You offer me the spring that won't fail
You're the water and I'm at the well
Search me and know me
Jehovah Lord of Life
As I offer this body
A living sacrifice
