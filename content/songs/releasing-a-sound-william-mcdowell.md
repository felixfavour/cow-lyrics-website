William McDowell – The Sound Of Heaven Lyrics
Sound of Heaven
There is a sound
Sound of hope
Sound of love
Drawing all to come
There is a sound
Sound of joy
Sound of peace
Flowing out of me
Sound to heal the broken heart
Comfort for the least of these
Justice for the lawless
Righteousness and ever flowing stream
For the fatherless the widows and the orphans
To hear the sound
We will release the sound of heaven
They’re crying
They’re seeking
They’re searching
For the sound of heaven
They’re calling
They’re watching
They’re waiting
For the sound of heaven
They’re hungry
They’re thirsty
They’re desperate
For the sound of heaven
We will release the sound
We will release the sound
We will release the sound
Of heaven
[Repeat until end]
