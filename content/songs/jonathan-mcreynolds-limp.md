mmmm.... mmmm.....
I'm tired,
broken,
innocence stolen,
and I know I'm a different man.
See life hits, and life hurts, think i've seen some life's worst,
but you've been here so you understand.
see I fell and I broke something, but I couldn't tell 'cause I kept running away from your love 'nd grace.
so my trips, nd my pain, my failure they only made me desperate, to seek your face...
the devil hoped these injuries will make me stop.
