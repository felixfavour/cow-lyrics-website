Let Him turn it in your favor
Watch Him work it for your good
'Cause He's not done with what He's started
He's not done until it's good
So let Him turn it in your favor
Watch Him work it for your good
He's not done with what He's started
He's not done until it's good
[Chorus: Brandon Lake]
Hello peace, hello joy, hello love
Hello strength, hello hope, it's a new horizon
Hello peace, hello joy, hello love
Hello strength, hello hope, it's a new horizon
If you're ready for a breakthrough
Just open up and just recеive
'Cause what He's pouring out is nothing
You'vе ever seen (
You've ever seen
), You've ever seen
[Chorus: Chandler Moore & Brandon Lake]
Hello peace, hello joy, hello love (hello)
Hello strength, hello hope, it's a new horizon (can you see the sun coming up)
Hello peace, hello joy, hello love
Hello strength, hello hope, it's a new horizon
