Precious Jesus, now I love you
How I lift high my voice, with your praise
Holy Spirit, I implore thee
Drench my heart as my lips part your praise
I am persuaded, Lord to love you
I have been changed, to bless your name
I am constrained by this great gospel
Forever to worship you
Bless the Lord
Oh my soul
And all that is within me
Bless His holy name
Hallelu, Hallelujah
Oh Lord we praise your name
All the Glory, All the praise
All the glory, all the praise
All the glory, All the praise
Oh Lord we praise your name
Oh Lord we praise your name
The Lord is here, the lord is here
He has established his name
And it shall reign forever
And it shall reign forever
