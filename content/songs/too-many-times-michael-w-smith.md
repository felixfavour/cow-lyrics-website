Who do I hope to finally be?
Is it not your life in me?
Yet the how's too hard to see
Too many times
Will I ever finally be
The true, intented me?
And the old in me be freed
And left behind?
(Chorus)
Too many times
I'm back inside
Wanting desperately to hide
Yet i know, i know you say
You have to die
Too many times
You hear my cries
I'm at the end of all my tries
So, i'm open Lord, so
Teach me how to die
Here I am again alone
Afraid i'll lose all that i own
Yet you see me as your own
I cannot fall
