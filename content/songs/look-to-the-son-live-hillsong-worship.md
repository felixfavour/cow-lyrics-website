[Chorus]
Oh we look to the Son
Set our eyes on our Saviour
See the image of love
Sing His praises forever
Oh we look to the Son
Oh we look to the Son
Salvation, tearing through the dead of night
See the kingdom burst into colour at the speed of light
Freedom, shaking up the atmosphere
As the shadows fade into nothing as the day appears
[Pre-Chorus]
Beyond the skies above
Love reaching out for us
The Everlasting One
Jesus our God
Oh we look to the Son
Set our eyes on our Saviour
See the image of love
Sing His praises forever
Oh we look to the Son
