I'ma teach you your part, alright
Your line is: Fall in love again
That's your line, okay
Every time I think of all the ways that you've made
I (fall in love again) wow
Every time I think of all the ways that you've made
I (fall in love again), ah
And when I think that all is lost
You always know what to say
And I (fall in love again)
You make it look so easy
The way you never let us slip through your hands, ey
You make my heart keep seeking
'Cause it feels good to know I'm a part of your plan, yes
And I am more in love with you each day
(Every time I)
Every time I think of all the ways that you've made I
Fall in love again
And when it feels like all is lost You always know what to say
I fall in love again
(You are the great crea-)
You are the great creator
(And you formed it all by)
Formed it all by speaking your word
(Yes you're God, yes you're King)
(You're the perfect healer, oh God)
Yes you're the perfect healer
(And I can always count)
And I can always count on you to be there
(Oh my goodness, I grow more and more in love with you everyday, oh Lord)
And I am more in love with you each day
