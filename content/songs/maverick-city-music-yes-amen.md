Intro: Chandler Moore]
You're a man of Your word, yes, You are
All of Your promises are "Yes" and "Amen"
If You said it, we believe it
Father of kindness
You have poured out grace
You have brought me out of darkness
You have filled me with peace
Giver of mercy
You're my help in time of need
Lord, I can't help but sing
Let's sing aloud
Faithful, You are
Faithful, forever You will be
Faithful, You are (Sing aloud)
All Your promises are "Yes" and "Amen" (Oh yeah yeah)
All Your promises are "Yes" and "Amen"
Hold on, second verse
Beautiful Savior
You have brought me near
You pulled me from the ashes
You have broken every curse
Blessed Redeemer
You have set this captive free
Lord, I can't help but sing
And we say faithful, You are
Faithful, forever You will be (Yeah)
Faithful, You are (We believe and we know that)
All Your promises are "Yes" and "Amen" (Say faithful)

If You said it, we will see it
So glad You're still speaking
So glad You're still speaking
You're still revealing
And You're still fulfilling
You're still revealing and You're still fulfilling
We will walk in what You say
We will live in what You say
'Cause if You said it, we will see it
We believe it
Yeah, what You say
