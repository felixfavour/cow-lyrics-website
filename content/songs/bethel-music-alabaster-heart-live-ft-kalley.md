So here it is, my alabaster heart
I'm keeping nothing back from who You are
No hidden treasure veiled by key or lock
You're a lifetime worth of worship and that's only just the start
And here it is, my every waking day
The minutes, hours, the years of endless praise
For You're worthy far beyond all I could say
There's a lifetime worth of worship in the nuance of Your names

So let it rise like incense
My whole life, a fragrance
Every ounce here broken at Your feet
Every breath, an offering
My heart cries, these lungs sing over You
My worthy King of kings
There it is, Your alabaster cross
Giving all You are for all I'm not
I can't believe that's the kind of King You are
How could I not bring a lifetime worth of worship to You, God?

Oh, let it rise like incense
My whole life, a fragrance
Every ounce here broken at Your feet
Every breath, an offering
My heart cries and these lungs sing over You
Oh, my worthy King of kings
Sing let it rise
So let it rise like incense
My whole life a fragrance
Every ounce here broken at Your feet
Every breath is my offering
And my heart cries and these lungs sing over You
My worthy King of kings
[Spontaneous]
We're gonna lay it all down
We're gonna bring it all now
[Bridge]
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
Oh, You can have it all
Oh, You can have it all
Oh, You can, You can have it all

So let it rise like incense
My whole life a fragrance
Every ounce here broken at Your feet
Every breath, an offering
My heart cries, these lungs sing over You
Oh, my worthy King of kings
Bring it to You
Oh, let it rise like incense
My whole life a fragrance
Every ounce here spilled out at Your feet
And every breath is my offering
And my heart cries and these lungs sing over You
Oh, my worthy King of kings
So worthy You are, now
[Bridge]
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You've proven Your worth time and time again
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
I know I can trust You
You can have it all
All my love, all my love, all my love
I know I can trust You
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
All my heart, all my soul, all I own
You can have it all
Bring it all, lay it down tonight
You can have it all
'Cause You are worthy of it all
Every last drop, everything I have, yes
You are worthy of it all
