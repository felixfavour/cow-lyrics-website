thers a times am rising high, I win
Through the testing trials of life, I win
Make more mistakes,when I bow my head
Am only working how to come back now
Becos he lives in me I win
Though am pressed on every side, I win
Though I got wounded in the fight, I win
I don't want and i don't feel, cos winning is name,becos he live in me I win
I win today
And I win tomorrow
Theres a time am rising high I win
When the rest are casting down, I will be lifted high... Becos he lives in me I live
See The way some try to break me.... I win
All the house are against me -I win
In midst of depression,my soul shall soar high..
Becos he lives in me I win
When the rest are casting down, I win
When every thing seems upside down, I win
Though am so riding by my foes, I know that victory is sure, bcoz he lives in me I win...
I win today and I win tomorrow
There's a times am rising high,i win
When the rest are casting down,i wil be lifted up... Becos he lives in me.. I win
I posses in me eternal life, the life of God, that cannot die
That is how I win before the game begins..wimning is my name  victory is my name
I declare am the righteousness of God
The offspring of the great I am.
I wil win 1 time
2.3times...for ever!And ever!!!!!for ever
I made it I win
I made it
I winnnnnn
ohohhhh
uhuhuhuh ahahh
I win
I made it
All the tither are rising high
I win
I made it
All the rest are casting down...
I will be lifted high becos He lives in me
I winn
I win today, and I win tomorrow.....
