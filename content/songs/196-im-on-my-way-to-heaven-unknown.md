I'm on my way to Heaven my journey gets sweeter every day. I'm walking with Jesus, talking with Jesus, all along the way. My soul gets so happy, I shout and I sing night and day. I'm on my way to Heaven and the journey gets sweeter everyday.

I've had ups and downs, sorrows and frowns may pass my way, but I've paid no attention, dropped the contention, had no time to stray. Problems only seem to weigh me down, turn my sunny skies to gray. But I'm on my way to heaven, and the journey gets sweeter everyday. 

I'm on my way to Heaven my journey gets sweeter every day. I'm walking with Jesus, talking with Jesus, all along the way. My soul gets so happy, I shout and I sing night and day. I'm on my way to Heaven and the journey gets sweeter everyday.

God was good enough to save me, washed my old sins away. Now he leads me and guides me, protects me and hides me, keeps me each day. I know that He loves me, for He entered my heart to stay. Well, I'm on my way to Heaven, and my  journey gets sweeter everyday. 

I'm on my way to Heaven my journey gets sweeter every day. I'm walking with Jesus, talking with Jesus, all along the way. My soul gets so happy, I shout and I sing night and day. I'm on my way to Heaven and the journey gets sweeter everyday.
