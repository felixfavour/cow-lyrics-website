Praise Him you stars above
Galaxies all in motion
Praise Him you thunderclouds
Ringing throughout the Heavens
From every mountaintop
To every wild ocean
Oh, hear all the universe sing praise
Oh, sing praise
Let everything that breathes
Let all the earth proclaim
Great is the Lord our God
Praise Him forever
Let all that is within me
Magnify His name
Great is the Lord our God
Praise Him forever
Praise Him forever
Praise Him you beating hearts
Sing for the life He's given
Praise Him you rescued ones
Join in the sound of Heaven
From every mountaintop
To every wild ocean
Oh, hear all the universe sing praise
