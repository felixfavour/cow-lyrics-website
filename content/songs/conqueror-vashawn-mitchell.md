Spoken:
This song is to remind you of the winner within
Regardless of what you've seen
Regardless of what you've heardYou are a conqueror
You are the head and not the tailAbove and not beneath
The first and not the last
You are a conqueror, a conqueror
A CONQUEROR
I have the power over the enemy
No weapon formed shall prosper against me
Greater is he that is within me
In the end I'll recieve what he has for me
Chorus:
I am a conqueror
Through him that loves meI have the victory
I won't be defeated
(Ohhh ohhh)
I'll keep on believing
(Yea Yea)
Every work started in me shall be completed
I am a conqueror
(Conqueror)
Conqueror
(Conqueror)
Conqueror
(Conqueror)
Conqueror
(Conqueror)
Conqueror
(Conqueror)
Conqueror
