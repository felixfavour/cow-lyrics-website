I've never thought I was worthy of your grace
But you gave it to me anyway
And if I took all day
It wouldn't be long enough for me
To express my gratitude
You never remind me of my mistakes
But you show me my destiny
Chorus:
What an awesome God you are
You're an awesome, awesome God
What an awesome God you are
You're an awesome, awesome God
You hold the world in your hand
Such an awesome God you are
The winds and the waves obey your command;
What a mighty God you are
(Chorus 3x, worship leader ad lib)
Ending:
There is no one like you, God
You're awesome, so awesome
Who am I that you're mindful of me?
What and awesome God you are
(2x)
You're awesome...so awesome...
You're awesome...so awesome...
What an awesome God you are
What an awesome God you are
You're an awesome, awesome God
