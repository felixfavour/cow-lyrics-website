"See the Teacher sitting on a mountain
And see Him walking along the shore
His friends and disciples are gathering around Him
Never spake a man like this before
But why is a man as wise as He
Weeping alone in Gethsemane
Could it be because He's afraid we'd never see
The heaven in His eyes
See the Master walking on the water
And hear Him speak and calm an angry wave
Look at Him raising of Jairus's daughter
And with a word Lazarus comes forth from the grave
And why is a man is strong as this
Being betrayed by a good friend's kiss
Could it be because this man missed
The heaven in His eyes
And I'm not talking about your pie in the sky
That you good boys and girls get in the by and by
But rather the strength that we could find
If you've got the guts to try
See the Teacher playing with the children
And see Him baffle the doctors of the law
Look at the people gathering to go with Him
Those who see the vision that He saw
