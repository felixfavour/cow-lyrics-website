It's so easy to forget
The victories of the past
and focus on the trials of the moment
It's so easy to complain and talk about the pain
and forget his goodness and his mercies
But when I look over my shoulder to see how far you brought me
It so clear, you have been faithful all along uh uh uh
So I will not hold back my worship even through the raging storms
I will open up my mouth and give you praise...!!!
I remember, remember your goodness
I remember, remember your love
I remember, remember your faithfulness
I remember, remember your grace

oh oh
If it wasn't for your grace
that stepped into my space
and turned around my ugly situation(hehehe)
I was lost in far away
But then you came my way
how can I forget how you have saved me?
Sometimes life can be so busy
and sometimes overwhelmed
that we take our eyes away
from all you have done
but this boy that you have lifted out of darkness into light, hhhhhhu
I will never cease to testify your good...
I remember, remember your goodness
I remember, remember your love...oooooh
I remember, remember your faithfulness
I remember, remember your grace
