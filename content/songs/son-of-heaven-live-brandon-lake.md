This is the word, here in the flesh
Living among the meek and lowly
The voice of God, His every breath
Salvation of the world unfolding
[Chorus: Brandon Lake]
Behold Him, behold Him
Lift up your eyes see the Son of Heaven
Hosanna, Hosanna
Pour out your praise, sing the name of Jesus
Hey
This is His heart upon the cross
And from His wounds His mercies flowing (Yeah)
And from the dawn, put death to death
And ever since that graveâ€™s been empty (Yeah)
[Chorus: Brandon Lake]
Behold Him, behold Him
Lift up your eyes see the Son of Heaven
Hosanna, Hosanna
Pour out your praise, sing the name of Jesus
Behold Him, behold Him
Lift up your eyes see the Son of Heaven (See the Son of heaven)
Hosanna, Hosanna
Pour out your praise, sing the name of Jesus
Oh sing His name
We love Your name
