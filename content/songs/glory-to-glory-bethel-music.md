Created from dust
And You came and You lived among us
You took on our frame, You walked in our pain
And now You're taking us higher
You stepped into time
And You laid down Your life to save us
And You took on our shame
On the Cross it was laid
And now You're taking us higher
'Cause we go from glory to glory to glory
We'll never be the same, we'll never be the same
We go from glory to glory to glory
We're forever changed, forever changed
And You called me Your friend
And brought into Your endless kingdom
And by the blood I was made no longer a slave
And now You're taking us higher
We go from glory to glory to glory
We'll never be the same, never be the same
'Cause we go from glory to glory to glory
We're forever changed, forever changed
