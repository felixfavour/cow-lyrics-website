Spirit of wisdom, open my eyes again
Spirit of revelation, open my heart again
Spirit of wisdom, open my eyes again
Spirit of revelation, open my heart again
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I wanna see
Lord, I wanna see
See You rightly, Jesus
Oh, I wanna see
Lord, I wanna see
See You rightly, Jesus
[Interlude]
We wanna see
Open up our eyes, Lord
Open up our eyes, Lord
'Cause I know that Your eyes are like flames of fire
I know that Your head is white as wool
I know that Your voice, it sounds like watеrs
Jesus, You're beautiful
And I know that Your еyes are like flames of firе
I know that Your head is white as wool
And I know that Your voice, it sounds likе waters
Jesus, You're beautiful
