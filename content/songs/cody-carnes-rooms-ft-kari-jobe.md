I want to go where I've never been
I want to see Your mysteries before my eyes
I want to know the secrets that You know
I want to hear the melodies of heaven
I'm after the rooms of Your heart
I'm after the rooms of Your heart
I'm after the rooms of Your heart
That are waiting to be found
You're waiting to be found
I want to move where Your spirit moves
I want to dive into the depths of who You are
Oh, I could search for a thousand years
I would never reach the limits of Your love
I'm after the rooms of Your heart
I'm after the rooms of Your heart
I'm after the rooms of Your heart
That are waiting to be found
You're waiting to be found
I'll never stop chasing You
I won't relent in my pursuit
I'll never stop chasing You (I won't stop)
I won't relent in my pursuit (I won't stop)
I'll never stop chasing You (I won't stop)
I won't relent in my pursuit (I won't stop)
I'll never stop chasing You (I won't stop)
I won't relent in my pursuit
I'm after the rooms of Your heart
I'm after the rooms of Your heart
I'm after the rooms of Your heart
That are waiting to be found
You're waiting to be found
