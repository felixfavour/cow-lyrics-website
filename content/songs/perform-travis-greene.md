Get it right everyday
Do it perfect end they will love me
They will want me back
If I make no mistakes
A performance that’s perfect for the crowd
You’ll be proud of me right?
But You don’t need me on stage to love me
No matter the place Your heart will be true
When I’m afraid that I am not good enough, and I don’t know what to do
Truth is
I don’t have to perform for You
Cue the lights center stage
It’s the moment that they will see me
They will want me back
Every word that I say
Every note must be just right for the crowd
And You’ll be proud of me right?
But You don’t need me on stage to love me
No matter the place Your heart will be true
When I’m afraid that I am not good enough
I will keep my eyes on You
In spite of mistakes You want me
Rid me of shame and give me Your truth
When I’m afraid that I am not good enough and I don’t know what to do
Truth is
I don’t have to perform for You
