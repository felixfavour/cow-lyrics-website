Shelter In ft DOE
I say of the Lord
You will cover me in strength
Keep me underneath your wings
Arrows fly by day
In your shadow, I am safe
Angels guard my way
So I will not fear
The terror of night
It will not come near
Your presence is light
I find refuge
In love
You're my fortress
My God in whom I trust
I take shelter
In your name
Amazing grace
My hiding place
I say of the Lord
Though destruction plague the day
The name of Jesus saves
Enemies beware
He will save me from the snare
No harm can tarry here
So I will not fear
The terror of night
It will not come near
Your presence is light
I find refuge
In your love
You're my fortress
My God in whom I trust
I take shelter
In your name
Amazing grace
My hiding place
Amazing grace
My hiding place
I hear you say
Because you love me
I will rescue you
I'll deliver you
I hear you say
Because you call me
I will answer you
I'll fight for you
I hear you say
Because you love me
I will rescue you
I'll deliver you
I hear you say
Because you call me
I will answer you
I'll fight for you
I hear you say
Although one thousand may fall
Ten thousand more
I stand secure
I hear you say
No harm will come to your life
I will satisfy
Watch salvation rise, oh-oh-oh-oh
I find refuge
In your love
You're my fortress
My God in whom I trust
I take shelter
In your name
Amazing grace
My hiding place
Amazing grace
My hiding place
I hear you say
Because you love me
I will rescue you
I'll deliver you
I hear you say
Because you know my name
El Shaddai is near
Elohim is here
