Your love is enough for me
Whoo!
Yeah, alright
Long ago, so far away
I used to worry, I used to fear
I thought I had it all together
Now the picture is, oh, so clear
Making decisions on my own
Got me nowhere, but too far gone
From my sorrow and my despair
Through the dark, I finally saw You there
Love is enough for me
(Love is, is enough for me)
(Nothing can take, take His love from me)
Nothing can take me from Your love
Can't they see
Love is enough for me
(Love is, is enough for me)
(All that I am, I'm ever, ever gonna need)
All that I'm ever gonna need at all
Love is enough, oh, yeah
Now I'm livin', really livin'
Finally giving my all to You
No more shame, no more games
Have to sing, 'cause I know
I've found the truth
I've gotta tell it, I can't hold back
This love You've given, it knows no lack
From my sorrow and my despair
Through the dark, I finally saw You there
