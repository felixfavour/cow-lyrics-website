Let now the weak say I have strength
By the Spirit of pow'r
That raised Christ from the dead
Let now the poor stand and confess
That my portion in Him
And I'm more then blessed
Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our King
Chorus:
We love You, Lord
We Worship You
You are our God
You alone are good
Let now Your church shine as your bride
That You saw in Your heart
As You offered up Your life
Let now the lost be welcome home
By the saved and redeemed
Those adopted as Your own
Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our King
