Open up my eyes to see
All of You, Your mysteries
I hold my breath, You hold my hand
As Heaven melts the heart of man
[Pre-Chorus]
How amazed I am
Your glory fills the sky
A great and holy light
Shining like a million stars
I'm amazed by who You are
Lord, we lift You high
Oh God, be magnified
You have overwhelmed my heart
I'm amazed by who You are
The universe is at Your feet
And angels bow when You speak
So high above our greatest song
But still You call, and we will come
[Pre-Chorus]
How amazed I am
