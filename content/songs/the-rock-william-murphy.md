CHORUS
We will not be shaken
We will not be moved
We will stand on the rock of our salvation
We will not be shaken
We will not be moved
We will trust in the God of our salvation
We set our hope on Jesus
Christ our cornerstone
In Him we safely rest
His love unbreakable
We build our faith on Jesus
Your name and that alone
It's been our firm foundation
Our courage is Your throne
I know You'll never fail me
On You I can depend
I know Your plan is perfect
I'm glad You call me friend
You've been my help in crisis
You are the one I call
I'm standing on Your promise
You are the Lord of all
