[Intro]
Woah, woah
Our God is greater
Our God is greater
Water You turned into wine
Opened the eyes of the blind
There's no one like You
None like You
Into the darkness, You shine
Out of the ashes, we rise
There's no one like You
None like You
Oh yeah
Our God is greater, our God is stronger
God, You are higher than any other
Our God is healer, awesome in power
Our God, our God
Oh yeah
Into the darkness, You shine
Out of the ashes, we rise
There's no one like You
None like You
Oh yeah
