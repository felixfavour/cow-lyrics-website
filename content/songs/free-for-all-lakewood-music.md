Rivers rich in mercy beckon
Everyone who thirsts is welcome
All who hunger freely come
Bread of Life for ev'ryone
[Pre-Chorus]
It's free for all
Free for all
Over every limitation
Free for all
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is freedom, free for all
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is freedom, free for all
Free for all
We're proclaiming freedom to the nations
Stand and see your full salvation
Rivers in the desert clouds are forming
Celebrate this free outpouring
[Bridge]
Holy Spirit rise within us
Bring Your freedom, free for all
Holy Spirit rise within us
Bring Your freedom, free for all
Free for all
