With open hearts and lifted hands
We wait for You to move again
Here and now make Your presence known
Let the darkness flee and the giants fall
Let Your kingdom come, as we surrender all
Here and now make Your presence known
King of heaven
You are welcome in this place
We wanna see Your kingdom come
Move in power
Holy Spirit have Your way
We wanna see Your kingdom come
We turn our eyes to see Your face
Be lifted high upon our praise
Here and now Jesus be enthroned
King of heaven
You are welcome in this place
We wanna see Your kingdom come
Move in power
Holy Spirit have Your way
We wanna see Your kingdom come
