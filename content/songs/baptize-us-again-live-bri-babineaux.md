[Intro: Bri Babineaux & 
Todd Dulaney
]
I want you all to help me welcome my brother Todd Dulaney to the stage, come on
Ye', yes, O God
It's uncontainable
What we feel inside
This hunger that won't die
It's undeniable
How much we need of You
This is our hearts' desire
[Interlude]
It's uncontainable
What we feel inside
This hunger that won't die
It's undeniable
How much we need of You
This is our hearts' desire
[Pre-Chorus: Bri Babineaux]
Oh, this one thing that we long for
To encounter all You are
We've had a taste but we want more
Lord, we're ready now
