How I long
To breathe the air of heaven
Where pain is gone
And mercy fills the street
To look upon
The one who bled to save me
And walk with him
For all eternity
There will be a day
We all will bow before him
There will be a day
When death will be no more
Standing face to face
With He who died and rose again
Holy,holy is the Lord
And every prayer
We prayed in desperation
The songs of faith
We sang through doubt and fear
In the end
We'll see that it was worth it
When he returns
To wipe away our tears
There will be a day
We all will be before Him
There will be a day
When death will be no more
Standing face to face
With He who died and rose again
Holy,holy is the Lord
And on that day
We join the resurrection
And stand beside
The heroes of the faith
With one voice
A thousand generations
Sing Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
(2 times)
Forever He shall reign
So let it be today
We shout the hymn of heaven
With angels and the saints
We raise a mighty roar
Glory to our God
Who gave us life beyond the grave
Holy,holy is the Lord
(2 times)
Holy,holy is the Lord (2 times)
