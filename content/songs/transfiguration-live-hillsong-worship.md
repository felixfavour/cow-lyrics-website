From the cloud You speak
What was veiled now is seen
Jesus the image of
The invisible God
Divinity confirmed
In the transfigured Word
A kingdom once concealed
On the earth now revealed
(Come on, we sing)
Holy is the Lord revealed before my eyes
And my burning heart can scarcely take it in
As I behold Your beauty with unworthy eyes
The only song my soul can find to sing
Is hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, my King
Lead my longing heart
To the high ground, to a clear view
And in awe, I'll be there
Beholding You
