Are you hurting and broken within,
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sins,
Jesus Is calling,
Have you come to end of yourself
Do you thirst for a drink from the well,
Jesus is calling
Chorus:
O come to the altar the Father's arms are open wide,
Forgiveness was brought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ
2.Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
Come today there's no reason to wail
Jesus is calling
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes a new life is born
Jesus is calling
Chorus:O come to the altar the Father's arms are open wide ,
Forgiveness was brought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ
3.And what a Saviour isn't He wonderful, sing Alleluia Christ is risen,
Bow down before Him for H,Oe is Lord of all,
Sing Alleluia Christ is risen,
Ooh what a Saviour isn't He wonderful,
Sing Alleluia Christ is risen,
Chorus : O come to the altar the Father's arms are open wide ,
Forgiveness was brought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ,
O come to the altar the Father's arms are open wide Forgiveness was brought we the precious blood of Jesus Christ
