We made it, we survived
When the enemy came in to threaten our lives
God lifted a standard
Devine protection
No weapon formed
Shall prosper against us
I made it this far, by faith
My future's brighter than my today
I'm holding on to my praise, I made it
I survived
I'm a Survivor!!(x3)
Let's Stand in liberty
Let's Walk in unity
Let's Pray continually
We made it
We made it (x3)
