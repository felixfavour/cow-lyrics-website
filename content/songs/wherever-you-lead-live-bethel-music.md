I’m done trusting in what’s sinking
These boats weren’t built for me
I’m done drifting on the water
Of insecurity
In the noise and the distractions
In the storms of arguing
I hear Your voice calling
I’m gonna fix my eyes on Jesus
Walking with the One who walks on the sea
Oh, I’m gonna give my life to follow
Speak to me and I’ll go
Wherever You lead
Wherever You lead
I’m done worshiping an image
Of what only looks like me
Surrounding You with limits
Of what my eyes can see
God would You forgive mе
Restore the mystеry
I hear Your voice calling, calling
