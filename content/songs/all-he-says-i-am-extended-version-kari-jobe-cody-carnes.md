He whispers in my ear, tells me that I'm fearless
He shares a melody, tells me to repeat it
And it makes me whole, it reminds my soul
[Chorus: Cody Carnes]
I am all He says I am
I am all He says I am
I am all He says I am
And He says I am His own
I was blinded by scales upon my eyes
And He came like a light and burned up all the lies
Oh He set me free, He reminded me
[Chorus: Cody Carnes & Kari Jobe]
I am all He says I am
I am all He says I am
I am all He says I am
And He says I am His own
[Bridge 1: Cody Carnes & 
Kari Jobe
]
Chains are broken, and scales are on the floor
Truth is spoken, I'm no orphan anymore
Chains are broken, and scales are on the floor
Truth is spoken, I'm no orphan anymore
Chains are broken, and scales are on the floor
Truth is spoken, I'm no orphan anymore
No orphan anymore
