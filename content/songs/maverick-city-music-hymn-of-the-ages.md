Faithful You have been, Jesus
Precious Lord Jesus
Treasure of mine
Oh, what a privilege
To be Your delight
Morning by morning
New glories I see
Oh, what a wonder
You are to me
And all of the promises, all of the praise
All of Your people have sung through the ages
No matter the season, the song is the same
Great is Your faithfulness, great is Your name
Great is Your faithfulness, great is Your name
Great is Your name
God of our fathers
You're the God of our peace
God, the Redeemer
Of all history
High King of Heaven
My victory won
Still be my vision
Still be my song
And all of the promises, all of the praise
All of Your people have sung through the ages
No matter the season, the song is the same
Great is Your faithfulness, great is Your name
And all of the promises, all of the praises
All of Your people have sung through the ages
No matter the season, the song is the same
Great is Your faithfulness, great is Your name
Great is Your faithfulness, great is Your name
Great is Your name, Jesus
Oh, it's the sweetest name I've ever known
There's none like it, none like it
Every question is answered in the living name of Jesus
All my healing is answered in the name of Jesus
All deliverance in the name of Jesus
It's all in that name, that name
And blessed assurance
And oh, what a grace
Oh, I'm prone to wander
But You're prone to chase
This is my story
It's the song that I'll raise
I'll sing of Your goodness
Oh, all of my days
All of the promises, all of the praise (All of)
All of Your people have sung through the ages (All of Your people)
No matter the season, the song is the same (No matter the season)
Great is Your faithfulness, great is Your name (And all of Your promises)
All of the promises, all of the praise (All of the people)
All of Your people have sung through the ages (No matter the season)
No matter the season, the song is the same
Great is Your faithfulness, great is Your name
And great is Your faithfulness, great is Your name
Oh great is Your faithfulness, great is Your name
Great is Your faithfulness, great is Your name
Your name, Your name is great
How great Thou art
How great Thou art (How great You are)
(Then sings my soul, God) Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee (How great You are, Jesus
Oh, just to behold Your goodness)
How great Thou art (Oh)
How great Thou art
(Then sings my soul) Then sings my soul
My Savior God, to Thee (Oh You are worthy of all of the glory)
How great Thou art (You are worthy of all the praise)
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul
My Savior God to Thee (How great You are, holy, holy, holy)
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
