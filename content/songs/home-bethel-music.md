[Instrumental]
My eyes have now been fixed
My heart has now been set on love
I've turned my gaze to this
The One whom which my soul cries out for
[Instrumental]
There is none I've known
That holds my heart as You do now
I've made for You a home
A place where love can grow and be found
Draw to me Jesus
I've made my heart a home
My love is Jesus
My love is You alone
Draw to me Jesus
I've made my heart a home
My love is Jesus
My love is You alone
