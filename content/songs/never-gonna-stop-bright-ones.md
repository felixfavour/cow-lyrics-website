[Intro]
Oooh-ah, oh-oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Oooh-ah, oh-oh-ooh
Each thread inside my tapestry
Was made by You and meant for me
You wove me with Your hands
You create, You orchestrate
If life's a picture, You're the frame
You are God, You're the great I Am
[Pre-Chorus]
You go in the wild with me
You are the lantern for each step I take
Yeah, and I know I don't have to be afraid
You never let go
'Cause You love me so relentlessly
Never gonna stop coming after my heart
Never ever gonna stop coming after my hear'-hear'-heart, hear'-heart
Never gonna stop coming after my heart
Never ever gonna stop coming after my hear'-hear'-heart, hear'-heart, yeah
[Refrain]
Never gonna, stop, stop
Never gonna, never stop, coming my heart
Never gonna, stop, stop
Never gonna, never stop, coming my heart
Never gonna, stop, stop
Never gonna, never stop, coming my heart
Never gonna, stop, stop
Never gonna, never stop, coming my heart
Oooh-ah, oh-oh-ooh, oh-ooh
