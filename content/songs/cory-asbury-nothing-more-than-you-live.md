I need words, deeper than the ocean
And I need a voice that's bigger than the sky
And I need a song that's worthy of Your nail scars
To sing of the love that took a chance on me
'Cause this is more than I could ask for and more than I could dream
The One who made the world somehow thinks the world of me
The highest King of Heaven chose to love a fool
I don't understand it but I know I want nothing more than You
And I thought God was further than horizons
And I thought grace was just beyond my reach
But You said my life was worthy of Your nail scars
So I'll sing like it was 'cause You took a chance on me
Now this is more than I could ask for, more than I could dream
The One who made the world somehow thinks the world of me
The highest King of Heaven chose to love a fool
I don't understand it but I know I want nothing more than You
Nothing more than You
When I was at my lowest, You still were on Your throne
And when I was still a long way off, You ran to bring me home
When I was prone to wander, You loved me anyway
When I was six feet under, You pulled me from the grave, yeah
Now this is more than I could ask for and more than I could dream
The One who made the world somehow thinks the world of me
The highest King of Heaven chose to love a fool
I don't understand it, but I know I want nothing more than You
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
I want nothing more than You
