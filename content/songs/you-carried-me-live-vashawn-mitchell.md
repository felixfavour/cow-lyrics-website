I climbed up to the highest mountain
I looked all around, couldn't find nobody
Way down into the deepest valley
Looked all around down there, couldn't find nobody
I went across the deep blue sea
Couldn't find one to compare to your grace your love your mercy
Nobody greater nobody greater than you
Searched all over couldn't find nobody
I looked high and low still couldn't find nobody
Nobody greater, nobody greater no, no nobody greater than you
Searched all over couldn't find nobody
I looked high and low still couldn't find nobody
Nobody greater, nobody greater, no nobody greater than you
Nobody can heal like you can
Oh most holy one you are the great I am
Awesome in all your ways and mighty is your hand
You are He who carried out redemption's plan
You are He who carried out redemption's plan
Searched all over couldn't find nobody
I looked high and low still couldn't find nobody
Nobody greater, nobody greater Jesus, nobody greater than you
(Searched all over) Searched all over couldn't find nobody
I looked high and low still couldn't find nobody
Nobody greater, 'body greater, no nobody greater than yo
Nobody greater, nobody greater Jesus, nobody greater than you
(Nobody greater) Nobody greater, nobody greater no, nobody greater than you
(Nobody greater) Nobody greater, (couldn't find nobody) nobody greater (nobody greater than you), nobody greater than you
(Nobody greater) Nobody greater, nobody greater, nobody greater than you
Nobody greater than you eh
Nobody greater (no), nobody greater ('body greater), nobody greater than you
(Nobody greater) Nobody greater, nobody greater, nobody greater than you
Nobody greater, nobody greater, (nobody greater) nobody greater than you
(Nobody greater) Nobody greater, nobody greater (nobody greater), nobody greater than you
