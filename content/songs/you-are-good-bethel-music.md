I want to scream it out
From every mountaintop
Your goodness knows no bounds
Your goodness never stops
Your mercy follows me
Your kindness fills my life
Your love amazes me
And I'll sing because You are good
And I'll dance because You are good
And I'll shout because You are good
You are good, good to me
Nothing and no one comes
Anywhere close to You
The earth and oceans deep
Only reflect this truth
And in my darkest night
You shine as bright as day
Your love amazes me
