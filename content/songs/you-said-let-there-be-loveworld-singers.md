You said, “let there be”
And the world became

None can comprehend
The greatness of Your strength

Your wisdom, Lord, is beyond compare
Everything You made
Shows how beautiful You are

The universe responds at Your command
You’re the great and mighty God

Your sovereignty, Lord, is incontestable
You’re the great and mighty God


We proclaim Your name
In every era, oh Lord
You are the same
You’re righteous, Lord

As Your treasure, oh Lord
We sing Your praise
All-powerful God

With power and beauty, oh Lord
Your glory unfolds
You’re the Prince of peace
The bright, morning star

From galaxies vast to the tiniest seed
Your handiwork shows how great You are

Lord Jesus, Creator of all things
Awesome are Your works
My Lord and King

The universe responds at Your command
You’re the great and mighty God

Your sovereignty, Lord, is incontestable
You’re the great and mighty God

We proclaim Your name
In every era, oh Lord
You are the same
You’re righteous, Lord

As Your treasure, oh Lord
We sing Your praise
All-powerful God

With power and beauty, oh Lord
Your glory unfolds
You’re the Prince of peace
The bright, morning star

Hallelu-u-u-jah
Hallelu-u-u-jah

We proclaim Your name
In every era, oh Lord
You are the same
You’re righteous, Lord

As Your treasure, oh Lord
We sing Your praise
All-powerful God

With power and beauty, oh Lord
Your glory unfolds
You’re the Prince of peace
The bright, morning star
