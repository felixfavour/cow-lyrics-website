You hide, and I want to find You
Go, and I will follow You
'Cause I want to be where You are
As You move, I’m right beside You, love
Oh, I’m running after You
'Cause I want to be where You are
And I’m chasing You, I’m so in love
Captivated, I just can’t get enough
I’ll spend my days running after Your heart
Your heart, Your heart, whoa
I’m chasing You with all my love
Captivated, I just can't get enough
I’ll spend my days running after Your heart
Your heart, Your heart, whoa
Heart, You’ve won me heart and soul
And where You lead I’ll go
I want to be where You are
From the moment I rise to the moment I sleep
My affection is for You, and even as I dream
I want to know You, I’m after Your heart
