In the quiet
in the stillness I know that you are God
in the secret of your presence, I know that I am restored
when you call, I won't refuse
His new day again I'll choose
there is no one else for me, none but Jesus, crusified to set me free, now I live to bring him praise.
In the chaos
in confusion I know ?
in the moment of my weakness you give me grace to do your will
So when you call I won't delay
?
There is no one else for me
none but Jesus
crusified to set me free, now I live to bring him praise
There is no one else for me
none but Jesus (crusified)
crusified to set me free, now I live to bring him praise
all my delight is in you
all of my hope
all of my strength
all my delight is in you
forever more (2)
There is no one else for me
none but Jesus
crusified to set me free, now I live to bring him praise.
