(Verse 1)
Whenever I call him, he's right on time
Whenever I need him, he's by my side
So I don't worr y, God is in control
And I know he's able, to see me through
I know he's able, to see me through
(Verse 2)
When life's situations, are stressing you
You don't know just, what to do
Keep on praying, cause God is in control
And he is able, to see you through
I know he's able, to see you through
(Chorus)
He's able, to see you through
When problems, are surrounding you
Remember, God is in control
And he is able, to see you through
God is able, to see you through
(Drive)
No matter, what you're going through
Just trust him, he'll be there for you
He promised, and his word is true
He's able, to ess you through
He's able
He's able
He's able
To see you through
