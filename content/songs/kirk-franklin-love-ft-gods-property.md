Paitent love, sweet love, kind love
Paitent love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Paitent love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Paitent love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Love a word that comes and goes
But few people really know what it means to really love somebody
Love though the tears may fade away
I'm so glad your love will stay
'Cause I love you and you show me
Jesus what it really means to love
Patient love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Patient love, kind love, sweet love, kind love
Love a word that comes and goes
But few people really know what it means to really love somebody
Love though the tears may fade away
I'm so glad your love will stay
'Cause I love you and you show me
Jesus what it really means to love
The nights that I cried you loved me
When I should have died you loved me
I'll never know why you love me
Its a mystery to me now I'm glad to see Jesus
When all hope was gone you loved me
You gave me a song that you loved me
Now I can go on 'cause you love me
Its a mystery to me now I'm glad to see Jesus
The nights that I cried you loved me
When I should have died you loved me
I'll never know why you love me
Its a mystery to me now I'm glad to see Jesus
When all hope was gone you loved me
You gave me a song that you loved me
Now I can go on 'cause you love me
Its a mystery to me now I'm glad to see Jesus
What it really means
What it really means
What it really means
