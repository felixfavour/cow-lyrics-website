[Bridge: Fleurie]
He is born, He is born
The Son of God has come to dwell
The King of kings and Lord of lords
Emmanuel
He is born, He is born
Hope for all, now go and tell
He has come to save the world
We sing Noel
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin & Fleurie]
And I'll fall face down, as Your glory shines around
Yes, I'll fall face down, as Your glory shines around
And I'll fall face down, as Your glory shines around
Yes, I'll fall face down, as Your glory shines around
