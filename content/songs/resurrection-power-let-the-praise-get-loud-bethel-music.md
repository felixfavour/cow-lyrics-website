[Chorus]
There is resurrection power
When we sing the name of Jesus
Resurrection power when we raise a mighty sound
So come on let the praise get loud
Make that empty grave resound
'Cause there is resurrection power in His name
There's a sling in my voice
And a stone in my praise
Pushing back when the darkest weapons form
There's a power on my lips
Even Death can't defy
When the name of our God is lifted high
There is resurrection power
When we sing the name of Jesus
Resurrection power when we raise a mighty sound
So come on let the praise get loud
Make that empty grave resound
'Cause there is resurrection power in His name
There are days I have seen
Filled with heartache and loss
That have buried my heart beneath the weight
