What reason do I have to wake up with the rising sun
And not be held down by the weight of all the things I've done
What reason do I have to feel this hope instead of hurt
How can it be I don't receive the judgement I deserve
Wave upon wave of grace upon grace
Endlessly washing my sins away
I know the only reason I can stand here free of all my shame
Is wave upon wave of grace upon grace upon grace
How can you see me at my worst and still say I am loved
What promise can I stand on when I don't feel good enough When the enemy is reminding me of all I've done wrong
What freedom do I have to sing this new creation song
Wave upon wave of grace upon grace
Endlessly washing my sins away
I know the only reason I can stand here free of all my shame
Is wave upon wave of grace upon grace upon grace
Singing
What can wash away my sin and make me new again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me white as snow, no other fount'n i know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Wave upon wave of grace upon grace
Endlessly washing my sins away
I know the only reason I can stand here free of all my shame
Is wave upon wave of grace upon grace
Wave upon wave of grace upon grace upon grace
What can wash away my sin and make me new again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
