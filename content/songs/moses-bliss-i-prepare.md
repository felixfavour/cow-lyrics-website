Moses Bliss_I Prepare Lyrics.
 (I Prepare) I Prepare my Heart
For the Life that is to Come
I Prepare my Heart
For the Joy of Meeting Jesus
I Prepare my Heart
For the Coming Endless Life
I Prepare my Heart
To Hear Well-done Faithful Servant

I Prepare, I Prepare
For the Coming of Jesus
I Prepare, I Prepare
For the Coming of the Lord
No Room for Distractions
(Aah aah aah)
No Room for the Flesh
(Aah aah aah)
Daily I Sow to the Spirit
(Aah aah aah)
Cause my Life is from Above
My Head is on the Plough
I'm never Looking Back
I'm Climbing up this Mountain
And the Lord is Waiting for Me
Let no Man Bother me
Cause I am Marked
With the Mark of Christ O
I am going to See the Lord

I Prepare, I Prepare
For the Coming of Jesus
(I Lay aside every Weight)
I Prepare, I Prepare
For the Coming of the Lord
(My Eyes is Fixed on Jesus,
Everything is for the Kingdom)
I Prepare, I Prepare
For the Coming of Jesus
(I'll Tell the whole World
and Everybody He is Coming)
I Prepare, I Prepare
For the Coming of the Lord
[Bridge]
Gold has no Value
Wealth has no Meaning
As I Contemplate your Glory
Nothing Else Matters
Nothing Else Counts Now
As I Wait to See your Face
Gold has no Value
Wealth has no Meaning
As I Contemplate your Glory
Nothing Else Matters
Nothing Else Counts Now
As I Wait to See your Face

I Prepare my Heart
For the Life that is to Come
I Prepare my Heart
For the Joy of Meeting Jesus
I Prepare my Heart
For the Coming Endless Life
I Prepare my Heart
To Hear Well-done
Faithful Servant
Be Prepared to Meet your Maker
