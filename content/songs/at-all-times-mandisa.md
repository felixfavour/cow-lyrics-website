At all times
All times
I will bless the Lord
At all times
At all times
All times
I will bless the Lord
At all times
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Strong and courageous (Strong and courageous)
Mighty in battle (Mighty in battle)
He's fighting for us (He's fighting for us)
The victory is ours (The victory is ours)
Put on Your armor (Put on Your armor)
The sword of the spirit (The sword of the spirit)
Our weapon is worship (Our weapon is worship)
The victory is ours (The victory is ours)
Shout out to Jesus (Shout it out)
At all times
All times
I will bless the Lord
At all times
At all times
All times
I will bless the Lord
At all times
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
