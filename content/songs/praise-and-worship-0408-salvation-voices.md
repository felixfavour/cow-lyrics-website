Jesus Jesus Jesus 
There is something about your name
Master Saviour Jesus 
Like a fragrance after the rain

Kings and kingdoms 
Shall all pass away 
But there is something about your name 

Jesus - Jesus 
Jesus - Jesus 
How I love 
Calling your name

Jesus - Jesus 
Jesus - Jesus 
Everyday 
Your name is the same 

How I love calling your name 
everyday your name is the same

I will declare You are the only God
The only God, The only God
I will declare You are the only God
The only God I know

Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;
to his feet your tribute bring.
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
evermore his praises sing.

Alleluia, alleluia!
Praise the everlasting King

Praise him for his grace and favor
to his people in distress.
Praise him, still the same as ever,
slow to chide, and swift to bless.

Alleluia, alleluia!
Glorious in his faithfulness!

All hail the power of Jesus' name!
Let angels prostrate fall.
Bring forth the royal diadem,
and crown him Lord of all.

Bring forth the royal diadem,
and crown him Lord of all.

Let every tongue and every tribe
responsive to his call,
to him all majesty ascribe,
and crown him Lord of all.

To him all majesty ascribe,
and crown him Lord of all

The King is coming
In Glory and in Majesty (every eye will see)
Every eye will see the King

I say the King is coming, coming
In Glory and in Majesty (every eye will see)
Every eye will see the King, hey

The tomb is empty
He died for me and rose again
Every eye will see the King

I say His tomb is empty
He died for me and rose again
Every eye will see the King

Behold He comes, riding on the clouds 
Shining like the sun 
At the trumpet call 

Lift your voice 
Its the year of jubilee 
out of Zions hill 
Salvation comes

There's no God like Jehovah 
There's no God like Jehovah 
There's no God like Jehovah

There's no God like Jehovah 
There's no God like Jehovah 
There's no God like Jehovah 
There's no God like Jehovah
