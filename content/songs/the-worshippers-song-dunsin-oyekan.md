Thank you for the things You do
For the miracles You give
But I still, prefer Your presence, over everything
I still choose being with You, over these things
Thank you for the things You do
For the miracles You give
But I still, prefer Your presence, over everything
I still choose being with You, over these things
Just like Mary
I’ll stay right here at Your feet
There are pleasures
Joy unspеakable with You
I still prefer Your prеsence, over everything
I still choose being with You, over these things
(Thank you for the things)
Thank you for the things You do
For the miracles You give
But I still, prefer Your presence, over everything
I still choose being with You, over these things
