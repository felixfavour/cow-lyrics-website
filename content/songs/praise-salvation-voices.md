Aka Aka Ya (The arm of the Lord)
Aka Jehovah na’eme mma (The arm of the Lord does great things)
Olu ebube ya (The display of His splendor)
Nke na eruari na’ebem no (I see all around me)

Isi iyi nke ndu (The stream of life)
Nke na dighi ata’ta (That never runs dry)
Aka aka ya (The arm of the Lord)
Aka Jehovah na’eme mma (The arm of His strength does great things)

The Lord our God is King of Israel
The Lord our God is Mighty

He's full of Grace and Mercy
He's given us His Son Emmanuel
Atonement for all of our sins
A gift to set us all free

… Oh let there be praise let the Lord be praised
Let there be praise let the Lord be praised
With all of my heart I will I will lift up my voice
And to You I will sing
