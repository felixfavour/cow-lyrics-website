You're in the heat of it all
You're in the fire to get me
You're in the wild You're in the deep
You're in the thick
You are in the thin
You know just how to elate me
Could I ever say that I'm empty
When your desire it fills me
Can I say that I'm uneven
Can I say that I'm undriven
When your passion; it fuels me
Oh what a wonder it is
To be loved an unworthy
You show me love isn't burden
You show me love isn't weak
I wanna fall on my knees
I wanna lay here in trembling
Could I ever imagine my life without you
For me you'd risk it all
Climb the hills
Go down valleys
Scale every course and the high seas
You'll cross 'em for me
Could I ever say that I'm lost
You're always there You're to guide me
You're never far You're beside me
Now and forever and always
Oh what a wonder it is
To be loved an unworthy
You show me love isn't burden
You show me love isn't weak
I wanna fall on my knees
And I wanna lay here in trembling
Could I ever imagine my life without you
How could I ever imagine
Could I ever imagine
I wanna fall on my knees
And I wanna lay here in trembling
Could I ever imagine my life without you?
No
