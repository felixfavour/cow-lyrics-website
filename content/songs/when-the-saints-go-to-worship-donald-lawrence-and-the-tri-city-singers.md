When the saints
Go to worship
That's when the king
Of kings
Shall come in
When the saints
Go up
In praise
That's when the spirit
Shall inhabit
This place
When the saints
Get on one accord
And begin to
Bless
The Lord
Then the king
Who is strong and mighty
Oh, the king
Who is mighty in battle
Yea, the king
Of glory shall come in
When the saints
Go to worship
That's when deliverance
Will take place
When the saints
Go up
In praise
All of Satan's powers
Are erased
Every trap
The enemy set
Can't work
Won't work
Then the king
Who is strong and mighty
Oh, the king
Who is mighty in battle
Yea, the king
Of glory shall come in
We welcome you in
We welcome you in
You're the king
And you're
Invited to
Come in
To this sanctuary
This tabernacle
You're the king
And you're
Invited to
Come in
We welcome you in
(You are welcome)
We welcome you in
(You are welcome)
You're the king
And you're
Invited to
Come in
To this sanctuary
(This sanctuary)
This tabernacle
(This tabernacle.)
You're the king
And you're
Invited to
Come in
