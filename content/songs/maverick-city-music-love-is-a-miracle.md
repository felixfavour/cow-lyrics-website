I was down in the valley
Before Love came and grabbed me
Never thought I'd see the sun again
Without no hesitation
You became my Resurrection
All the light that came shining in
And I've got beauty for ashes
And I've got joy for mourning
And I've got praise for heaviness
Love is a miracle
And I've got beauty for ashes
And I've got joy for mourning
And I've got praise for heaviness
Love is a miracle
This is more than religion
Glad I made my decisions
Hope reversed the curse I was walking in
Now I'm dancing on my breakthroughs
Where you lead me I will follow
You gave a light that the darkness can't comprehend
And I've got beauty for ashes
And I've got joy for mourning
And I've got praise for heaviness
Love is a miracle
I got beauty for ashes
And I've got joy for mourning
And I've got praise for heaviness
Love is a miracle
I remember the voice that called me
I remember when my heart said yes
I will never forget the morning
You were singing all for me
Yeah eh eh eh yeah eeh eh eh
And I've got beauty for ashes
And I've got joy for mourning
And I've got praise for heaviness
Love is a miracle
And I've got beauty for ashes
And I've got joy for mourning
And I've got praise for heaviness
Love is a miracle
Now I've got mercies in the morning
And I've got rivers ever flowing
And I've got freedom and I'm dancing
Love is a miracle
Yeah eh eh eh yeah eeh eh eh
...
When the world say no, You say yes
You say yes
