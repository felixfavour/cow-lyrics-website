Oh search me, Lord
Come on and search me, Lord
Here's what I want You to do... shine the light... from heaven... on my soul
If You find anything that shouldn't be
Take it out and strengthen me
'Cause I wanna be right
I wanna be saved
And I wanna be whole
Oooh... search me, Lord
Search me, Lord
Shine Your light from heaven on my soul
If You find anything that shouldn't be
Take it out Lord, and strengthen me
'Cause I wanna be right
I wanna be saved
I wanna be whole
While I'm down here praying
Lord, search my heart
While I'm down here praying
Lord, search my heart
While I'm down here praying
Lord, search my heart
Because You know whether I'm right or wrong  (You know if I'm right or wrong)
Search me, Lord now
Come on and search me, Lord
Here's what I want You to do... shine the light... from heaven... on my soul
And if You find anything that shouldn't be
Why don't You take it out and strengthen me
'Cause I wanna be right
Wanna be saved
Wanna be right every day, every way (Everyday I wanna be right... I wanna be saved... I wanna be whole)
I'm calling on You, Jesus (You're the one that can save me, Jesus)
I don't wanna live this way
Want You to make me over again, in my mind...
My heart...
My soul...
Yes God, every part
The way that I walk...
And I talk...
The way I live and the way I give
You know...
My thoughts...
You know...
Secret of every fault (Every part of me)
Good God...
You gonna make me clean
Make me whole deep down within
I just wanna be right  (Wanna be right)
I just wanna be right  (Make me right)
I just wanna be right (Wanna be right, Lord make me right)
Everyday that I'm living  (Wanna be right)
I just wanna be right  (Make me right)
Everything that I'm trying to do  (Wanna be right)
I just wanna be right  (Make me right)
I want You to wash me  (I Wanna be right)
In Your blood  (Make me right)
Take away  (I Wanna be right)
Every blot and stain  (Make me right)
My iniquities  (I Wanna be right)
Make them whiter  (Make me right)
Whiter than snow right now  (I Wanna be right)
I pray  (Aaah... make me right)
Getting down on my knees  (Make me right)
And I'm crying  (I Wanna be right)
From down my heart  (Lord, Make me right)
Good God  (I Wanna be right)
I don't wanna live this way  (Make me right)
So help me  (I Wanna be right)
Help me out today  (Make me right, Oooh... I wanna be right)
Jesus  (I Wanna be right)
I need You  (Oh, Make me right)
Come on  (I Wanna be right)
Take control of my life (Make me right)
Please  (I Wanna be right)
Take away my sin  (Oh, Make me right)
Oh yeah  (I Wanna be right)
Only You can do it, Lord  (Make me right)
I trust You (I Wanna be right)
With my whole heart  (Make me right)
