[Spoken]
Across the desert
Wrapped in scarves
One is brighter
In a chandelier of stars
Tired and lonely
Over miles of mountains and sand
The prophets tell of a Baby
He's born to save
Like graffiti on our hearts
The world will know His name
Heaven like a highway exit sign
Points to Bethlehem
[Sung]
Star of wonder
Star of night
Star with royal
Beauty, bright
Westward leading
Still proceeding
Guide us to Your
Perfect Light
[Spoken]
When they saw the Child
They dropped to their knees
Thе answer to a million prayers
In a Newborn hеartbeat
And the words He would say
Would be written in red
And the gifts they've carried
They lay at His feet
In the eyes of Mary
A tear runs down her cheek
Jesus, the Messiah
In a lowly manger bed
