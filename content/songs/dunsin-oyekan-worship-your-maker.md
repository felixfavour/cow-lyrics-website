More than Words can Say
More than my Mind can Grasp
There's a Place where Words
And my Reasoning can't Go
It's the Presence of the very One Himself
So I'll loose my Spirit
To Express my Worship
More than Words can Say
More than my Mind can Grasp
There's a Place where Words
And my Reasoning can't Go
It's the Presence of the very One Himself
So I'll loose my Spirit
To Express my Worship
More than Words can Say
More than my Mind can Grasp
There's a Place where Words
And my Reasoning can't Go
It's the Presence of the very One Himself
So I'll loose my Spirit
To Express my Worship
