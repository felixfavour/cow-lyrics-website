God is fighting for us, God is on our side
He has overcome, yes, He has overcome
We will not be shaken, we will not be moved
Jesus, You are here
Ooh
[Instrumental]
God is fighting for us, God is on our side
He has overcome, yes, He has overcome
We will not be shaken, we will not be moved
Jesus, You are here
Carrying our burdens, covering our shame
He has overcome, yes, He has overcome
We will not be shaken, we will not be moved
Jesus, You are here
I will live, I will not die
The resurrection power of Christ
Alive in me and I am free
In Jesus' Name
