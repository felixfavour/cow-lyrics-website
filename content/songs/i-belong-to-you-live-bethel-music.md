Your love has won my heart forever
Not because of anything I've done
But You have scaled the hills and mountains
Just to search and find the one You love
'Cause I belong to You
I belong to You
I belong to You
Forever Yours
And when I was drowning in my doubt
Your mighty right hand lifted me out
And now we are walking on the water
'Cause You lift my head above the crowd
'Cause I belong to You
I belong to You
I belong to You
Forever Yours
'Cause I belong to You
I belong to You
I belong to You
Forever Yours
