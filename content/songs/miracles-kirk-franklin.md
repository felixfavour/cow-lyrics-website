[Intro]
Come on!
Hit me!
One more time
I've seen God do miracles today
I mean things that I can't explain
Like flooding me with grace
Standing before me
Blessing every step I take
I've seen God do miracles to me
Things that don't change easily
It was hard but you were patiently preparing me
I know there are some who doubt it
Life won't let them think about it
But us, we cannot live without it
He's everything I need
I've seen God do miracles
Incredible
I've seen God do miracles today
They come in so many ways
Like the sunlight on my face or the debt of sin
I could not pay that's been erased
I know there are some who doubt it
Life don't let them think about it
But us, we cannot live without it
He's everything I need
