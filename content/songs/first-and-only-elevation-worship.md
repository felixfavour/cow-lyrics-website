Draw me again, into the center of Your love
Where I began, I know that You are still enough
Lord You restore, all the desires of my heart
Just like before, when I discovered who You are
I need You more
I need You more than ever
I need You more
Jesus, I need You more
I will abide, be still and know that You are God
For You are mine, and in Your presence I'm alive
Here in this place, within Your shadow I am safe
Every mistake, fading into the light of grace
I need You more
I need You more than ever
I need You more
Jesus, I need You more
I need You more
I need You more than ever
I need You more
Jesus, I need You more
