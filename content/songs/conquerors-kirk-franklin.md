Tomorrow is a brand new day
All my sins have been washed away
My hands are new, my life is free
My heart is pure, I've been redeemed
See I've seen his face, touched his hand
Finally, now I understand
Why He saved a wretch, a wretch like me
And by His blood I've been redeemed
[Pre-Hook]
We ran the race, we kept the fight
We shed our blood for what was right
We carried our cross through storm and rain
Because of Christ now we can say
[Hook]
We are conquerors, conquerors
We are conquerors, conquerors
See I've seen his face, touched his hand
Finally, now I understand
Why He saved a wretch, a wretch like me
And by His blood I've been redeemed
