[Instrumental]
We are an altar of broken stones
But You delight in the offering
You have the heavens to call Your home
But You abide in the song we sing
Ten thousand angels surround Your throne
To bring You praise that will never cease
But hallelujah from here below
Is still Your favorite melody
We sing
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
We sing
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
And should the fire that once burned bright
Become an ember my eyes can't see
I will remember Your sacrifice
I will abide in Your love for me
