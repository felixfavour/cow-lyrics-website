This is a good day to praise the Lord
We're gonna praise Him with all of our hearts
This is a good day to praise the Lord
We're gonna praise Him with all of our hearts
This is a good day to praise the Lord
We're gonna praise Him with all of our hearts
This is a good day to praise the Lord
We're gonna praise Him with all of our hearts
With our heart and soul, mind and spirit
We're gonna lift up the precious
We're gonna lift up the matchless
We're gonna lift up the wondrous name of our Lord
With our heart and soul, mind and spirit
We're gonna lift up the precious
We're gonna lift up the matchless
We're gonna lift up the wondrous name of our Lord
No other name can usher peace and joy like Jesus' name
No other name can offer hope and love like Jesus' name
So we dedicate this day to the One who sanctifies our praise
Yes, we lift up the glorious name of our Lord
This is a good day to praise the Lord
We're gonna praise Him with all of our hearts
This is a good day to praise the Lord
We're gonna praise Him with all of our hearts
This is a good day to praise the Lord
We're gonna praise Him with all of our hearts
This is a good day to praise the Lord
We're gonna praise Him with all of our hearts
