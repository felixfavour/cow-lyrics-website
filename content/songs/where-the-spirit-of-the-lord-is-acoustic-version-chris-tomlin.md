We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is liberty
We know living in your freedom
Living in your freedom, we see your glory
We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is liberty
We're yours, yours is the kingdom
We're yours, yours is the kingdom, whew
You are the fire through the night
You are the flame that burns inside
We need your presence more than anything
More than just a song to sing
More than words and offerings
We need your presence more than anything
And You're all that we want
You're all that we need
You're all that we want
You're all that we need
We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is liberty
We know living in your freedom
Living in your freedom, we see your glory
We know where the Spirit of the Lord is
Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is liberty
