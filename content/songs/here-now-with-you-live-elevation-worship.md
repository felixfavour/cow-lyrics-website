[Intro]
Time goes faster as years go by
All that matters is You and I
Are here now
Time goes faster as years go by
All that matters is You and I
Are here now
I'm here now
With You, ooh-ooh, You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Every dead-end road, every dream I chased
Not a single mile ever went to waste
'Cause I'm here now
I'm here now
I was in my head, I was somewhere else
And I missеd so much, thought I lost myself
But I'm here now
I'm hеre now
With You, ooh-ooh, You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, You, ooh-ooh
You, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
