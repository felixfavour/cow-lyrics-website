There's about to be
A suddenly in this place
I, I hear a sound
A mighty sound
The rising of faith
There's about to be
A suddenly in this place
I, I hear a sound
A mighty sound
The rising of faith
There's about to be
A suddenly in this place
I, I hear a sound
A mighty sound
The rising of faith
Even now You are moving
Even now You are moving
Even now You are moving
Even now You are moving
There's about to be
A miracle in this place
Your promise to me
I'm gonna see
Yes, I believe
