I see the King of glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes, yeah
I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing
The people sing
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith
I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees
