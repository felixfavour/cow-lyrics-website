Lord, we worship You
We lift our voice to You
For You are our King
Our triumphant King

Power and victory
Shall always be with me
For you are mighty (yeah!)
Mighty in battle (yeah!)

There's no one greater than you!

Lord You are our champion
There's not one battle you haven't won
You will always be victorious forever

Lord You are our champion
Won't be defeated, it can't been done
In every battle, in every war
You are the victor!

You reign
You reign in victory
I am so glad
That you fight for me
