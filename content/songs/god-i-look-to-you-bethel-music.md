God I look to You, I wont be overwhelmed
Give me vision to see things like You do
God I look to You, You're where my help comes from
Give me wisdom, You know just what to do

And I will love You Lord my strength
And I will love You Lord my shield
And I will love You Lord my rock
Forever all my days I will love You God

Hallelujah our God reigns
Hallelujah our God reigns
Oh hallelujah our God you reigns
Forever all my days Hallelujah

Hallelujah our God reigns
And hallelujah our God reigns
Oh hallelujah our God you reigns
Forever all my days Hallelujah

And hallelujah our God reigns
Hallelujah our God reigns
And Hallelujah our God reigns
Forever all my days Hallelujah
