I thank You for it all
The good, bad, the ugly, great and small
The times of victory, and when I fall
I'm so grateful that I'm still standing tall
I thank You for my tears
The pain helped me overcome my fears
You've been good to me down throughout the years
It's a miracle that I'm still standing here
All that I am is because of all that You brought me through
And everything I survived, it's all because of You
I thank You for it all
The good, bad, the ugly, great and small
The times of victory and when I fall (oh my)
I'm so grateful that I'm still standing tall (I thank You for my tears)
I thank You for the tears (the pain helped me)
The pain helped me overcome my fears
You've been good to me down throughout the years (yes You have)
It's a miracle I'm still standing here
All that I am is because of all that You've brought me through
And everything I survived, it's all because of You
How can say thank You for all the ways you made for me (I can't thank You enough)
The doors You opened
The times You were there always making a way for me (I can't thank You enough)
I cannot express the gratitude that I feel for You right now (I can't thank You enough)
So, I just have to pause for a moment right now and say
I gotta say thank You (thank You)
For all You've done for me (for all that You've done for me)
Oh thank You (thank You)
For every opportunity (for every opportunity)
I gotta say thank You (thank You)
I gotta tell You thank You for all the ways You made (You've always made a way)
Oh-ooh (thank You)
I just wanna say, I just wanna say (I just wanna say)
Thank You (thank You)
For my life (for my life)
Thank You (thank You)
Thank You (for my health)
Thank You (thank You)
Thank You (thank You)
Ooh
I thank You for it all
The good, bad, the ugly, great and small
The times of victory and when I fall
I'm so grateful that I'm still standing tall
All that I am is because of all that You've brought me through
Everything I survived is all because of You
I'm grateful for You
