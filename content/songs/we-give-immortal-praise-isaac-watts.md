1. We give immortal praise
To God the father's love
for all our comforts here
and better hopes above
he sent his own eternal son
to die for sins that man had done
2. To God the son belongs
immortal glory too,
who brought us with his blood
from everlasting woe;
and now he lives, and now he reigns
and sees the fruit of all is pains
3. To God the spirits name
immortal worship give,
whose new-creating power
makes the dead sinner live
His work completes the great design
and fills the soul with joy divine
4. Almighty God, to thee 
be endless honors
The undivided three
And the mysterious one
where reason fails, with all her powers
There faith prevails and love adores
