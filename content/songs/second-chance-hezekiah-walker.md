Lord I need to feel the touch of Your hand
Your will for my life I want to understand
Lord forgive me like only You can
For your the God of a second chance
Lord I'm tired of the way that I am
In Your love I want to live and stand
To adhere to Your every command
For You're the God of a second chance
For You're the God of a second chance
Show me
All of my wrongs
Forgive me
And make strong
Oh Save me
Restore my song
For You're the God of a second chance
You gave me
A second chance
You forgave me like only You can
You gave me
A second chance
