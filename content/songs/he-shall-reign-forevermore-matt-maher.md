In the bleak midwinter, all creation grown
For a world in darkness, frozen like a stone
Light is breaking, in a statement for the throne
If I were a wise man, I would travel far
If I were a shepherd, I would do my part
For as I am, I will give to Him my heart
[Refrain]
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
Unto us a child is born
The king of kings, the lord of lords
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
Here within the manger lies
The one who builds the starry skies
This baby born for sacrifice
Christ, our Messiah
To our hopes and to our fears
The Savior of the world appears
The promise of eternal years
Christ, our Messiah
