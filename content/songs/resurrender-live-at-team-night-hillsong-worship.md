You're turning over tables and calling for return
To our lives upon the altar, the things we did at first
You’re clearing out the temple, You're cleaning out the dirt
For we are Your territory, Lord, we are Your Church
(Come on)
And we are Your people, You are our God
We are Your temple, make us holy like You are
Make us holy like You are
You see a holy nation, a flock to consecrate
A chosen generation, a pеople called to pray
So help us, God to plеase You, where only You can see
For every moment matters in eternity
(We are)
We are Your people and You are our God
We are Your temple, make us holy like You are
We are Your children, You've set us apart
God, for Your glory, make us holy like You are
[Interlude]
Make us holy like You are, that’s our prayer, Lord
Holy like You are, holy like You are, ooh
Can we sing?
