Our Father wey dey for heaven
Nobody fit collect the chair
Wey You sit down
Okay
Brother Nwachukwu (eh le le)
Abeg oh, don't be sleeping on a bicycle
Let's go!
Our Father wey dey for heaven
Nobody fit collect the chair
Wey You sit down (eh-eh)
Our Papa
We gbadun Your pattern
And we throway salama
'Cause na You hold us down
These other gods
Wey them dey carry for pocket
I cannot relate
'Cause my Father is not their mate oh
These other gods wey them dey keep for apartment
All of them are worthless
And I just dey laugh
'Cause my Father is bigger than (odo)
Every (odo)
Any (odogwu)
Oh-o-o-oh (odo)
Any (odo)
All the (odogwu)
Because my Father is bigger than (odo)

Your actions are not accidental
Only you no contester
Only you for the center
Everything I surrender
You dey give me bonanza
Ah ah ewo
At the mention of Your name oh
And as You step in at the place oh
Every other power go mellow
Everywhere go dey rearrange oh
Nobody fit say no
Number One cha cha cha
Original Abba Father
Everything go sha pra pra
Only you Oga kpata kpata kpata
Our Father wey dey for heaven
Nobody fit collect the chair
Wey You sit down
Our Papa
We gbadun Your pattern
And we throway salama
'Cause na You hold us down
These other gods
Wey them dey carry for pocket
I cannot relate
'Cause my Father is not their mate oh (I can never relate)
These other gods wey them dey keep for apartment
All of them are worthless
And I just dey laugh
Because my Father is bigger than (odo)
Any (odo)
Every (odogwu)
