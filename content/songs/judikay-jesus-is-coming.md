Jesus is Coming
Receive the Life of Christ
There is no Higher Life
There is no Greater Life than in Jesus
A Head Full of Information
Hand full of Money without Jesus
Is an empty Life
Only them that Believe in Jesus
Have Eternal Life
Receive Jesus Today
Jesus is Coming, Jesus is Coming
Jesus is Coming

He's Coming Again,
He's Coming Again, He's Coming Again
Glory be to GOD
He's Coming Again,
He's Coming Again,
He's Coming Again
Glory be to GOD
I Rejoice, I am so Glad
That Man who gave
His all for me is Coming Back
Let everyone Hear
Let every Heart Rejoice
That Man who gave
His all for you is Coming Back
Olilanya Nke ndinso
That Man who gave
His all for me is Coming Back
The Resurrection and the Life
That Man who gave
His all for me is Coming Back

Mighty Jesus
He's Coming Again,
He's Coming Again,
He's Coming Again
Glory be to GOD
Mighty Jesus
He's Coming Again,
He's Coming Again, He's Coming Again
Glory be to GOD
I have Hope of Eternal Life
That Man that gave
His all for me is Coming
My Bridegroom cometh
The One who owns my Life
That Man who gave
His all for me is Coming Back
We will be Transformed
In the Twinkling of an Eye
That Man who gave
His all for me is Coming Back
Let everyone Hear
Let every Heart Rejoice
That Man who gave
His all for you is Coming Back

Mighty Jesus
He's Coming Again,
He's Coming Again, He's Coming Again

Glory be to GOD
