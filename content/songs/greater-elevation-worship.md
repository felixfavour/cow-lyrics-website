God our strength, God our Savior, God our hope
Yours forever is the glory, the honor
God our shield, God our shelter, God our rock
Yours forever is the glory, the honor
The victory and power
You're greater, greater
There's no one like our God
You alone are worthy
God You are greater, greater
There's no one like our King
All the earth is singing
"God you are greater"You are, you are
God you are greater
You are, You are
God our peace, God our Father, God our rest
Yours forever is the glory, the honor
The victory and power
You're greater, greater
There's no one like our God
You alone are worthy
God You are greater, greater
There's no one like our King
All the earth is singing
"God you are greater"You are, you are
God you are greater
You are, You are
You have overcome the world
Took the keys from death and hell
Joining heaven we declare
You're greater, greater
You're greater, greater
There's no one like our God
You alone are worthy
God You are greater, greater
There's no one like our King
All the earth is singing
God you are greater, greater
There's no one like our God
You alone are worthy
God You are greater, greater
There's no one like our King
All the earth is singing
"God you are greater"You are, you are
God you are greater
You are, You are
