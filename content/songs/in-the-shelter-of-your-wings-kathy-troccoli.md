When I'm walking through the valley
Of the shadow of disaster
My dreams and broken visions at my feet
Through the disarrayed, I still can hear
The voice of my Master
Singing softly to remind me
I'm surrounded by Your grace
In this dark and lonely place
In the midst of shattered dreams
I'm in the shelter of Your wings
When my heart is torn between the good
And bad of my behavior
With a voice of accusation in my ears
Still I'm clinging to the never-ending promise
Of my Savior singing softly to remind me
I'm surrounded by Your grace
In this dark and lonely place
In the midst of shattered dreams
I'm in the shelter of Your wings
I'm surrounded by Your grace
In this dark and lonely place
In the midst of shattered dreams
I'm in the shelter of Your wings
I'm in the shelter of Your wings
