Savior I come quiet my soul
Remember redemption's hill
Where Your blood was spilled
For my ransom
[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I once held dear
I count it all as loss
Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out
Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself
I belong to You
Oh lead me lead me to the cross
You were as I tempted and 
trialled
 human
The word became flesh
Bore my sin and death
Now You're risen
[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I once held dear
I count it all as loss
