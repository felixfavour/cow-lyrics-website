've seen our dead come back to life
We see the lame come walk again
You do and this much more Oh God
We've seen you fight our battles lord
We've seen you win our battles lord
Oh God!
You Prevail
You Prevail
Lion of Judah You Prevail
We've seen you wipe our tears with joy
We've seen you cloth our shame with fame
You do this and much more Oh God
We've heard your news and here we are
We open our heart to you
To do this and much more Oh God
You Prevail
You Prevail
Lion of Judah You Prevail
