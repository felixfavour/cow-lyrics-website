Lord of all the earth
How You care for me
You have made me
You will save and carry me always
You are faithful
You are faithful
You are faithful
Your joy is my strength
Lord you are my God
I rely on You
I put my hope in things not seen
Your promises all true
Always you're with me
Your hand will lift me
My trust is in your hands
Always you're with me
Your hand will lift me
My trust is in your hands
