Oh, I can feel redemption on the wind
Forgiveness like the tide rolling in
Taking up the space where shame has lived
Receiving all that You died to give
Let the wind blow, let the tide roll
'Til the earth knows You're a God of love
Let my dry bones sing a new song
All the glory to the God of love
Hey
Oh, I can see a valley of dry bones
Rattling, moving bone to bone
You breathe a breath of life into our lungs, yeah, woo
Marching on our knees, we march to love
Let the wind blow, let the tide roll
'Til the earth knows You're a God of love
Let my dry bones sing a new song
All the glory to the God of love
Hey
