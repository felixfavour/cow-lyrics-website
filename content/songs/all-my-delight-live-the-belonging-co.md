Your blood has my future written
Your heart loves with no condition
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm invited into freedom, forgiven
Whiter than the snow
There’s a living fount I know
Where grace and mercy overflow
Love has come to set me free
I've got this joy inside of me
[Refrain]
All my delight
All my delight is found in You
All my delight
All my delight is found in You
Your joy is a force that can't be broken
Your hope is a gift that won’t be stolen
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, it's contagious, infectious
And it's burning in my soul
