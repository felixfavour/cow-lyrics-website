When the world turns its back and it feels like the end
Oh Lord, You are more than enough
When we're wounded and broken and needing a friend
Oh Lord, You are more than enough
Oh Lord, You are more than enough
A well spring of mercy and a fountain of love
We live to praise Your amazing grace
Oh Lord, You are more than enough
Precious Lord, You are more than enough
When we’ve done all we know and we're facing defeat
Oh Lord, You are more than enough
When Your word says hold on but the world says retreat
Oh Lord, You are more than enough
Much more than we ask or imagine
That's what Your love can do
And Lord, when Your strength fills our weakness
It’s more than enough, Lord, to lift us to You
Precious Lord, You are more than enough
More than enough
He's more than enough
So much more
Oh, yes He is
So much more
More than enough
