Uh In the middle of the trial, we find a place to laugh In the heart of wicked justice, we've forged ahead to grow Bumpy roads and darkened homelands don' t kill our will you know; Still we gotta go. II When the road that stands before you, looks like it never ends When the fire would devour you, or so it seems my friend, Well the more you sing, the more you, will make that trouble bend Sing and let it end (I am glad) Glad to walk the earth (I am glad) That I was born a Nigerian (I am glad) Glad to be alive Glad that I was born (I am glad) Oh I am happy (I am glad) To be a part of destiny (I am glad) Glad to walk the earth Glad that I was born III In the absence of a visa, With nowhere left to go We must stay and build up this our illustrious land of gold Happily with hearts of bliss as we work it yes we know Oh we' ll let it grow (oh yes) (I am glad) Glad to walk the earth (I am glad) That I was born a Nigerian (I am glad) Glad to be alive Glad that I was born (I am glad) Oh I am happy (I am glad) To be a part of destiny (I am glad) Glad to walk the earth Glad that I was born Bridge (2ce) There' s a place inside the dreamer That is reaching for the stars If I could only fly I'd make it up high I'll make it to the sky Oh I am happy, yes I am (I am glad, I am glad) Oh I am glad to be alive (I am glad, I am glad) If I could only fly, I'd make it up high I'll make it to the sky Oh I am happy, yes I am (I am glad, I am glad) Glad to be alive (I am glad, I am glad) If I could only fly, I'd make it up high I'll make it to the sky Glad to be alive (I am glad, I am glad) Glad that I was born (I glad, I am glad) If I could only fly I'd make it up high I'll make it to the sky
