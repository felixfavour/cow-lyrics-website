You're the God of second chances
You've been writing my story all along
You're the God of new beginnings
Grace has always kept me in Your arms
You're so much better than I think You are
The way You loved me from the very start
So much better than I think You are

You're so much better than I think You are
The way You loved me from the very start
So much better than I think You are
My soul knows it well

You've been writing my story all along

So much better than I think You are
My soul knows it well
You're so much better than I think You are
The way You loved me from the very start
So much better than I think You are
My soul knows it well
