He can make a way where there isn't a way
That's what the love of God can do
Everything can start new every day
That's what the love of God can do
The whole world changed when love stepped in
That's what the love of God can do
Hearts to save and a world to win
That's what the love of God can do
Chorus:
Love flies higher, walks through fire
Doesn't change from day to day
If it's really love, it just won't give up
Love will never pass away
(Repeat Verse)
Love is patient, love is kind
If someone else wins, love doesn't mind
Love believe and love forgives
And God is the start of all of this
(Repeat Verse)
