Anendlessocean, Ty Bello  Baptize Me Lyrics
Eternal streams
Without a measure
Spirit baptize me
so Christ can be seen in me
In deeper waters
Beyond my threshold
Spirit baptize me
so Christ is revealed in me
Let your Spirit baptize me
You're all that I need
May this love and this power be all over me
And let your Spirit come fill me
till you are revealed in me
Holy Spirit baptize me beyond ecstasy
May this love and this power be all over me
And let your spirit come fill me
till Christ is revealed in me
Till I am under
And you emerge
Spirit baptize me
so Christ can be seen in me
In your secret place
Where your deep calls out my deep
Spirit baptize me
so Christ is revealed in me
Let your Spirit baptize me
You're all that I need
May this love and this power be all over me
And let your Spirit come fill me
till you are revealed in me
Holy Spirit baptize me beyond ecstasy
May this love and this power be all over me
And let your Spirit come fill me
till Christ is revealed in me
I know, I'm sure that I know
You never leave me hanging
You're always here beside me
Yes, I know, I'm assured I know
Nothing can divide us
You leave no space between us
Till I walk like Jesus
Till I talk like Him
Until I'm just like Him
(chants)
Come fill me
Let your Spirit come fill me Lord
Here I am immerse me, consume me
Let your Spirit come fill me
Let your Spirit come fill me
Let your Spirit come fill me
You're all that I need
You're all that I need
