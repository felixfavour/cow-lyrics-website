[Intro: Adrienne Bailon Houghton and Israel & New Breed]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You are not alone, I'm with you
Everywhere you go, I'm there
You don't have to be afraid
I have always been the same
You are not alone, I'm with you
Every whisper I can hear
As close as breathing out My name
I'm aware of everything
You are not alone, I'm with you
[Chorus: Adrienne Bailon Houghton and Israel & New Breed]
So be still, be still
I am your peace, be still oh-oh
Be still, be still, woah
I am your peace, be still
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, You are my peace
You are my peace, oh
Oh, help me to be
Help me to be
Be, 
be still and know
You are my peace
You are my peace, oh
Oh, help me to be
Help me to
 
be, be
