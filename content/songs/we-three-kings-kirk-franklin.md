[Intro]
I'm looking for the star right now
I wonder where you are right now
(Wait a minute)
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star
(Whoo)
(Yah)
(Star)
(Let's go) born a king on Bethlehem’s plain
(Gold I bring) gold I bring to crown Him again (You are)
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign (Hallelujah)
(Sing) star you're so wonderful, you light up the night
Star you're so royal, and your beauty is bright (yes)
You're westward leading, still you're proceeding
(Guide us) guide us to the Light
(We won’t stop) we won’t stop
Until we see the light
