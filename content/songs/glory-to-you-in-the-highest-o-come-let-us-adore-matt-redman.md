From highest height of heavenâ€™s throne
And perfect light of majesty
This broken world became Your home
Our broken lives, You came to heal
Salvation in Your name and in Your heart our freedom
How could we not adore?
To us You have been born
To us You have been given
Glory to You in the highest
The hope of all the earth
The highest name of heaven
Glory to You in the highest
Glory to You, glory in the highest
Into the night, into the fray
Struggle and war on every side
Into a world of sin and shame
You came to bridge the great divide
The Prince of Peace, and Lord of Life
A day of grace has come
The dawn of our redemption
Let every heart adore
