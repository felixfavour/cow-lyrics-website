e of my best examples of getting married to God
Is found in the book of Exodus chapter thirty three
And God said to Moses
Moses you take the children of Israel to the Promise Land
But I will not go with you
Instead I will send an angel to go with you
Amazingly Moses behaved as if he didn't even hear what God said
And in verse twelve he asked the Lord and he said
You have said to us
Go to the Promise Land but You still haven't told me
Whom You will send to us
Haven't You said You know me by name
And that I have found favor in Your sight
Therefore if Your presence will not go with us
Then we are not leaving this place
And the Lord turned around and said to Moses
Yes Moses it is true I know you by name
And you have found favor in My sight
Therefore My presence will go with you
You know the truth
I would have been satisfied with the Angel
I mean can you imagine these swift Angels
But I guess Moses knew exactly what he was standing against
Because Angels only take orders
So if God says kill
There is a tendency that that's all
But if God is with them
At least with the Lord
There is mercy
Now I would have also been satisfied with the Presence of God
But Moses was not
And Moses said
How then shall we be different
Except You go with us
And he said but
Thank You for the Angel
This is my paraphrase
And thank You also for Your Presence
But I need something more
And I can imagine the Lord God
Turning His eyes to look upon Moses
And He's like Moses what else?
And Moses said Lord
Show me Your glory
Do you know what the glory of God is
What Moses was asking for was
I want to know what make God God
Where was God before He made the heaven and the earth
Where was He before He made the visible and the invisible
And God turned to Moses and said
You have asked a very difficult thing
For no man shall see Me and live
God said however
There is a place by Me
I will hide you in the cleft of the rock
And cover you with My hands
And I will make all my goodness to pass before you
Then I will take away My hands
And you will see My backside
But My face shall not be seen
You know the truth
I meditated about this passage and said who cares
Whether it's God's back or God's face
How do you know which is His back
And which is His face
This is a Being that has eyes all around Him
When He's going forward
He's actually going backward
When He's going to the left
He's actually going to the right
He is everywhere at the same time
Doing different things to different people
Then the Lord asked me
Do you know what Moses saw when he saw My back
I said Lord I know not
And He said to me I am not like you people
I don't have bum bum like you
And I said Lord what is it
And the Lord said to me
My back is eternity past
My face is eternity to come
When Moses saw My back
He saw the creation of all the galaxies
He saw how everything came to be
He saw how the sun was formed
He saw the very beginning of beginnings
He saw Adam and Eve in the garden
He met with Abraham Isaac and Jacob
And that was why he was able to write the book of Genesis
Perfectly without a single error
I thought about this
And I said Lord even I
I don't want to take one step without You going with me
Is that your prayer tonight
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
If You won't go with me Lord
Please don't send me
Even if You give me a million Angels
Please don't leave me
Because I see Your hand
In everything I do
I see Your hand
In the sun that shines
I see You hand
In the air I breathe
But I need Your face Jesus
I need Your Presence
Yes my Lord
I need Your face
That's all I need
That's all I need
That's all I need
That's all I need
(Is that all you need) That's all I need
That's all I need
I don't wanna be a prophet
I just wanna talk with You Lord
I am tired of being a bastard
I just wanna love You Lord
I don't want to be a Christian
But to be a child of God Lord
For You to be my closest friend
That's all I need
That's all I need
I see Your hand
In everything I do
I see Your hand
In the sun that shines
I see You hand
In the air I breathe
But I need Your face Jesus
I need Your Presence
Yes my Lord
I need Your face
(Because) That's all I need
(That's all) That's all I need
(Is that all you need) That's all I need
(That's all) That's all I need
(Is that all you need) That's all I need
(That's all) That's all I need
I don't wanna be a millionaire
But to share in the riches of Your glory
I don't want to be a superstar
But let the light of Your presence cover me
I have known You as my Savior
For this I am grateful Lord
So keep me in Your bosom
And You love me and You hug me
And You know me
That's all I need
(I see) I see Your hand
In everything I do
I see Your hand
In the sun that shines
I see You hand
In the air I breathe
But I need Your face Jesus
I need Your Presence
Yes my Lord
I need Your face
(Because) That's all I need
(That's all) That's all I need
(That is all I need) That's all I need
(That's all) That's all I need
(Is that all you need) That's all I need
(That's all) That's all I need
(Yes)
