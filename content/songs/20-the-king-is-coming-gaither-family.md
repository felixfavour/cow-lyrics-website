The marketplace is empty. No more traffic in the streets. All the builders' tools are silent. No more time to harvest wheat.

Busy housewives cease their labors. In the courtroom no debate. Work on earth has been suspended. As the King comes through the gate.

O the King is coming. The King is coming. I just heard the trumpets sounding. And now his face I see.

O the King is coming. The King is coming. Praise God, he's coming for me.

Happy faces line the hallways, those whose lives have been redeemed. Broken homes that He has mended, those from prison, He has freed.

Little children and the aged, hand in hand stand all aglow. Who were cripple, broken ruined, clad in garments white as snow. 

O the King is coming. The King is coming. I just heard the trumpets sounding. And now his face I see.

O the King is coming. The King is coming. Praise God, he's coming for me.

I can hear the chariots rumble. I can see the marching throng, the flurry of God's trumpet, spells the end of sin and wrong.

Regal robes are now enfolding, Heaven's grandstand all in place. Heaven's choir is now assembled, start to sing Amazing Grace. 

O the King is coming. The King is coming. I just heard the trumpets sounding. And now his face I see.

O the King is coming. The King is coming. Praise God, he's coming for me.
