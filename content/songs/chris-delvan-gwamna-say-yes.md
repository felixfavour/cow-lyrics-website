From the break of day,
I can hear the captain call
Do you hear him now?
Hoooooh hoooh
Pay a little more attention
Am sure you will hear his voice,
Calling out to us.
Hooooh hooooh
He's gotta plan, He keeps calling out for you,
Don't you resist him.
Hoooooh hooooh
Cause right there in his voice, is the nation of the earth,
Crying out for help...
Hooooh hoooh
Say yes to the people now in the England
Yes! to the people x2
Say yes oh yes!
Say yes to the people in Morocco
Yes! to the people x2
In Egypt, Syria, Libya
Say yes oh yes!
Say yes to the motherland in Russia, Poland, Ukraine and Angola
Yes! to the people x2
Say yes oh yes!
He wants to send you to the island of the earth,
Hoooh hoooh

He is looking for somebody,
Who will spread the goodnews, that he loves the world...

Right to his feet.

Take it from a brother...
