I'm totally abandoned to You
I'm lost inside the rivers of Your love
I'm swept into the power of Your presence
Drawn toward the whisper of Your voice
I come to You in quiet adoration
And fall before Your feet You are my King
I'm living for the beauty of Your Presence
To behold the glory of Your face
Chorus
Holy, Worthy, is the Lord
Heaven declares Your Rightousness
Oh God of All Creation
I worship You
Chorus
Oh when You said 'seek Your face'
My heart said 'Your face I will seek' (2x)
Chorus
