[Intro]
My God You never fail
You never have, You never will
Jesus You never fail
Your promise stands forever
Even when I fail
Even when I lose my way
You are always steadying my heart
Even when I run
You are never far away
You are always there with open arms
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh so I'm letting go, leaning in
To Your everlasting love
My God You never fail
You never have, You never will
Jesus You never fail
Your promise stands forever
Ever present One
You are faithful to Your word
What You have begun You will complete
Never changing One
You're my hope and future
And I know the plans You have for me
