In the shadows my spirit weak
Love broke through the darkness and lifted me
And I know You'll never let me go
In the storm in the raging sea
Love conquered the fear and delivered me
And I know You'll never let me go
Oh Love in the shadows
Be the Light Who leads me on
Your Love I will follow be my Guide
Your Will be done oh Lord
In the Arms of the One unseen
Love carried the cross that was meant for me
And I know You'll never let me go
Oh Love I surrender
Now forever I belong
In the Love of the Father
You are Faithful You are Strong
