You stepped down from heaven
Humbly you came
God of all creation
Here with us
In a starlit manger
Emmanuel
Light of the world
Here to save
Adore
Come let us adore
Oh come let us adore him
The Lord, worship Christ, the Lord
Let all that is within us
Adore
Wise men bring their treasures
Shepherds bow low
Angel voices sing of peace on earth
What have I to offer
To heaven's King
I'll bring my life, my love, my all
Adore
Come let us adore
Oh come let us adore him
The Lord, worship Christ, the Lord
Let all that is within us
Adore
