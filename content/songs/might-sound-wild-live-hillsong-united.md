Time moves in rhythm with His hand
Moment by moment
Beat by beat
Rolling through death both kick and snare
No rebel beat out skips His feats
And it might sound wild
But who on earth
Said our song should be tame
Let now the music chase His heart
Mercy by mercy
Note by note
We lost the pitch he moved the score
Our wayward notes
His sweet resolve
And it might sound wild
But wild is why my heart sings
Oh sing His praise till the other side
'Cause our hope came all the way
Imagine heaven where we stand
Not just some distant promised land
More than some hopeful dying dream
Watch it wind up just as He said
And when it does we'll sing
Like we wished we'd known
We should back then
And it might sound wild
But we don't have to wait till then
Singing
