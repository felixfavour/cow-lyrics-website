When we walk with the LORD
 In the Light of His WORD
 What a glory HE sheds on our way
While we do HIS good will
 HE abides with us still
And with all who will trust and obey
     Trust and obey
      For there is no other way
      To happy in JESUS
      But to trust and obey
Not a shadow can rise
Not a cloud in the skies
But HIS smile quickly drives it away
Not a doubt nor a fear
Not a sigh nor a tear
Can abide while we trust and obey
      Trust and obey
      For there is no other way
      To happy in JESUS
      But to trust and obey
in fellowship
We will sit at HIS feet
Or we'll walk by HIS side in the way
What HE says we will do
Where HE sends we will go
Never fear only trust and obey
        Trust and obey
For there is no other way
        To happy in JESUS
But to trust and obey
And tis so sweet to trust in JESUS
Just to take HIM at HIS WORD
Just to rest upon HIS promise
Just to know that says the LORD
 JESUS JESUS how I trust You
How I prove in all and all
JESUS JESUS precious JESUS
Of all grace to trust You more
