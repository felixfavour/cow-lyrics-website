In the fall You were there
Grace began before I was aware
A shame too great for me to hide
Covered now because of Jesus Christ
I can't believe
The price You paid for me
What You did not owe
So that I could know You
How can it be
You chose someone like me
To declare Your praise
For the glory of Your name
To the One who gave it all
I belong with all my heart and soul
And every gain I count as loss
When I survey the wonder of the cross
I can't believe
The price You paid for me
What You did not owe
So that I could know You
How can it be
You chose someone like me
To declare Your praise
For the glory of Your name
