I just wanna be close to Your heart
This is where my healing finds its start
Here is where I find my peace
Where my soul is finally free
[Chorus: Brandon Lake]
I'm going all in, in over my head
I'm not scared to get drenched in Your love
Wherever You go, God, I will follow
I'm not scared to get lost in Your love
I don't have to see where this road ends
Just as long as my hand's in Your hand
Here is where I wanna stay
Held within Your sweet embrace (
Oh
)
[Chorus: Brandon Lake & Sarah Reeves]
So I'm going all in, in over my head
I'm not scared to get drenched in Your love
Wherever You go, God, I will follow
I'm not scared to get lost in Your love
No, I'm not scared to get lost in Your love
[Bridge: Brandon Lake]
'Cause Your power's found in the roughest waters
Where I have no choice but to trust You, Father
Where my every fear has to surrender
I will trust in You forever
Take me there, oh, take me there
'Cause Your power's found in the roughest waters
 (Hey)
Where I have no choice but to trust You, Father
 (I trust You, Father)
Where my every fear has to surrender
I will trust in You forever
Take me there, oh, take me there
