Because of who you are I give you glory
Because of who you are I give you praise
Because of who you are I will lift my voice and say
'Lord, I worship you because of who you are.' (2x)
Jehovah Jireh, my provider
Jehovah Nissi, you reign in victory
Jehovah Shalom, my prince of peace
And I worship you because of who you are (2x)
Jehovah Rapha, you're my healer
Jehovah Shammah, always with me
Jehovah Sabaoth, strong deliverer
And I worship you because of who you are
Jehovah Jireh, Jehovah Nissi
Jehovah Shaalom, because of who you are
Jehovah Rapha, Jehovah Shalom
Jehovah Sabaoth, because of who you are
Jehova Jireh (provider)
Nissi (victory)
Shaalom (Prince of Peace)
Rapha (healer)
Shaamah (you're with me)
Sabaoth (strong deliverer)
Because of who you are
Jehova Jireh (provider)
Nissi (victory)
Shaalom (Prince of Peace)
Rapha (healer)
Shaamah (you're with me)
Sabaoth (deliverer)
Because of who you are
