Bind us together, Lord
Bind us together
With cords that cannot be broken
Bind us together, Lord
Bind us together
Bind us together in Love

There is only one God,
There is only one King
There is only one Body,
That is why we sing.

Fit for the glory of God,
Purchased by His precious Blood
Born with the right to be free
Jesus the victory has won.

We are the family of God
We are the promise divine
We are God's chosen desire
We are the glorious new wine.
