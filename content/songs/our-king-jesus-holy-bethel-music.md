A thousand flawless lifetimes wouldn't be enough
To measure up to how You lived here in just one
You are true perfection
None compare to You
Trading in Your exaltation for our shame
To embrace a crucifixion in our place
Crushing death forever
You're now forever risen
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy are You, Lord
Worthy, worthy, worthy
Worthy, worthy, worthy
Worthy, worthy, worthy are You, King Jesus
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Holy, holy, holy are You Lord
Heaven's endless worship flows before Your throne
Where all You are is everything that they behold
It's the only right response
In the glory of the Son
Mm-mm-mm
