Let your living waters flow out of me
Let your Holy Spirit overshadow me
As it was in the beginning, so let it be now
I am the city, the city of God
Let your living waters flow out of me
Flow out of me
Let your Holy Spirit overshadow me
As it was in the beginning, so let it be now
I am the city, the city of God
Eden is no more a place
I am the city of God
I bring heaven
Heaven here and now
Eden is no more a place
I am the city of God
I bring heaven
Heaven here and now
Let your living waters flow out of me
Let your Holy Spirit overshadow me
As it was in the beginning, so let it be now
I am the city, the city of God
