Your world is forever
Settled on the Earth
And your plan is for me is perfect and complete
[Bridge:]
I know that I can trust you
I am secure in you
[Chorus:]
So I never have to be afraid
I can trust you God
Trust you sovereign God
No matter what may come my way
I can trust you God
Trust you sovereign God
Your world is forever
Settled on the Earth
And your plan is for me is perfect and complete
I’m in your world
I’m in your hand
I can forever trust your plan
[Repeat]
