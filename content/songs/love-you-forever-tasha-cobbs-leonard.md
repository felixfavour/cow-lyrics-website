Your goodness, your mercy and your kindness towards me
Your love is so amazing it brings me to my knees
Ooh gonna love you for ever
Ooh gonna love you for ever
Its a real simply song
Ooh gonna love you forever
Ooh gonna love you forever
Lord your like the river that never runs dry
My heart is your temple living inside
Lord you are the air I breathe to keep me alive
Lord I need you close please say around
Lord I need you close please say around
You won't ever give up on me
And all that I have will never be
Enough to show you how much I love you
Lord I'm gonna try, try, try, try, try, try
Lord your like the river that never runs dry
My heart is your temple living inside
Lord you are the air I breathe to keep me alive
Lord I need you close please say around
Lord I need you close please say around
