When we were lost ones
You were the Shepherd that carried us home
When we were prodigals
You ran to meet us with open arms
And we can't hold back our praise
When we were refugees
You were the One who took us in
When we were enemies
You paid the price for all our sin
And we can't hold back our praise
This is the sound of adoration
Oh, how we love You
Jesus, we love You
You are the joy of all creation
Oh, how we love You
Jesus, we love You
You are the Risen One
You conquered death and made a way
You sang our freedom song
Now we are dancing on our chains
And we can't hold back our praise
