Live (Yeah), yeah, live, yeah (Yeah)
God said live (God said live)
God said live
God said live (God said live)
God said live (God said live)
God said live (God said live)
And the bones began to rattle (Rattle, rattle, rattle)
God said live (God said live)
God said live (God said live)
God said live (God said live)
God said live (God said live)
God said live (God said live)
God said live (God said live)
God said live (God said live)
God said live (God said live)
This is what He said
Live (Live), live (Live)
Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord
Live (Live), live (Live)
Dry (Dry) bones, hear the word of the Lord
Live (Live), live (Live)
Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord
Live (Live), live (Live)
This is the sound
Of dry bones rattling
This is the praise
Make a dead man walk again
Open the grave
I'm coming out
I'm gonna live
Gonna live again
Open the grave
I'm coming out
I'm gonna live
Gonna live again
This is the sound
Of dry bones rattling
