I had my shares of up and down
times when there's no one around
God came and spoke these words to me
praise will confuse the enemy
I started singing
I started clapping
I started dancing
people were laughing
they knew my problems
they knew my pain
but I knew God will take them away
that's why I praise him with my hands
that's why I praise him in advance
he's given me a second chance
come on let's praise in advance
that's why I praise him a song
when things are right and things are wrong
he's given a second chance
come on let's praise him in advance
