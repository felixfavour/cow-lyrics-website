has disappeared
The dirt has washed away
And now it's clear

There's only grace
There's only love
There's only mercy and believe me it's enough
Your sins are gone
Without a trace
And there's nothing left now
There's only grace
You're starting over now
Under the sun
You're stepping forward now
A new life has begun
There's only grace
There's only love
There's only mercy and believe me...it's enough

Your sins are gone
Without a trace
And there's nothing left now
There's only grace...
And if you should fall again
Get back up, get back up
Reach out and take my hand
Get back up, get back up
Get back up again
There's only love
There's only mercy and believe me it's enough.
Your sins are gone
Without a trace
And there's nothing left now
There's only...there's only...GRACE...
There's only mercy and believe me it's enough...it's enough
There's only grace
There's only love
And there's nothing left now
There's only  GRACE... There's only...
There's only  GRACE...
