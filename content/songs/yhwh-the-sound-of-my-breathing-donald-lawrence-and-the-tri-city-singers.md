Four Hebrew symbols transcribed
Y-H
W-H
Inhale
Exhale
Who am I that Thou are mine?
Full of me
Creator, my God, who blew the breath of life in me
Thou hast gifted your DNA to me
Now I speak Your name
I speak Your name
Every time I breathe
Every time I breathe
Spoke to Moses way, way back when
When he asked Your name he heard the sound
He heard the sound
Of the wind
(The wind)
Four Hebrew consonants
I wonder what You speak
I speak Your name every time I breathe
God, Your name is the sound of my breathing
The sound of my breathing
I speak Your name every time I breathe
God, Your name is the sound of my breathing
And I am Him
Oh, Lord, I speak Your name every time I breathe
(When I exhale)
I speak Your name
