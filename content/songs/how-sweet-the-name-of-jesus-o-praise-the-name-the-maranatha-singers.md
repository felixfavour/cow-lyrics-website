How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear
It soothes his sorrows heals his wounds
And drives away his fear
It makes the wounded spirit whole
And calms the troubled breast
'Tis manna to the hungry soul
And to the weary rest
O praise the name of Jesus
The name high over all
The highest heaven cannot contain
Its greatness and its power
Dear Name the rock on which I build
My shield and hiding place
My never failing treasury filled
With boundless stores of grace
Jesus my Shepherd Brother Friend
My Prophet Priest and King
My Lord my Life my Way my End
Accept the praise I bring
