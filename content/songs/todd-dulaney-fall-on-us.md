Fresh anointing fall on me
I heard how the old church used to be,
I wanna see revival in this world today
Fresh anointing fall on me
I heard how the old church used to be,
I wanna see revival in this world today,
We wanna see your glory,
Yes God,
Let it fall like rain
We wanna feel your power,
let it fill this place.
Fresh anointing fall on me
I heard how the old church used to be,
I wanna see revival in this world today
Fresh anointing fall on me
I heard how the old church used to be,
I wanna see revival in this world today.
We wanna see your glory,
Let it fall like rain
We wanna feel your power,
let it fill this place.
We wanna see your glory,
Let it fall like rain.
We wanna feel your power
Let it fill this place.
(Insturmetals)
We long to see your glory,
 live to see your power,
fall on us,fall on us.
We long to see your glory,
live to see your power,
fall on us,

Fall on us
