Among the gods, 'mong the gods
Who is like Thee?
You are glorious in holiness
Fearful in praises
Doing wonders, hallelujah!
And who is like unto Thee?
Oh, Lord, come on, come on
Who is like unto Thee? Tell Him, tell Him
Oh, Lord, oh (Oh, oh, Lord)
Say it again, who is
Who is like (Unto Thee?)
Oh, Lord (Oh, Lord)
Who is like (unto Thee?)
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord (Oh, Lord)
Among the gods, say
Among the gods, among the gods
Who is like Thee? (Glorious in holiness)
You are glorious in holiness (Fearful in praise)
Fearful in praises (Doing wonders)
Doing wonders, hallelujah (Come on, come on)
Among the gods, say
Among the gods, among the gods
Who is like Thee?
You are glorious in holiness
Fearful in praises (Doing wonders)
Doing wonders, hallelujah!
