I don’t know where you are
I know you in the building somewhere
I had a chance to go to, Africa
And, there was a sound
There’s a word release called Baba
Which means father
An I heard this young man by the name of Sonnie Badu
Who’s absolutely anointed
And he sings something like this
Open the flood gates, in abundance
And cause your rain to fall on me
Open the flood gates, in abundance
And cause your rain to fall on me
We’re in your presence let it rain
Oh, your rain (Jesus)
We’re in your presence let it rain
Oh, your rain
Let it fall on me (everybody help me say)
Open the flood gates, in abundance
And cause your rain to fall on me
Open the flood gates (come on everybody lift your voice)
In abundance and cause your rain to fall on me
