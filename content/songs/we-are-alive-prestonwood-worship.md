No weapon ever formed
No enemy that roars
Could ever make His children hide
We're covered by His love
And we will never run
We stand together in His light
No weapon ever formed
No enemy that roars
Could ever make His children hide
We're covered by His love
And we will never run
We stand together in His light!
Arise, arise
Stand tall, through the night
Be brave, our God
Is here by our side
We are His Church
We are alive!
His Kingdom stands alone
It can't be overthrown
His rule and reign will never end
Let generations sing
Our soon and coming King
Calls us for such a time as this
Calls us for such a time as this!
