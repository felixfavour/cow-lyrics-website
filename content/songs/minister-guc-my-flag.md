Mmmmm
Am still standing after all I have been through
Then I'll wave my flag to show that I'm alive
I've been through so much many huddles
I'm not going back this time around
I'm not going back this time around
.. .... . . uuuuhhhh...
I'll wave my flag
I'll host it up for all to see
That God is good
He never sleep he never fail
I'm not going back this time around
I'm not going back this time around
I'll wave my flag
My testimony is written all over here
And I'll show the scores to the world
That God is been good all the time anywhere
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Yes I'm still standing after all the in me
I'm still dancing after all the broken songs
The light of my life saved me
The love of my life was bl
I'm still standing
Blown in k
