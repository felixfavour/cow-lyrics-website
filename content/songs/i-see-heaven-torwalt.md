I see heaven invading this place
I see angels praising Your holy name
And I sing praises, I sing praises
I give You honor, worthy Jesus

I see glory falling in this place
I see hope restored, healing of all disease
And I sing praises, I sing praises
I give You honor, worthy Jesus

We give You praise and all of the honor
You are our God, the one we live for
We give You praise and ll of the glory God
(repeat)

Let you presence fill this place, 
Let heaven come
Let Your angels be release, 
Let heaven come

We will worship at Your feet
Let heaven come
Face to face we want to meet
Let heaven come

Let you presence fill this place, 
Let heaven come
Let Your angels be release, 
Let heaven come

We will worship at Your feet
Let heaven come
Face to face we want to meet
Let heaven come

We give You praise and all of the honor
You are our God, the one we live for
We give You praise and ll of the glory God
(repeat)
