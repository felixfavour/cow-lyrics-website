I find myself in uncharted territory
Never felt so lost
Never felt so lonely
Where are You Lord
I'm so afraid
I can feel the fear inside me
Can't control the chaos all around me
Where are You Lord
How can I sing the Lord's song in a foreign land?
(But) How can I forget
All You've done for me
Everything You've done Lord
Just to set me free
Teach me how to pray
Teach me how to praise
Even in the darkness
Teach me how to sing Your song
How can I sing
When my heart is broken
When every prayer is just a token
Where are You Lord
