I got so much faith in you, Lord I trust your words it's true
No matter the circumstance, my life is in your hands
I've got confidence, so much confidence, in you
I've got confidence, so much confidence, in you
Your love has been so good to me, it's so unfailing
My heart is in your hands, you hold the master plan
I've got confidence, so much confidence in you
I've got confidence, so much confidence in you
I like this part
[Hook]
Your ways are higher
Your thoughts are deeper
I can't even imagine
How you do what you do, but you do what you do
I've got confidence, so much confidence in you
Somebody just tell them
I've got confidence(), so much confidence in you
Lets do it again
[Hook]
Lord ways are,(higher)
And Your thoughts are (deeper)
So much deeper
I can't even imagine
How you do what you do, but you do what you do
I've got confidence, so much confidence in you
I've got confidence, so much confidence in you
