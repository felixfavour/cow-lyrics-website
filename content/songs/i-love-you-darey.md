[Chorus: Dare Art Alade]
I love you, yes I do
I love you, yes I do
Don't mind the things I say
I love you the same way
Don’t mind the things I do
I always love you
I love you, yes, yes I do
I love you, yes I do
Don't mind the things I say
I love you the same way
Don't mind the things I do
I’ll always love you
And I miss you, yes I do
I miss you, yes I do
Don't mind the things I say
I miss you the same way
Don't mind the things I do
I always love you
Hey now
Play your trumpet my brother, play your trumpet
Let them hear it
Let's flip it
Maybe sometime you can ease my mind
Tell mе the way you feel
But girl, you should listen to what I say
'Cause I lovе you in everyway
