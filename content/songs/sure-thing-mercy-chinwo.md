Oh aye bada, ade
Oh aye bada, ade
And even if do dada aye

When God put song for your mouth oh
And melody in your heart o

When God put song for your mouth oh

Now I deh yarn you tory
Everything way I get o
No be my power na by him grace oo
Na why I de always give am praise o
'Cause na the sure thing to do
This God don put song for my mouth o
And melody in your heart o

'Cause na the sure thing to do
