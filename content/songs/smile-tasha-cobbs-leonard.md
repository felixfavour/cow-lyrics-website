Here's my worship
Take joy in it
Make it your dwelling place
I wanna put a smile on your face
I present my heart to you
I present my live to you
(Repeat)
Here's my worship, smile
Here's my life Lord, smile
(Repeat)
Smile, I wanna make you smile
Smile, I wanna make you smile
Smile, I wanna make you smile
Smile, I wanna make you smile
I present my heart to you
I present my life to you
You won't let me down
You won't break my heart
You won't let me fall
So i give it to you.
