Hope has come and Love has won
God is here in mercy
Songs resound and justice flows
Healing rivers from Your throne
Your heart of love has broken through
The cross of Christ our freedom
Your presence like the oceans rise
We pray and praise and lift You high
We pray and praise and lift You high
Your Kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as in Heaven
Your Kingdom reign
From age to age
Both now and forever
Spirit of the Living God
Moving like a rushing wind
Here on earth our hearts alive
We're set apart with holy fire
God, fill us now with holy fire
Your Kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as in Heaven
Your Kingdom reign
From age to age
Both now and forever
[Thom Macken:]
You are here; You are near
You are coming, You are coming
You are here; You are near
You are coming, You are coming
You are here; You are near
You are coming, You are coming
You are here; You are near
You are coming, You are coming
You are coming!
[Darlene Zschech:]
Let the Heavens shout, the wonder of Your coming
All creation groans, in longing for the King
And let the thirsty come, and drink from Living Water
As Your Kingdom comes, arrayed in majesty
Your Kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as in Heaven
Your Kingdom reign
From age to age
Both now and forever
Let the Heavens shout, the wonder of Your coming
All creation groans, in longing for the King
And let the thirsty come, and drink from Living Water
As Your Kingdom comes, arrayed in majesty
And let the Heavens shout, the wonder of Your coming
All creation groans, in longing for the King
And let the thirsty come, and drink from Living Water
As Your Kingdom comes, arrayed in majesty!
