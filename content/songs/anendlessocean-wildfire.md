Bloodline
La familia
I wanna love you this time and forever
In particular
Sincerely you and I
Be very unusual
To find any other
Who's gon love me harder than you
How do I co co cope
Where do I go go go
Body and soul soul soul
Only for you

You're in control
You take my issues solve them one by one and yea two by two
I want it
Let your spirit come move in me
Shake me inside and turn me outside and let it rest pon me
Oh you're the you're the only one
Who makes me complete
Spread through me like wild fire
Wild fire
Seek and hide
In my direction please
Blow my mind
And put me at ease
See I only feel alright
Knowing you're here with me
And I don't want no other
No other but you

Shake me inside and turn me outside and let it rest pon me
Oh you're the you're the only one
Who makes me complete
