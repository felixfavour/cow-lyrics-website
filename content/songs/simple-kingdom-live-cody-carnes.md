Your Kingdom is simple, as simple as love
You welcome the children, You stop for the one
We wanna see people the way Jesus does
Your Kingdom is simple, Lord, teach it to us
Your Kingdom is humble, as humble as death
This King is a Savior who gave His last breath
So may we die daily, our pride laid to rest
Your Kingdom is humble and the broken are blessed
Hallelujah, hallowed be Your name
May we live and breathe Your praise
And hallelujah, let all creation sing
Oh, the King of Heaven reigns
Your Kingdom is coming, Your Kingdom is here
Alive in our waiting, at work in our tears
So come to us quickly, forever our prayer
Your Kingdom is coming, Lord Jesus, come near
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallowed be Your name
May we live and breathe Your praise
Oh hallelujah, let all creation sing
Oh, the King of Heaven reigns
That's it, sing it again
Hallelujah, hallowed be Your name
May we live and breathe Your praise
Oh hallelujah, let all creation sing
Oh, the King of Heaven reigns
Jesus reigns, Jesus reigns
Oh, Jesus reigns forever
He reigns forever
