Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?
The King of glory, the King above all kings
Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder?
Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?
The King of glory, the King above all kings (let's go)
This is amazing grace, this is unfailing love
That You would take my place, that You would bear my cross
You laid down Your life, that I would be set free
Oh, Jesus I sing for all that You've done for me
Who brings our chaos back into order?
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter?
The King of glory, the King of glory
Who rules the nations with truth and justice
Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance?
The King of glory, the King above all kings (yeah)
