We are worlds we are bodies
Empires of dirt and grace
Silhouettes and reflections
Caught in his holy flame
[Pre-Chorus: Joel Houston]
Beneath our skin
A new creation
The night is done
Our chains are broken
Our time has come
The wait is over
The King is here
And His name is Jesus
[Chorus: Joel Houston]
This is love bending skies to heal the broken
This is love bleeding life into the grave
Hear the sound as our hearts cry out forever
Singing hallelujah
Breathing in a brand new world, oh
We are shadows and portraits
Empires of life and clay
Images of our maker
Sinners called out as saints
