Faith that moves the mountains
Faith that roars the sea

Oh by faith, Jericho fell, mountains removed, kingdoms subdued
Oh by faith, the red sea dried, Pharoah consumed, victory won

Faith that opens heaven
Faith that sends the rain

Oh by faith, provision came, water to wine, and manna fell.
Oh by faith, 5 loaves of bread, 5 thousand fed, 12 baskets left.

Faith that tears through Hades
Faith that brings to life

Oh by faith, Sarah conceived, Isaac the seed, promise received. 
Oh by faith, LORD JESUS died, trusted His GOD, and He was raised.

Faith that drives to prayers 
Faith that wages war.

Man of faith, woman of faith, will you arise, and take your place.
Just like Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David and Samuel

Spirit of Faith, Spirit of Power
Spirit of Faith, Spirit of Power
Spirit of Faith, Consume me.

I walk by faith, not by sight
I walk by faith, not by sight
I walk by faith, My faith is sight

No impossibility
No impossibility
BY FAITH
