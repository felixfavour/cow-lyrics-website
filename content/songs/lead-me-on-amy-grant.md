Shoulder to the wheel
For someone else's selfish gain
Here there is no choosing
Working the clay
Wearing their anger like a ball and chain
Fire in the field
Underneath the blazing sun
But soon the sun was faded
And freedom was a song
I heard them singing when the day was done
Singing to the Holy One
[Hook]
Lead me on, lead me on
To a place where the river runs
Into Your keeping, oh
Lead me on, lead me on
The awaited deliverance
Comforts the seeking, lead on
Waiting for the train
Labeled with a golden star
Heavy hearted boarding
Whispers in the dark
"Where are we going--is it very far?"
