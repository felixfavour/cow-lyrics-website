You are holy and true, I bring to You
Praises in the morning
Blessed Lamb of God, revealed spoken Word
I’ll praise You for You’re worthy
You are mighty to save, faithful, supreme
Son of Righteousness
I exalt You my King, of Your reign I will sing
Glory to God
For You’re worthy of glory, worthy of honour
I lift up Your holy Name
All heaven and earth will praise You and declare
Jesus, You’re King!
You are mighty to save, faithful, supreme
Son of Righteousness
I exalt You my King, of Your reign I will sing
Glory to God, in the highest
You are mighty to save, faithful, supreme
Son of Righteousness
I exalt You my King, of Your reign I will sing
Glory to God
