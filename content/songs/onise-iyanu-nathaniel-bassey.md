Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Onise Iyanu
You are the God of awesome wonders
I've tasted of your power
Onise Iyanu
You have shown me so much mercy
Much more than I deserve
My eyes have seen, my ears have heard
The wonders of your praise
Creation bows in awe of you
And we join to give you praise
The words you speak turns things around
Your outstretched arm
Has lifted me
You took away the chains and colts
That held me bound
Onise Iyanu
You are the God of awesome wonders
I've tasted of your power
Onise Iyanu
You have shown me so much mercy
Much more than I deserve
