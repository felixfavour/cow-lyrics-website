1: If I have up to a thousand tongues,
To praise the lord our God,
The glories of the Lord our King,
His victory and His grace,
Chorus: Did He not satisfy you?
Did He not satisfy me?
His Blood has made us whole,
His Blood has made us whole.

2: Jesus turns my sorrows to joy,
He erased all sadness,
He sees me as a great sinner,
Long life resounding health,
Chorus: Did He not satisfy you?
Did He not satisfy me?
His Blood has made us whole,
His Blood has made us whole.

3: My Father and my Almighty,
Give me a helping hand,
That I may proclaim to the world,
Through Thy gracious name,
Chorus: Did He not satisfy you?
Did He not satisfy me?
His Blood has made us whole,
His Blood has made us whole.

4: Thou sing and the deaf hear,
The blinds see salvation,
The trouble spirits burst for joy,
Brethren shout and rejoice,
Chorus: Did He not satisfy you?
Did He not satisfy me?
His Blood has made us whole,
His Blood has made us whole. Amen
