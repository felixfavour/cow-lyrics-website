Awake sleeping soldier
the time is now
the time is now oh
Awake sleeping soldier
the time is now
the time is now oh
Awake sleeping soldier
the time is now
the time is now oh
awake my fathers children
the harvest is ripe but the laborers are few
awake my fathers children
the harvest is ripe but the laborers are few
if you have been sleeping wake up
if you have been sleeping wake up
there is no time again oh
if you have been sleeping wake up
if you have been sleeping wake up
if you have been sleeping wake up
there is no time again oh
awake my fathers children
for the harvest is ripe and the laborers are few
we need more laborers
we need men
we need men that will come out
beyond coming to church on Sunday
beyond coming to church midweek service
we need men that will rise
speaking in tongues
that is the call to wake up2
we need men beyond coming to hear pastor
what bible have you read
have you sat down to know what is in the scriptures
we need men
that is the call to wake up
 Every day pastor this pastor that
we need men to check the scriptures again
we need men to wake up at midnight hours to pray
we need men to fast
we need men no more calling of pastors in the midnight
you face any challenge
(speaks in tongues)
it might be so funny but this is the call to wake up
beyond the song
beyond the lyrics
beyond the fine boy
beyond the fine girl
God needs men
that is a call to wake up
will you continue in sin that grace may abound
its a call to wake up
will you continue in sin
if you do this one
you come to church on Sunday and lead praise and worship
pastor will not see me
you are enjoying yourself in iniquity
but don't forget he said on the last day
I will say get away from me all ye workers of iniquity
you did everything in my name but I don't know you
 there is a call to wake up
oh soldier I came yo tell you that you have been a civilian for too long
have been a civilian in the church
 for too long
 there is a place for civilians and there is a place for soldiers
