You heal the broken hearted
You set the captive free
You lift the heavy burden
And even now You are lifting me
There is no healer like the Lord, our Maker
There is no equal to the King of kings
Our God is with us, we will fear no evil
'Cause You do impossible things
You do impossible things
Though I walk through the valley
Darkness surrounding me
There You prepare a table
In the presence of my enemies
There is no healer like the Lord, our Maker
There is no equal to the King of kings
Our God is with us, we will fear no evil
'Cause You do impossible things
You do impossible things
