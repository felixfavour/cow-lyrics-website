[Intro]
Come on, is there anybody in this place who loves Jesus?
Me too, come on, we're gonna sing with everything we got
Salvation sounds a new beginning
As distant hearts begin believing, amen
Redemption's bid is unrelenting
Your love goes on
Your love goes on
[Pre-Chorus]
When the world gives way
You carry us, carry us
With Your endless grace
You cover us, cover us
Your love is relentless (Come on, I wanna hear you sing it loud)
Your love is relentless (A little bit louder)
Your love is relentless (Here we go)
Your love is relentless
Yeah, your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
Your love is relentless
