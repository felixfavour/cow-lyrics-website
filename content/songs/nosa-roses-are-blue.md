asons are changing
The leaves are all fallen
And I'm here just waiting
To go from empty to full
Think you can play me a fool
I'm used to liars like you
So I will go to the moon
Where disappointment can't rule
Where solitude is my fuel
And not something used as a tool
For hatred
Isolation from you
Oh you
Roses are blue
When I lose you again
Oh again
And violets are red
When you say less
I'm blind
So blind
Reeling from feeling this healing alone
Gave me the bluest and loneliest of the roses
Roses
You gave me roses
The bluest roses
To me
Oh me
Roses are blue
When I lose you again
Oh again
