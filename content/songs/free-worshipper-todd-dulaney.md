Free to dance and sing, Free to lift my hands and worship, Lord I'm free, Lord I'm free
I'm a free Worshipper, I'm a free Worhipper, I'm a free Worshipper. Lord I'm free
I thank God I'm Free and I'll never be bound again
(repeat 4 times)
Return to Lord I'm Free
(Repeatedly Follow Lead)
Ohh, Ohh, Ohh, Lord I'm Free
(Follow Lead)
Whom the Son set free is free indeed
(repeat 2 times)
I am free. Praise the Lord I'm free
No longer bound. No more chains holding me
My soul is resting. It's just a blessing. Praise the Lord Hallelujah I'm Free
