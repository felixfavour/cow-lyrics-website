There is a promise hanging over my head
You will perform it just like You said
You're no man that, that You should lie
You feel no fear, so
Why should I?
Why should I? Yeah
Somehow
Somehow
You'll come through
Like You always do
Somehow
Somehow
You'll step in
For I know this is not my end (Woo)
Not my end
There is a promise, yeah (There is a promise)
