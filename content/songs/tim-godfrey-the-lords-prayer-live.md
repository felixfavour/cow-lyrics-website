Just wave those hands
Our Father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Let your kingdom come
Let your will be done
On Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread
For thine is the kingdom and power
and glory forever and ever
For thine is the kingdom and power
and glory forever and ever
And forgive us our sin
as we forgive our neighbors
and lead us not into temptation
and deliver us from evil
deliver us, deliver us, deliver us
deliver us, deliver us, deliver us
deliver us, deliver us, deliver us
deliver us, deliver us, deliver us
ooooooooooooo
For thine is the kingdom and power
and glory forever and ever
For thine is the kingdom and power
and glory forever and ever
For thine is the kingdom and power
and glory forever and ever
For thine is the kingdom and power
and glory forever and ever
For thine is the kingdom and power
and glory forever and ever
For thine is the kingdom and power
and glory forever and ever
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
AMEN
