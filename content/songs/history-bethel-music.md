[Chorus]
You and I, we've got history
We go way, way back
We go way, way back
You and I, we've got history
We go way, way back
We go way, way back
For eons I thought about you
Before I ever made you
I wrote every moment down
You were all my idea
Above all I created
You are my most precious crown
You and I, we've got history
We go way, way back
We go way, way back
You and I, we've got history
We go way, way back
We go way, way back
I saved words just to say to you
Before you ever met me
So take some time and hear them now
I gave you my greatest gift
My love cannot be measured
You're my treasure, You're my child
