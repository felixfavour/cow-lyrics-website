If your deep in the ocean high on the mountain
then my worship will chase you
My one desire is to never be too far away
so draw me closer to touch you.
(repeat 4xs)
Here's my heart of worship I give it too you father, father
Here's my heart of worship I give it too you, whoa oooo.
(repeat going up step each time)
I give it to you whoa, oooo.
(repeat)
If your deep in the ocean, high on the mountain
Lord my worship will chase you.
My one desire is to never be too far away,
so draw me closer to touch you.
Draw me close enough to touch you
Draw me close enough to touch you.
