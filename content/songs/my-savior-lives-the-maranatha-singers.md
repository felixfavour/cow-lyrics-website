Our God wil reign forever
And all the world will know His name
Everyone together sing the song of the redeemed
I know that my redeemer lives
And now I stand on what He did
My Saviour, my Saviour lives
Every day a brand new chance to say
"Jesus, You are the only way"My Saviour, my Saviour lives
The King has come from Heaven
And darkness trembles at His name
Victory forever is the song of the redeemed
I know that my redeemer lives
And now I stand on what He did
My Saviour, my Saviour lives
Every day a brand new chance to say
"Jesus, You are the only way"My Saviour, my Saviour lives
My Saviour lives, My Saviour lives, My Saviour lives
My Saviour lives, My Saviour lives, My Saviour lives
