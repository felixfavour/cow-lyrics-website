Here's my heart, Lord
Here's my heart, Lord
Here's my heart, Lord
Speak what is true
Here's my heart, Lord
Here's my heart, Lord
Here's my heart, Lord
Speak what is true
Cause I am found, I am Yours
I am loved, I'm made pure
I have life, I can breathe
I am healed, I am free
Here's my heart, Lord
Here's my heart, Lord
Here's my heart, Lord
Speak what is true
Cause I am found, I am Yours
I am loved, I'm made pure
I have life, I can breathe
I am healed, I am free
Cause You are strong, You are sure
You are life, You endure
You are good, always true
You are light breaking through
