Hold on to me
I am weak without You
I can't breathe without You
But I can make it through
If You hold on to me
When my life is broken
Still Your arms are open
Your love can make me new
You are my everything
I run into Your name
Jesus, Jesus
I know my world is safe
Forever in Your name
Jesus, Jesus
Hold on to me
I am weak without You
I can't breathe without You
But I can make it through
If You hold on to me
When my life is broken
Still Your arms are open
Your love can make me new
