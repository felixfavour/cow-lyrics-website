Listen to me O ye Heavens
Give me your ears O ye Earth
Let my words be like the rain
And like the dew that falls upon the herb that grows in the fields
Praise the Lord O ye people, come praise him for his wisdom
He has kept his praise away with little children and sucklings of the earth
And his wisdom can only be found, with the low things here on the earth
His praise is firmly established, in the church of the living Christ
As he is now in the heavens, so are we right here on the earth
To rule the earth with a rod of iron until all his enemies bow
We have power over all the nations;
we are riding on the eagle wings
Jesus our head once was dead,
but now He lives forevermore
We are the light of the world,
we are a city that is set on a hill
We are the salt of the earth,
streams from the river of joy
No man ever lights a candle only to keep it in a hidden place
We are here on earth for a plan and a reason, dominion is our call
We are not rats that run in a hopeless race;
we are lions in a winning race
We have power over all the powers of the enemies; the devil is a defeated foe
Come to me all ye who are weak and are heavy laden
Come drink in the words of life,
the word of the Lord is a weapon my friend And of the increase of His kingdom there shall be no end
The word of the Lord will not fail
Until Shiloh come (3x)
The word of the Lord will not fail
Until Shiloh come (3x)
Jesus the light of the world He is the hope of all creation
Redeemer and mighty Lord, King of kings He's the Lord of lords
But now I see an evil under the sun, something wrong in the house of the king
The sons of Zion are held down in captivity, while their servants ride upon a horse
Ye are gods all ye children of the Most High. You'll only prosper by the truth you know
If the foundation of your life is destroyed, what shall the righteous man do?
You put your hands to the plough but you look back, so you're not worthy for the prize of the call
See the whole creation is groaning they are calling for the sons to show
But a man of honour who doesn't understand, surely will die like a beast in the fields
It was Moses the father himself who showed us the way; he said a prophet will the Most High raise
And unto Him shall the gathering of the people be, we seek a city whose foundation is the Lord 
Come out from amongst them, time to take command is come
You must follow Jesus the Lamb of God, He's our example
Hold the Lamb, hold Him till the end
Hold the Lamb no matter the pressure
Hold the Lamb and every word He says
Hold Him till the end of time
The word of the Lord will not fail
Until Shiloh come (3x)
