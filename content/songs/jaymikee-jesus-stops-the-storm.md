1. there are times in life
when we go through situations
  make it seem like complications or maybe tribulations
as it keeps you up at night
you're looking for the bigger picture
so you open up the scripture
and here's what you see inside
just like years ago
the disciples were rowing on a boat
travelling through the ocean
and they called on to Jesus
when the waters was blowing
 and he showed them the impossible
CHORUS
Jesus stops the storm
Jesus stops the storm
Jesus can do any thing for me...(x4)
2. You may see a mountain
you may see a wall
or maybe it's a giant storm that is crushing down your way
so you widen up your eyes
searching for survival dig into the bible
and here's what you see inside
just like years ago
the disciples were rowing on a boat
travelling through the ocean
and they called on to Jesus
when the waters was blowing
 and he showed them the impossible
CHORUS
Jesus stops the storm
Jesus stops the storm
Jesus can do any thing for me...(x4)
BRIDGE
Oh oh oh
he can do anything
he can do anything (x7)
solo
there's nothing that's difficult for God
he can do anything
he can do anything
repeat chorus together with the bridge
oh oh oh
he can do anything
he can do anything
