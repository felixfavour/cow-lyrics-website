Sure To Remain
By The Suffers
Lyrics by Andrew James and Kam Franklin
The outline of your body’s been burning in my mind
Ever since I saw you, ever since you looked my way
And I’m already dreaming about you in my life
Ever since I saw you, ever since you walked my way
The way you make me feel
Is burning like a fire
That takes my breath away
I want your arms around me
I want you to hold me tight
I want to be the one you fall asleep thinking of at night
When the morning comes
The evening fades
The love we had is sure to remain
Is sure to remain
I knew I was lying
When I said that I didn’t want to stay here
Didn't want to be with you
Cuz I know I’ve been dreaming about in my life
Ever since I saw you, ever since you looked my way
