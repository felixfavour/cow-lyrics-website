I will come to You with praise in my mouth
I will worship at Your throne with thanksgiving
It's to you that I sing
Proclaiming You as King and giving glory
You are counselor and friend
The beginning and the end
You're the keeper of my heart
I will worship You in spirit and truth
I will lift up holy hands in Your presence
I'll rejoice and I'll sing
And bless Your wondrous name
And give You glory
You're my righteousness and joy
You're my savior and my Lord
You're the keeper of my heart
You are counselor and friend
The beginning and the end
You're the keeper of my heart
You're the keeper of my heart
