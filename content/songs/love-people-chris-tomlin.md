It drives out fear
It conquers hate
It never gives up
It's never too late
It don't see color, just sees heart
We need each other, it ain't that hard
It's four little letters, one little word
If we all did it better, be a lot less hurt if we
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin]
Love people, love people
We all need love, people
Underneath the surface everybody's the samе
Everything that could divide us
Can't we all sеt that aside and just
Love people, love people
We all need love, people
We didn't all come up the same way
But we're all in need of the same grace
On our own, we won't make it far
If we ain't together, we're falling apart
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin]
So love people, love people
We all need love, people
Underneath the surface everybody's the same
Everything that could divide us
Can't we all set that aside and just
Love people, love people
We all need love, people
