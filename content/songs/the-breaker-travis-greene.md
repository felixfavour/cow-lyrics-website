It may not feel good to me but it is good for me
To be broken by You
Will keep Your hand covering me
I'm free when I'm broken by You
My life is safer, when I get to the Breaker
Bring my mistakes, to the hand of the Maker
Who I am is hidden, behind who I fake to be
My life is safer, when I get to the Breaker
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
My deepest apologies for hiding the very thing
That needs to be broken by You
Won't leave me without perfect peace
I find when I'm broken by You, ayy
My life is safer, when I get to the Breaker
Bring my mistakes, to the hand of the Maker
Who I am is hidden, behind who I fake to be
My life is safer, when I get to the Breaker
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Get to the Breaker
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Break the shell of who I was
I'm safe here in Your love, oh-oh-oh
Break the shame of what I've done
I'm safe here in Your love, oh-oh-oh
Break the shell of who I was
I'm safe here in Your love, oh-oh-oh
Break the shame of what I've done, ayy
I'm safe here in Your love, oh-oh-oh-oh
My life is safer, when I get to the Breaker
Bring my mistakes, to the hand of the Maker
Who I am is hidden, ooh, behind who I fake to be
My life is safer, when I get to the Breaker
My (Oh-oh-oh)
Ooh (Oh-oh-oh)
My life is safer now (Oh-oh-oh)
Get to the Breaker (Oh-oh-oh)
Back to my Maker (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm safe in Your hands (Oh-oh-oh)
Won't deprive me now (Oh-oh-oh)
Yeah yeah (Oh-oh-oh)
It may not feel good to me but it is good for me
To be broken by You
