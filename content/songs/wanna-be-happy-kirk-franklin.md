[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
The truth can hurt you
Or the truth can change you
What would truth do to you
I just wanna be happy
But if I keep on doing the things
That keep on bringing me pain
There's no one else I can blame
If I'm not happy
Wasted time but now I can see
The biggest enemy is me
So I'm not happy
[Pre-Chorus]
Cry yourself to sleep
Shout and raise your hands
It won't change a thing child
Until you understand
If you're tired of being the same
If you're tired of things not changing
It's time for you to get out the way
Don't get stuck in how you feel
Say "Jesus take the wheel"He knows the road that you need to take
(But it only works if)
