Behold the star of Bethlehem
The Word of God has become flesh
Unto us a child is born
The Savior of this broken world
Hear the angel voices
Sing come let us adore Him
Peace has come, for our King is with us
Fully God and fully man
He comes for all with open hands
He rules with love on David's throne
All praise belongs to Christ alone
Hear the angel voices
Sing come let us adore Him
Peace has come, for our King is with us
Holy, Holy, Holy
Jesus we adore thee
Peace has come, for our King is with us
[Bridge]
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Oh come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
