If my heart has grown cold, there Your love will unfold
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
When I'm blind to my way, there Your Spirit will pray
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
Oceans will part, nations come
At the whisper of Your call
Hope will rise, glory shown
In my life, Your will be done
Present suffering may pass, Lord, Your mercy will last
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
And my heart will find praise, I'll delight in Your way
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
Oceans will part, nations come
At the whisper of Your call
Hope will rise, glory shown
In my life, Your will be done
Oceans will part, nations come
At the whisper of Your call
Hope will rise, glory shown
In my life, Your will be done
