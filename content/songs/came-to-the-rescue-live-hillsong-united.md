Falling on my knees in worship
Giving all I am to seek your face
Lord, all I am is yours
[Pre-Chorus]
My whole life I place in your hands
God of mercy, humbled I bow down
In your presence, at your throne
I called, you answered
And you came to my rescue
And I want to be where you are
[Pre-Chorus]
My whole life I place in your hands
God of mercy, humbled I bow down
In your presence, at your throne
I called, you answered
And you came to my rescue
And I want to be where you are
I called, you answered
And you camе to my rescue
And I want to be whеre you are
