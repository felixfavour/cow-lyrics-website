The sun will shine
My heart shall sing
One thought of you Jesus
What joy it brings
My soul can't wait
To see your face
And I'll bless your name jesus
When we get there
You'll wipe my tears
You'll say well done
You'll hold me close
And tell me I've overcome
And you will exchange
Joy for my pain
And i'll bless your name jesus
When we get there
Come on lets go
We'll cry no more
We're gonna be just like jesus
When we get there
Come on lets go
*Hold on
It won't be long
We're gonna be just like Jesus
When we get there
