He loves me, even when I fall beneath His will
He loves me, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
He loves me, when my broken heart just won't keep still
He loves me, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
He loves me, even though He knew sometimes I'd fall
Yet and still my name He called
He loves me
Jesus I'm so grateful for Your love
He loves me, even though I was born in sin
He loves me, oh-oh-oh (
Oh
), oh-oh-oh (
Oh
), oh-oh-oh-ooh-ooh
He loves me
Took me like I was and now I'm free again
He loves me, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(
He loves me
)
He loves me, even though He knew that Keisha would fall
Yet and still my name He called
He loves me
(
Jesus I'm so grateful for Your love, love, love, love, love, love
)
Love (
Love, love, love, love, love, love
)
Love
[Outro: LaKeisha Grandy, 
Choir
]
He loves me
Fall beneath Your will but You love me
Ho-oh, ho-ho, ho-ho
You yet and still love me
This old broken heart just won't keep still
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, He loves me
Even though he knew sometimes I'd fall
He knew that I would fall but yet and still
Yet and still my name He called
My name He called, Jesus, I'm
Jesus, I'm so grateful for Your love
And nothing else could help
Jesus, I'm so grateful for Your love
Jesus loves the little children
Jesus, I'm so grateful for Your love
Oh, oh, oh
When nothing else could help, love lifted me
Love lifted me, love lifted me
When nothing else could help, love lifted me
