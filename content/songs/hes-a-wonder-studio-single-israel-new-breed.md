Miracles, miracles I have seen
What You can do with broken things like me
Mm-mm
And powerful, powerful You have been
Greater and stronger than my sin
Sing soul, I know
[Chorus: New Breed, 
Israel & New Breed
, (Chandler Moore)]
He's a wonder, He's a wonder (He is, He is a wonder)
He's a wonder, He's a wonder
He's a wonder in my soul
He's a wonder, He's a wonder (Yeah)
He's a wonder, He's a wonder (Yeah)
He's a wonder in my soul
[Interlude: Israel Houghton]
Yes, You are
Yes, You are
Yes, You arе
Beautiful, beautiful and nothing less
Onе view of You 
takes my breath away
I'm so amazed, oh, woah
