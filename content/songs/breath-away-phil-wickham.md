Your grace is an ocean with no end in sight
Your love is a fountain that never runs dry
Every morning, Your mercy is new
You're calling me closer, I fall into You
You have all my attention
And I give all my affection
What can I say
You've taken my breath away
Your glory is shining like stars in the night
I'm breathing Your presence with arms open wide
I'm lost in You, I'm finally found
Never been so free when You surround, when You surround
And You have all my attention
And I give all my affection
What can I say
You've taken my breath away
[Post-Chorus]
So in awe of all of Your goodness
I'm overcome, alive in Your presence
What can I say
You've taken my breath away
Oh, breath away
You've taken my breath away
Oh, breath away
