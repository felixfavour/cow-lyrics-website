When I'm at my end, You're just getting started
When I hit a wall, You just walk through
When I face a mountain, You are the Maker
So it's gotta move
When I'm out of faith, You are still faithful
When I'm at my worst, You are still good
In all of my questions, You are the answer
It all points to You
'Cause You're the God of the breakthrough
When I'm breaking down
You'll be working a way through
When there's no way out
This one thing I know, You're still on Your throne
So whatever I'm feeling
I've still got a reason to praise
Help me say
Praise, praise
Out of our wrongs, You write our story
And out of the cross, come rivers of grace
And out of the grave, bursts a revival no tomb can contain
'Cause You're the God of the breakthrough
When I'm breaking down
You'll be working a way through
When there's no way out
This one thing I know, You're still on Your throne
So whatever I'm feeling
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
When You come around
Dry bones come to life
Deserts to paradise
Stones just start rollin' away
When You come around
My heart starts to beat again
Lungs stretch to breathe You in
Souls just erupt into praise
When You come around
Dry bones come to life
Deserts to paradise
Stones just start rollin' away
When You come around
My heart starts to beat again
Lungs stretch to breathe You in
Souls just erupt into praise
'Cause You're the God of the breakthrough
When I'm breaking down
You'll be working a way through
When there's no way out
This one thing I know, You're still on Your throne
So whatever I'm feeling
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
'Cause You're the God of the breakthrough
When I'm breaking down
You'll be working a way through
When there's no way out
This one thing I know, You're still on Your throne
So whatever I'm feeling
I've still got a reason
To praise
Sing that with me, praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise (Every time you do, but you know)
Praise, praise (I'm not giving up on you)
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise (I've still got it)
I've still got a reason to praise (I've still got it)
You keep moving, You keep working
So I've still got it
I've still got a reason to praise
You keep moving, You keep working
So I've still got it
I've still got a reason to praise
You keep moving, You keep working
So I've still got it
I've still got a reason to praise
You keep speaking, You keep acting
I've still got it
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason to praise
Praise, praise
I've still got a reason
To praise
