Jesus is mine
He belongs to me
I'm certain He is good
I've tasted and seen
Jesus is mine
My heart is His home
No longer am I an orphan
He called me His own
I have an assurance
A knowledge divine
In all of Your glory
You are mine
Jesus is mine
I can rest at His feet
In perfect communion
In perfect peace
Jesus is mine
Like nothing that I've known
I'll hold to His garments
I'll never let go
