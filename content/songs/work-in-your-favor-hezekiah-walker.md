I know you been going through
And you don't know what to do
I see you're at the end of your rope
So hold on to your last ounce of hope
It's gonna work
Work in your favor
It's gonna work
Work in your Favor
Favor
I know you been going through
And you don't know what to do
I see you're at the end of your rope
So hold on to your last ounce of hope
It's gonna work
Work in your favor
It's gonna work
Work in your Favor
Favor
I know you're tired and feeling blue
Disgusted frustrated and angry too
But that's when you know you're so very close
So hold on to your last ounce of hope
It's gonna work
Work in your favor
It's gonna work
Work in your Favor
Favor

Favor
It's gonna work
Work in your favor
It's gonna work
Work in your favor
It's gonna work
Work in your favor
It's gonna work
Work in your Favor
