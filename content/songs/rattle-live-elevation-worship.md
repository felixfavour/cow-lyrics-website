Saturday was silent
Surely it was through
But since when has impossible
Ever stopped You
Friday’s disappointment
Is Sunday’s empty tomb
Since when has impossible
Ever stopped You
This is the sound
Of dry bones rattling
This is the praise
Make a dead man walk again
Open the grave
I'm coming out
I'm gonna live
Gonna live again
This is the sound
Of dry bones rattling
Pentecostal fire
Stirring something new
You're not gonna run out of miracles
Anytime soon
