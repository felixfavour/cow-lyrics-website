I see the face of the Father
I feel the love in His eyes
And everything in my heart knows that
I'm His joy and His pride
I feel the peace in His whisper
That His intentions are pure
And never have I felt more
Safe and secure
You said that You would never leave
And I know that You are here with me
You said that You would never leave, mm
And I know that You are here with me
Oh, it was late in the midnight
When You gave me a song
And then the sun came rising
And I sang all day long
Now I'm a testimony
Said I'm living proof
That what He did for me
He will do it for You, oh
You said that You would never leave (Oh, nah nah)
And I know that You are here with me (Yeah)
You said that You would never leave (Yeah) (Oh)
And I know that You are here with me
Whether I come or go
In Heaven or Hell below
You ain't going anywhere
You ain't going anywhere
Seasons come and seasons go
But one thing I know for sure
You ain't going anywhere (I know)
You ain't going anywhere (Yeah)
Whether I come or go
In Heaven or Hell below
You ain't going anywhere (No, no, no)
You ain't going anywhere (Oh, no)
Seasons come and seasons go
But one thing I know for sure
You ain't going anywhere (No, no)
You ain't going anywhere
Oh, You said that You would never leave (Oh)
And I know that You are here with me (Oh)
You said that You would never leave (Yeah, yeah) (Oh)
And I know that You are here with me (I know it, I know it, I know it oh)
Whether I come or go
In Heaven or Hell below
You ain't going anywhere (I know)
You ain't going anywhere
Seasons come and seasons go
But there's one thing I know for sure
You ain't going anywhere (You ain't going anywhere)
You ain't going anywhere (You ain't going anywhere)
You ain't going anywhere (You ain't going anywhere)
You ain't going anywhere (You ain't going anywhere)
You ain't going anywhere (You ain't going anywhere)
You ain't going anywhere (You ain't going anywhere)
You ain't going anywhere (You ain't going anywhere)
You ain't going anywhere (You ain't going anywhere)
You ain't going anywhere (You ain't going anywhere)
You ain't going anywhere (You ain't going anywhere)
You ain't going anywhere
Oh You said that You would never leave (No, no, no) (That's what You said)
I know that You are here with me (That's what I heard)
You said that You would never leave (Mm) (And I know it)
And I know that You are here with me (I know it, I know it, I know it)
