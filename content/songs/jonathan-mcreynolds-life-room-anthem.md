We'll have some fun tonight
We've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been giving God room with these life tunes
We just get too busy living and watching others live
That we forget the One who gave us life
So we've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been giving God room with these life tunes
We just get too busy living and watching others live
That we forget the One who gave us life
So we've been turning living rooms into life rooms
See, we've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been giving God room with these life tunes
We just get too busy living and watching others live
That we forget the One who gave us life
So we've been turning living rooms into life rooms
My self worth ain't determined by my net worth
'Cause God gave me a purpose on this earth
If I don't sell a lot of records, I ain't stressin'
I much rather go platinum in Heaven
See life is full a distractions
And we've become addicted to they temporary satisfaction
But yo, this ain't the end, there's another life after
So I work like a slave but I serve the right Master
Faster, time's ticking everyday
I'm tryna right my wrongs and do what the pastor say
Man, I was reborn; Christ wiped my past away
When you gon' finally make a change, when you pass away?
Yo, it all starts off by knowing one thing
We were only born to bring glory to our King
I was like an all-star on the losing team
God signed me as a free agent and now I'm winning [?]
We've been turning living rooms into life rooms
We've been giving God room with these life tunes
See, we just get too busy living and watching others live
That we forget the One who gave us life
So we've been turning living rooms into life rooms
