After all that we've been through
Tell me how I'm supposed to function without You
You've seen my heart be worn and used
You didn't leave, instead You stayed and made me new
[Chorus: Dante Bowe]
How sweet it is
To trust You, Jesus
To know You, I mean really know You
Father, Son
And holy Shepherd
A love so deep
It can't be measured
A love that's real
A love that's weathered
I could never count the times
You stayed faithful while my heart was compromised
You held mе close each time I criеd
When the last thing I deserved was sacrifice
[Chorus: Hannah McClure]
How sweet it is
To trust You, Jesus
To know You, I mean really know You
Father, Son
And holy Shepherd
A love so deep
It can't be measured
A love that's real, mm
A love that's weathered
