I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
There are no better words
to describe what you mean to me
There are no better ways
to express what i feel inside
Times I can't hold my self
The tears be rolling out
O how precious is
Your presence oh my God
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
