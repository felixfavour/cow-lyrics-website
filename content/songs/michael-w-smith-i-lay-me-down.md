Instruments
I have found him
love and mercy
from an infinite of supply
I have found him, living water
from a well that won't run dry
at your feet I bow in wonder
at your feet I place my crowns
Let surrender be the only sound
at your feet I lay me down
Fear and failure
Pride and hatred
you see all I try to hide
but sweet mercy, has embraced me
missing part
at your feet I bow in wonder
at your feet I place my crowns
Let surrender be the only sound
at your feet I lay me down
at your feet I bow in wonder
at your feet I place my crowns
Let surrender be the only sound
at your feet I lay me downnnnn
yeee eeeeee
into my emptiness you sit back and give me bread
I lay me down 2x
under my Holiness, take my all and nothing less
I lay me down 2x
At your feet I bow in wonder
At your feet I place my crowns
Let surrender be the only sound
At your feet I lay me down
