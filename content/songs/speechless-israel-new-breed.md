Unmerited, favor is mine
Unending but always
Unfailing, but never unkind
Undeserving
Refrain:
Oh but I receive Your
Chorus:
Grace, Lord your grace
Oh I need it, I receive it
I'm amazed, so amazed
When I see it, I am speechless
You take my breath away
You take my breath away
Wo ah repeat from top
Refrain:
Oh but I receive Your
I receive Your
Chorus:
Grace, Lord your grace
Oh I need it, I receive it
I'm amazed, so amazed
When I see it, I am speechless
Grace, Lord your grace
Oh I need it, I receive it
I'm amazed, so amazed
When I see it, I am speechless
You take my breath away
You take my breath away
Oh-woah-oh
You take my breath away
You take my breath away
Woah oh
