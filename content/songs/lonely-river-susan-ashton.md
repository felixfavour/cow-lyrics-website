Lonely river, you meander like a road
Stretching out into the great unknown
Solitary movement you're compell and you're inthrone
As though you're answering a distant call
Lonely river, is there a place you're running to
Or is it something that you're running from
Is it hope that keeps you going
Or is it faith that keeps you strong
Lonely river, lonely river, running home
Lonely river, in the stillness of the night
The restless nature keeps you raging on
Changing courses, shallow waters tending streams
Lonely river, do you wonder what it means
Lonely river, i think i am alot like you
Running home in hopes to find the sea
Flooded by uncertainties, the current can be strong
Drifting towards are destanies, the arm of god is strong
And i belive that through this journey until we're finally home
Lonely river, we will never run alone
