[Nathaniel Bassey]
One day I saw a door
Opened in heaven
Then I heard a voice
Like a trumpet sound
And He said to me, "Come on up higher""And behold the things that are yet to be"Then I beheld a sight of majestic beauty
All around the world, who is seated on the throne
The creatures and the four and twenty elders
Worshipping the One who lives forevermore
Singing
"Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy are you Lord""Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy are you Lord""Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy are you Lord""Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy are you Lord"Then I heard the cries
"Who is worthy to take the book and to open up the seal?""Worthy is the Lamb, Lion of Judah""He has prevailed and opened up the seal""Holy, holy, holy are you Lord""Holy, holy, holy are you Lord""Holy, holy, holy are you Lord""Holy, holy, holy are you Lord"
