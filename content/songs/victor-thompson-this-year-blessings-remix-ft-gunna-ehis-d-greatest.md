Everything I've been wanting
Manifesting for my life
Everything you've been wanting
Manifesting for your life
Everything I've been wanting
Manifesting for my life

Manifesting for your life
Oh-ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Yeah (La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da), yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
 8rae 'Lost Cause' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Genius...
This year, blessing
Money, testimony
Go, dey follow, follow

This year, good news
Jaiye, plenty balling
Go, dey follow, follow
Follow, follow, follow, follow

Everything I've been wanting
Manifesting for my life
Everything you've been wanting
Manifesting for your life
Everything you'vÐµ been wanting
Manifesting for your life
Everything you'vÐµ been wanting
Manifesting for your life
No stress, much less
Start from nothing (Nothing)
Life's hard, still blessed
A walking testimony (Walking testimony)
Feel lost, still blessed (Still blessed)
I stretch, touch the money (The money)
Can I follow, follow
Follow, follow, follow, follow
They say, "Young GunWunna is the G.O.A.T." (say, "Young GunWunna is the G.O.A.T.")
Planted me a seed and watched it grow
Travel overseas and cross the globe
Grinding to survive is all I know, oh (Oh)
Manifesting, reaching all my goals
Talked to God, it's out of my control
I will never, ever sell my soul, oh
Everything you've been wanting
Manifesting for your life
Everything you've been wanting
Manifesting for your life
Everything you've been wanting (La-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Manifesting for your life
Everything I've been wanting (La-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Manifesting for my life
Everything you've been wanting
Manifesting for your life
This year, blessings
Money, testimony
Go, dey follow, follow
Follow, follow
Follow, follow, follow, you dey go
This year, good news
Jaiye, plenty money
Go, dey follow, follow
Follow, follow
Follow, follow, follow you dey go
