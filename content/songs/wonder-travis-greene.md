[Intro: Travis Greene]
Alright
I’ve been through hurt
I’ve been through pain
Wish I had time, so I could explain
How God’s been good (Haha)
Oh, He made a way, yeah
Every time I was in trouble
Somehow, He won the battle
Now I know, it was nobody
Now I know (Hey), ot was nobody but You
[Chorus: Travis Greene]
When my soul looks back and wonder
Oh, how I made it over
When my soul looks back and wonder
Now I know it was nobody, uh
Nobody, but You
I’ve been through ups and downs
Doctor’s reports with no one around
But You’ve been there when I needed You most
(When I needed You most)
Every time I was in trouble
Somehow, You won the battle
Now I know it was nobody (It was nobody)
Now I know it was nobody but You
