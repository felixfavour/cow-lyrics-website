..
I saw my ashes.but u saw ur dream.
and saw and orphan u were my family.
I saw my freatly buh u saw might.
I saw my blindness. buh u were de light.
(chorus)
And u give me garments of priase.
fullness of joy.
unending mercy.
new every morning (2)
I saw de water.buh u saw de wine.
and i saw de branches buh u were de vein and i saw my weakness.buh u saw ur strength .
I saw my failure buh were enof.
(chorus) (2).
Cos I was lost till u called me up by name.
and I was dwn till u picked me up again.
 and i was rong till ur love had made me right.
I want dead till u sang me bck to life. (2)
(chorus) (2)
