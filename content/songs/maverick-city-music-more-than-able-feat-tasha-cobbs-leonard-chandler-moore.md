Why do I talk myself out of seeing miracles?
You are more than able
You are more than able
(You are, You are) you are more than able (Yeah)
(We've seen it) you are more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Now I see all that I have
Oh, I've got my confidence back
I put my trust in the One who still does miracles
You do miracles
You are more than able (hey)
(Say) you are more than able
(We know it) you are more than able
(We've seen it, we've seen it) you are more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Can you imagine
With all of the faith in the room
What the Lord can do?
What the Lord can do?
And it's gonna happen
Just let the way maker through
He's gonna move
He's gonna move
And can you imagine
With all of the faith in the room
What the Lord can do?
What the Lord can do?
And it's gonna happen
Just let the Way Maker through
He's gonna move
Yes, He's gonna move
And can you imagine
With all of the faith in the room
What the Lord can do?
What the Lord can do?
And it's gonna happen
Just let the Way Maker through
He's gonna move
He's gonna move
Anything is possible
(Sing it out)
Anything is possible
(I know)
Anything is possible
(C'mon)
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Anything is possible
(We've seen it)
Anything is possible
(So we believe it)
Anything is possible
(Hey)
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Anything is possible (Oh)
Anything is possible
(Anything)
Anything is possible
(Who am I?)
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do? (Hey)
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
(Oh) You are more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
I've come a long way
I've seen how You work
There's so much goodness and grace
Much more than I deserve
'Cause I know who l am
And I can't stay where I'm at
We've come this far by faith
And I just can't turn back
'Cause He's not done with me yet
He's not done with me yet
There's so much more to the story
You're not done with me yet
You're not done with me yet
You're not done with me yet
There's so much more to the story (C'mon)
You're not done with me yet (Say)
You're not done with me yet (After this there will be glory)
You're not done with me yet (After this there will be glory)
There's so much more to the story (After this there will be glory)
You're not done with me yet
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
God is more than able
God is more than able
God is more than able
Don't stop believing right now
Don't quit believing right now
God is more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
(He still can do it)
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Just 'cause I haven't seen it in my lifetime
That doesn't mean He can't do it
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Just 'cause it's not on my resume
Or just 'cause I don't have it, doesn't mean He can't do it
Oh who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
He can still do miracles with nothing
All it takes is nothing
All it takes is nothing
He can do a miracle
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
