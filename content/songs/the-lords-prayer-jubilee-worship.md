[Intro]
Come on somebody, worship the Lord in this place
Open your mouth and worship
Father, we worship You
Oh God let Your kingdom come, let Your will be done
Our God who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Your holy name
Give us today our daily bread
Forgive us Lord as we forgive
Let Your kingdom come
Let Your will be done
On Earth as in Heaven
Let Your glory come
Shining like the sun
Your kingdom reigns
[Interlude]
Come on somebody worship the Lord in this place
Oh God let Your kingdom come
Oh-oh-ohh, yeah
Lead us not into temptation
Deliver us from the evil one
Remind our hearts You're always with us
We shall never be afraid
