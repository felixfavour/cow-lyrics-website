We are Your people O, God
Washed by the blood of the Lamb
Clothed in Your righteousness
And in Your favor we stand
We love exalting Your name
Lifting up holy hands
Praise to our mighty God
Jehovah, the Great I AM

Let there be joy in house of the Lord
Let there be praise to the God of our salvation
Let there be singing and shouting
Dancing in celebration
Children of Zion rejoice
Let there be joy in the house of the Lord
Let there be praise to the God of our salvation
Let there be singing and shouting
Dancing in celebration
Children of Zion, children of Zion
Children of Zion rejoice
