Thank You for saving me
Thank You for loving me
Too much to leave
You’re not just the God who saves
But You are the One that remains the same
Every high and low, You’ll stay always
I can count on You
Your Love is not temporary
Up and down, in and out
When it starts, it won’t stop
Your love will keep going
On and on and on
You are dependable, God
[Chorus: Travis Greene]
Thank You for saving me
Thank You for loving me (Too much)
Too much to leave
You’re not just the God who saves (So much)
But You are the One that remains the same (Every)
Every high and low, You’ll stay always (Always)
I can count on You
