Makosa Song and tone)
And I will not fear what no man can do
For the things You've done for me
I cannot tell it all
You've been my shield and my strength
Oh Lord
You gave me the victory
And You turn my life around
You've been so good
Oh so good to me
The Lord is My Light
And my salvation
And I will not fear what no man can do
The Lord is My Light
And my salvation
And I will not fear what no man can do
He leads me (He leads me)
He guides me (He guides me)
Protects me (Protects me)
He loves me (He loves me)
And I will not fear what no man can do
He leads me (He leads me)
He guides me (He guides me)
Protects me (Protects me)
He loves me (He loves me)
And I will not fear what no man can do
What no man can do
Give the Lord a shout of praise in this place
The Lord is My Light
And my salvation
And I will not fear what no man can do
The Lord is My Light
And my salvation
And I will not fear what no man can do
He leads me (He leads me)
He guides me (He guides me)
Protects me (Protects me)
He loves me (He loves me)
And I will not fear what no man can do
He leads me (He leads me)
He guides me (He guides me)
Protects me (Protects me)
He loves me (He loves me)
And I will not fear what no man can do
What no man can do
