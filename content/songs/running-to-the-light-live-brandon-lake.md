You can have my yes, with no exception
I'm laying down my rights to second guessing
You can have my yes
I'm giving You my fear, of never knowing
Whatever's coming next, I know You've got me
You can have my yes, hey
You're the lamp, You're the light
You're the cloud that guides me
You're the way, You're the truth
You're the life inside me
You conquered my fears
So I leave it all behind
I'm running to thе light (Hey)
Running to the light
I'm giving You my dreams and my ambitions
'Causе Your presence is my prize and my provision
I'll answer when You ask (Hey)
Oh, who could come against if You are for me?
'Cause even in the fire, I know You've got me
I'm giving You my yes again
