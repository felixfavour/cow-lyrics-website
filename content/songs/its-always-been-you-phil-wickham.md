You saw me first
And You let me in when I was at my worst
The moment when I heard You say my name
It's the first time in so long I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid
You are the voice that calms the storm inside me
Castle walls that stand around me
All this time, my guardian was You
You are the light that shines in every tunnel
There in the past, You'll be there tomorrow
All my life, Your love was breaking through
[Post-Chorus]
It's always been You
It's always been You
My northern star
Your love will be the compass of my heart
Oh, I just wanna be right wherе You are
Right where You arе
And You are the voice that calms the storm inside me
Castle walls that stand around me
All this time, my guardian was You
And You are the light that shines in every tunnel
There in the past, You'll be there tomorrow
All my life, Your love was breaking through
