"I Lift Your Name Up"
I come to You
With a grateful heart
For the things You've done
I come to You
Giving all my praise
For this day You've made
You're amazing
Forever reigning, my God
There's no one like You
None beside You, my God
Everywhere I go
I will lift Your name up
In all I do
I will give You praise
Everywhere I go
I will lift Your name up
I'll lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
I come to You
With a sacrifice
Lord to lift You high
I come to You
Every night and day
Lord to give You praise
You're amazing
Forever reigning, my God
There's no one like You
None beside You, my God
Everywhere I go
I will lift Your name up
In all I do
I will give You praise
Everywhere I go
I will lift Your name up
I'll lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
Whatever comes my way
I will lift You up
Giving You my praise
I will never stop
You're surrounding me
Your love overflows
I will lift Your name
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
I will lift Your name up
In all I do
I will give You praise
Everywhere I go
I will lift Your name up
I'll lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
I lift Your name up
Whatever comes my way
I will lift You up
Giving You my praise
I will never stop
You're surrounding me
Your love overflows
I will lift Your name
Everywhere I go
