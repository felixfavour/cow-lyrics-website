I give You glory
For all You've brought me through
And now I’m ready
For whatever You wanna do
I'm moving forward
To follow after You
And now I'm ready
For whatever You wanna do
Your presence is an open door
We want You, Lord, like never before
Your presence is an open door
So come now, Lord, like never before
In every season
Your grace has been enough
And I’m believing
The best is yet to come
The cross before me
My hope on things above
And in You, Jesus
The best is yet to come
