Verse 1
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
Chorus
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
Verse 2
The prodigal is welcomed home
The sinner now a saint
For the God who died came back to life
And everything has changed
 
Pre Chorus
Oh death where is your sting
Oh fear where is your power
The mighty King of Kings has disarmed you
Delivered and redeemed
Eternal life is ours
Oh praise His name forever
Chorus 2
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
And all throughout eternity our song will be the same
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
Verse 3
On the day You call me in to Heaven's sweet embrace
I'll see Your scars, Your open arms, the beauty of Your face
Through tears of joy I'll lift my voice in everlasting praise
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
