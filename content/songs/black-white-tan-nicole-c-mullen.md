Momma looks like coffee, Daddy looks like cream
Baby is a mocha drop American dream
All the colors of the rainbow are in her family tree
Woven all together in a paisley tapestry
She holds real tightly to her parents' hands
Baby loves that woman, baby loves that man
And her soul gives a smile 'cause she understands
That love is black, white, tan
Yeah, yeah, yeah black, white, tan
Everyone is precious in the Father's sight
It don't matter red or yellow, black or white
He just loves ya 'cause He loves ya
I tell you this is true
You are not a color and a color is not you
So hold real tightly to your Daddy's hands
'Cause he loves that woman, He loves that man
And let your soul smile give a smile 'cause you understand
