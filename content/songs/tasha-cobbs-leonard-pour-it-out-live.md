Heavens rise upon your broken worship
Pour it out..... pour it out....
Jesus knows just how much it cost you....
Pour it out..... pour it out
He is here .....drawing  near ,  he is near to the broken hearted
He is here.....ooohh he is here
  Pour it ouuut ...pour it out
If its fear that keeps you from trusting
Pour it out... pour it out
If it's pride that keeps you from breaking
Pour it out...pour it out
He is near... drawing  near
He is near to the broken hearted.
He is here.... always here
Pour it out
Pour it out
Oooooohoo ooooohho *8
The fathers love will never leave you empty just pour it out... just pour it out
Just make room for all he is bringing
He is pouring out ..... he is pouring out
Oooohooo ooohhhho .... just pour it out
Oooho oooho....
Ohhho oooho
Oohhhho oooho
Ooohhhho
Tasha
