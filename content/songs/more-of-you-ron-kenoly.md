O Holy One
You have shown us
Your works and Your ways
But now we come before Your throne
Seeking Your face
[Pre-Chorus]
To know You from a distance
Just can't satisfy
This longing of our hearts
O Lord for
Oh Lord for more of You
More of You
Living water holy fire
Our one desire is more
More of You
More of You
Nothing else will satisfy
O Lord hear our cry
For more of You
Your sacrifice gives us life
And wisdom in Your grace
Now Your voice says come
So now we run
To Your embrace
