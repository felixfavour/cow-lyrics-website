 The One lyrics
 Father of mercy and grace
Your love have captured my heart Lover of my soul
You are everything Everything
that I've done Everything
that I have Is only by Your grace
 Cause You are backing me up
 I'm so glad
You've been there for me
 I'm so glad You are loving me
 You put the spotlight on me Now
 I'm burning for You
You are the one Who made my life so beautiful I can't stop singing Cause You've turned my life around
You are the one Who made my life so colorful I can't stop singing Cause You've made my world go round
 You are the one Who made my life so beautiful I can't stop singing Cause You've turned my life around
 You are the one Who made my life so colorful
I can't stop singing Cause You've made my world go round
You are the one You are the one You are the one Who made my life so beautiful
You are the one
You are the one You are the one
Who made my life so beautiful
Looking at where I'm coming from Looking at where I used to be Lord
 I'm convinced Your grace has brought me this far Certainly it's not by power
Certainly it's not by might
 The miracles I see It can only be You
I'm so glad You've been there for me
I'm so glad You've been there for me (there for me)
