We serve a God of miracles
Nothing's too hard for Him
Everything is possible
Anything is possible
Nothing's impossible
Let's say
Anything is possible
You're the God of miracles
Everything we speak
By faith we're gonna see
There is nothing You can't do
Every word You say is true
Lord You've never failed
Your people will prevail
We're not afraid of giants
Because they always fall
Lord we know You hear us
Every time we call
Shout if you believe it
'Til every wall comes down
Shout because you know that
Nothing's impossible
Shout if you believe it
'Til every wall comes down
Shout because you know that
Nothing's impossible
All our fear has gone away
Every day we walk by faith
We have overcome
We have already won
You've given us the victory
You've supplied our every need
We've got history
That's why we still believe
We can speak to mountains
And they have to move
Power and authority
Comes from You
Shout if you believe it
'Til every wall comes down
Shout because you know that
Nothing's impossible
Shout if you believe it
'Til every wall comes down
Shout because you know that
Nothing's impossible
We're not afraid of famine
You always will provide
Who can stand against us
When You're on our side
Shout if you believe it
'Til every wall comes down
Shout because you know that
Nothing's impossible
Shout if you believe it
'Til every wall comes down
Shout because you know that
Nothing's impossible
Nothing's impossible
All things are possible
He's still working miracles
It's happening now
Nothing's impossible
All things are possible
He's still working miracles
It's happening now
Nothing's impossible
All things are possible
He's still working miracles
It's happening now
Nothing's impossible
All things are possible
He's still working miracles
It's happening now
Nothing's impossible
All things are possible
He's still working miracles
It's happening now
Nothing's impossible
All things are possible
He's still working miracles
It's happening now
Nothing's impossible
All things are possible
He's still working miracles
It's happening now
Nothing's impossible
All things are possible
He's still working miracles
It's happening now
