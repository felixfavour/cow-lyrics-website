Looked around and suddenly realized
That You've been so good to me
Your mercy is everlasting, un-denying and overwhelming
Who am that you are mindful of?
Who am I that You pick my calls when I call you?
Who am that you're so mindful of?
Who am I that You hear my cry?
The source of my strength
(Na You)
The Strength of my life
(Na You)
My Hope and my Joy
(Na You)
My Confidence
(Na You)
You are the Source of my strength
(Na You)
You're the Strength of my life

You're my Hope and my Joy
