Verse 1
(Vashawn & Keneiloe)
In case you have fallen by the wayside of life
Dreams and visions shattered,
You are broken inside
You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in
The potter wants to put you back together again.
In case your situation has turned upside down
And all that you've accomplished
Is now on the ground
You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in
The potter wants to put you back together again.
Oh, the potter wants
To put you back together again.
(Vashawn)
In case you have fallen by the wayside of life
Dreams and visions shattered,
You are broken inside
You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in
The potter wants to put you back together again.
(Keneiloe)
In case your situation has turned upside down
And all that you've accomplished
Is now on the ground
You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in
The potter wants to put you back together again.
Oh, the potter wants
To put you back together again.
(Choir)
