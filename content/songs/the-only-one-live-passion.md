I believe every heart needs a healer
Someone to walk through the fire
All I need, I have found
Everyone is looking for a savior
When it feels like the worlds going under
All I need, I have found
In my life, Jesus
More of you, Jesus
You are the one, you are the one
In everything, Jesus
My heart sings, Jesus
You are the one, you are the only one
Everyday there's a hope to remember
Yesterdays been washed in the water
All I need I have found
In my life, Jesus
More of you, Jesus
You are the one, you are the one
In everything, Jesus
My heart sings, Jesus
You are the one, you are the only one
I believe ever heart needs a healer
Someone to walk through the fire
