[Chorus]
Risen, He's risen
Forever glorified
Risen, He's risen
King Jesus, King Jesus is alive
Grave where are you now
You've been overpowered
Death where is your sting
Conquered by the King
Resurrected One
Shining like the sun
Breaking through the fear
Victory is here, victory is here now
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, hallelujah
Jesus be lifted higher
We serve a risen Savior
[Bridge]
Same power; same power
That crushed the enemy
Same power; same power
Same power lives in me
