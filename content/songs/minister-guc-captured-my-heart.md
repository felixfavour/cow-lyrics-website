There's no day that you don't show me love
There's no day that you don't help me out
You have promised that you won't let me down
And Yes you are real, i'm not dreaming
You are the one for me my Love
I've see you heal, i'm not dreaming
You are the one for me my Love
[Pre-Chorus]
Yes you are real, you are so real
You are the one for me my love
We've seen you heal over again
We trust you're doing more today
We've seen you lift over again
Over again Over Again eh eh
