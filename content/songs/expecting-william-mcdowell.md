I’m expecting
Anticipating
A Move of God
A Move of God
[Repeat]
I’m expecting
Anticipating
A Move of God
A Move of God
We won’t be satisfied
Heaven invades our lives
Move oh God
Move oh God
[Bridge:]
And we’ll see
Blind Eyes Opened
Cities and regions changed
I Believe
We will see a move of God
[Sopranoes:] A move of God [repeat]
[Altos + Tenors:] We’ve been praying for it. We’ve been longing for it
We believe we’ll see (A Move of God)
