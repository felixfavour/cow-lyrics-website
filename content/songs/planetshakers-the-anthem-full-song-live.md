By his stripes, we are healed
By his nail-pierced hands, we're free
By his blood, we're washed clean
Now we have the victory
The power of sin is broken
Jesus overcame it all
He has won our freedom
Jesus has won it all
Hallelujah, you have won the victory
Hallelujah, you have won it all for me
Death could not hold you down
You are the risen king
Seated in majesty
You are the risen king
 nOur God is risen, he is alive
He won the victory, he reigns on high
