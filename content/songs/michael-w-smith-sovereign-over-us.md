There is strength within the sorrow
there is beauty in our tears
And you meet us in our mourning
 with a love that cast out fear
you are working in the waiting
you're sanctifying us
when beyond our understanding
you're teaching us to trust
Your plans are still to prosper
you have not forgotten us
you're with us in the fire and the flood
you're faithful forever
perfect in love
you are sovereign over us
You are wisdom unimagined
who could understand your ways
you reign in high above the heavens
reaching down in endless grace
you're the lifter of the lowly
in compassion and in kind
you surround and you uphold me
and your promises are my delight
your plans are still to prosper
you have not forgotten us
you're with us in the fire and the flood
you're faithful forever
perfect in love
you are sovereign over us
Even what the enemy means for evil
you turn it for our good 2
for your glory
even in the valley you are faithful
you're working for our good 2
for your glory
