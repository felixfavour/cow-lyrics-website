I find myself looking at you
A stranger I thought I knew
Harsh words came like a dart
Sharp arrows pierced my heart
Then I said some things out of spite
And so I should apologize
And now I ask you please
If you could forgive me
And let's start over again
Let’s start where we began
Back when time made us younger
We love much stronger
And every road led us to me and you
Rome wasn't built over night
Our love's gon’ take some time
Until what we have drеamed
Is our reality
And let's start ovеr again
Let's start where we began
Back when time made us younger
We love much stronger
And every road led us to me and you
