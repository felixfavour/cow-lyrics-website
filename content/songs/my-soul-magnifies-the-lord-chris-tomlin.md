Good news of great joy
For every woman, every man
This will be a sign to you
A baby born in Bethlehem
Come and worship
Do not be afraid
A company of angels
Glory in the highest
And on the earth peace among
Those of whom His favor rests

My soul, my soul magnifies the Lord
My soul magnifies the Lord
He has done great things for me
Great things for me
Unto you a child is born
Unto us a Son is given
Let every heart prepare His throne
And every nation under Heaven
