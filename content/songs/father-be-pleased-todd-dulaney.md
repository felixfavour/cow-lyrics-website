I search for Your approval
Whatever makes You smile
I live for You
I love it when You're happy
I love it when You're proud, oh God
I live for You
You're my heart's desire
You're my one desire, yes
So Father be pleased with me
Father be pleased with me
Father be pleased with me
You're my heart's desire
Right here in this moment
With every breath, I breathe
I live for You
Let nothing come between us
And this sacrifice I bring
'Cause I live for You
