When the song is over
When the music stops
Do you know Jesus
Does He live in your heart
When your life is troubled
Jesus still wants to be a part
Do you know Jesus
Does He live in your heart
Do you believe that He was born
Do you believe that He died
Do you believe your sins can be forgiven by the blood from His side
Do you believe His love can reach you right where you are
Do you know Jesus
Does He live in your heart, oh
Do you know Jesus
Does He live in your heart
Confess Him with your mouth
Believe Him in your heart
Do you know Jesus
You can know Jesus in your heart [x4]
It's so good to know Jesus [x10]
Do you know Jesus
Does he live in your heart, oh
You can know Jesus
He can live in your heart, oh
You can know Jesus
He can live in your heart, oh
You can know Jesus
He can live in your heart, oh
You can know Jesus
He can live in your heart
