[Instrumental]
Oh Lord, would You come close
Everything else can wait
I am here for You alone
This is the time and place
Don't be far from me
I'm here waiting on You
God, I'm not moving
I'm here waiting on You
Oh Lord, when You draw near
Everything else will fade
Distractions disappear
Fear has been swept away
So here I am with lifted hands
I'm crying out to You again
Don't be far from me
I'm here waiting on You
God, I'm not moving
I'm here waiting...
