You work in signs and wonders
Your voice is light and thunder
Your glory burns in every star
You flood the earth with beauty
I see You all around me
Oh God how wonderful You are, so I...
Fall down with a million saints
Lift up my hands and say
You're holy, holy
Join in with the ancient song
Heaven and Earth respond
You're holy, holy
Your heart for every nation
Reaches through generations
You called each prodigal Your child
You bridged the greatest distance
To grace us with Your presence
And draw the sinner to Your side, and I can't help but...
Fall down with a million saints
Lift up my hands and say
You're holy, holy
Join in with the ancient song
Heaven and Earth respond
You're holy, holy
