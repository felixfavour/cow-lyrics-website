Hide me now
Under Your wings
Cover me
Within Your mighty hand
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father, You are King over the flood
I will be still, know You are God
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
And know His power
In quietness and trust
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
Father, You are King over the flood
I will be still, know You are God
I will be still, know You are God
