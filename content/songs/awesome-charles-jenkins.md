My God is awesome, He can move mountains
Keep me in the valley, hide me from the rain
My God is awesome, heals me when I'm broken
Strength where I've been weakened, forever He will reign

My God is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome
My God is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome

My God is awesome, Savior of the whole world
Giver of salvation, by His stripes I am healed
My God is awesome, today I am forgiven
His grace is why I'm living, praise His holy name

He's mighty, He's mighty, He's mighty, He's mighty, Awesome, awesome
He's Holy... Awesome...
He's Great... Awesome...
He's mighty... Awesome...

Deliverer... Awesome...
He's holy... Awesome...
Provider... Awesome...
Protector... Awesome...
