The tide is turning
This is redemption's hour
In the midst of the world lost for love
You are all we have now
The lost returning
Salvation is all around
In the midst of the world broken down
You are all we have now
[Pre-Chorus 1]
For You are God and this hope is ours
So Father, open the skies
Flood the Earth with your light
This is love, to break a world indifferent
Our hearts are burning
The fire that won't burn out
In the midst of a world that's grown cold
You are all we have now
The earth resounding
The anthem of Your renown
As we lift up our eyes
And look to Your glory
