I've seen Your grace from the mountain
I've felt You there in the valley below
I see Your love and Your mercy
Guiding me home
I know You're in every season
I feel Your hand bringing peace and control
Jesus, Your love is my anchor
You're my only hope
You're my only hope
[Pre-Chorus]
I will trust in You
I will not be moved
High on the mountain
I will be lifting my voice
And in the valley
I will be dancing for joy
In every season
You are worthy
In every moment
You're wonderful
You're wonderful
