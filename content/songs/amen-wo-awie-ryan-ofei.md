You know what I will ask
Even before my needs
You are working on my behalf
At times when I cannot see
Your hand's been guiding me throughout
This journey
Now you're preparing a table before me
To sit and eat in the presence of my enemies
Woawie, Woawie
Amen, Woawie
Asɛm a Wokaaeɛ no
Bɔhyɛ a Wohyɛɛ me no
Amen, Woawie
So I'd rather give it to You than stand still in worry
A dying mother who's sick, her son is hurting
You are present and able, I'm certain (yeah)
Your blood was shed and You tore through the curtain
Of unbelief, so I could sing, say!
Woawie (Woawie)
Woawie (Amen)
Amen (Woawie)
Woawie (Asɛm a Wokaaeɛ no)
Asɛm a Wokaaeɛ no (yeah)
Bɔhyɛ a Wohyɛɛ me no (oh, yeah)
Amen (Woawie)
Woawie (say it again, Woawie)
