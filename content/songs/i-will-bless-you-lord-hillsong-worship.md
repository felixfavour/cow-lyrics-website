I trust in You my faithful Lord
How perfect is Your love
You answer me before I call
My hope my strength my song
[Pre-Chorus]
And I shout for joy I thank You Lord
Your plan stands firm forever
And Your praise will be continually
Pouring from my heart
I will bless You Lord
I will bless You Lord
How my soul cries out for You my God
I will bless You Lord
[Ending]
How my soul cries out for You my God
I will bless You Lord
