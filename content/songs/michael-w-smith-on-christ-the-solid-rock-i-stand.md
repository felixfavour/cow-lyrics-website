My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
When He shall come with trumpet sound
O may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
On Christ, the solid rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
