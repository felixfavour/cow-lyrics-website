Can we make just one big choir?
 (Yes)
And you know in choirs, we gotta rock
Y'all ready to rock? Let's go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (
That's nice, sing it again
)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (
Tenors, sing it
)
That's how He works, that's how, the Good Lord, He works (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
That's how He works, that's how, the Good Lord, He works (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Everybody put your hand on it, bounce
That's how the Good Lord works
That's how the Good Lord works
That's how the Good Lord works
That's how He works
That's how the Good Lord works
That's how the Good Lord works
That's how the Good Lord works
That's how He works
We must not question the Good Lord
Have faith in God and trust his word
We don't know how, we don't know when
To see this day, so we should stand
