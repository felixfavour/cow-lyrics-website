Standing in our presence
Lord, my heart and life are changed
Just to love You and to live to
See Your beauty and Your grace
Heaven and earth cry out Your name
Nations rise up and seek Your face
And Your Kingdom is established
As I live to know You more
(Chorus)
Now I will never be the same
Spirit of God, my life You've changed
And I'll forever sing Your praise
I live to know You, Lord (x2)
You've called me, I will follow
Your will for me I'm sure
Let Your heart beat feel my heart's cry
Let me live to serve Your call
Heaven and earth cry out Your name
Nations rise up and seek Your face
And Your Kingdom is established
As I live to know You more
