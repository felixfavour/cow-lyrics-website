In Genesis
There was darkness upon the face of the deep
And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters
The spirit of God there is Ruach Elohim
He’s the blast of God
He’s the breath of God
He’s the wind of God
The Lord is that spirit
He is God, Ruach Elohim
And we welcome him here
Eeeeh
Ruach Elohim
Ruach Elohim
Ruach Elohim
Ruach Elohim
Ruach Elohim
Ruach Elohim, Fill this Place
Ruach Elohim
Ruach Elohim
Ruach Elohim, ooh
Spirit of the Lord, eeh
Ruach Elohim
Ruach Elohim, Fill this Place
Fill this temple
Fill this people
Fill this atmosphere
