Blessed are those who run to Him
Who place their hope and confidence
In Jesus
He won't forsake them
Blessed are those who seek His face
Who bend their knee and fix their gaze
On Jesus
They won't be shaken
Come on and praise the Lord with me
Sing if you love His name
Come on and lift your voice with me
He's worthy of all our praise
Come on and bring your offering
Sing if you've known His grace
Come on and lift up your holy hands
Hе's worthy of all our praise
Blessed arе those who walk with Him
Whose hearts are set on pilgrimage with Jesus
They'll see His glory
Blessed are those who die to live
Whose joy it is to give it all for Jesus
And for Him only
Oh Jesus
All for Your glory
