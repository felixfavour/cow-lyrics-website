In the beginning
You were before creation
The source and the center
Jesus our sure foundation
In the beginning
You were before creation
The source and the center
Jesus our sure foundation
You hold it all together
And I was made by You
And I was made for You
And I was made to worship You
You hold it all together
Word of the Father
Came to this world so humbly
Now we're reconciled
By His blood and suffering
You hold it all together
You hold it all together
And I was made by You
And I was made for You
And I was made to worship You
You hold it all
