You still love me in spite of me?
You still chose me, how can it be?
Every scar, every flaw
You see it all, you see it all
You still love me, love me
Yeah, in spite of me
In spite of me
I don't cross every teeth
I don't doubt every eye
I got more flaws than a little
And I messed up a thousand times
I don't always commit
Sometimes I give up way too quick
And then I get tired of trying
To run away from who I am to who I want to be
Somedays are better than others
I can be up then I'm down
But beyond my mistakes
I'm found in your grace
And this one thing will never change
You still love me in spite of me?
You still chose me, how can it be?
Every scar, every flaw
You see it all, you see it all
You still love me, love me
Oh, in spite of me
In spite of me
I'm stubborn at heart
Quick to put up a guard
Do it all by myself
I won't ask for help
But sometimes my mouth is smart
I can be insecure
Counting other people's blessings
I never stop to notice what I got
Somedays are better than others
I can be up then I'm down
But beyond my mistakes
I'm found in your grace
And this one thing will never change
You still love me in spite of me?
You still chose me, how can it be?
Every scar, every flaw
You see it all, you see it all
You still love me, love me
You still love me in spite of me?
You still chose me, how can it be?
Every scar, every flaw
You see it all, you see it all
You still love me, love me
Let me hear you say yeah (yeah)
Can I get a witness? (yeah)
You didn't give me what I deserve (yeah)
Love so relentless (yeah)
Got me singing Hallelujah (yeah)
Can I get a witness? (yeah)
You didn't give what I deserve (yeah)
Love so relentless (yeah)
Got me singing
You still love me in spite of me?
You still chose me, how can it be?
Every scar, every flaw
You see it all, you see it all
You still love me, love me
