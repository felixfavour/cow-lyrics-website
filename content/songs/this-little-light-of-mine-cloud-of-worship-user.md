This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Oh, this little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
Hide it under a bushel, no!
I'm gonna let it shine
Hide it under a bushel, no!
I'm gonna let it shine
Oh, hide it under a bushel, no!
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
Don't let Satan blow it out (blow it out)
I'm gonna let it shine
No, I'm not gonna let him blow it out (blow it out)
I'm gonna let it shine, yes I am! (Uh-huh)
Don't let Satan blow it out (blow it out)
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
Oh, this little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Yeah, this little light of mine
Well I'm gonna let it shine
Yeah, this little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Oh, let it shine, let it shine, yes let it shine (let it shine)
Let it shine all the time, let it shine (let it shine)
Let it shine, let it shine, just let it shine
This light of mine
I'll let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine (I'll let it shine)
This little light of mine
I'll let it shine (one more time)
This light of mine
I'll let it shine (gonna let it shine)
