God of Jacob, Great I Am
King of Angels, Son of Man
Voice of many waters, song of Heaven's throne
Louder than the thunder, make Your glory known
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hail, hail, Lion of Judah
Let the Lion roar
Hail, hail, Lion of Judah
Let the Lion roar
Hail, hail, Lion of Judah
Let the Lion roar
Hail, hail, Lion of Judah
Let the Lion roar
[Post-Chorus: Brandon Lake & 
Chris Brown
]
Roar (
Roar
)
Roar (
Roar
)
Roar
Pride of Zion, prophets spoke
Our Messiah, flesh and bone
You alone are worthy to open up the scroll
Like the lamb You suffered but the Lion has arose
