We Will Rise To take this Nation
We have come to take this land
We will rise
We have come to take a stand
We cry liberty and justice
We cry righteousness and peace
We cry freedom from oppression
We proclaim Thy Kingdom come
We have seen the promise and the power
We have seen his majesty and strength
In his name
In his name we overcome
We will see the coming of the kingdom
We will see the glory of his throne
We will rise
We will see his Kingdom come
