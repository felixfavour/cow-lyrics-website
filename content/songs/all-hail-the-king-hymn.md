All hail the power of Jesus’ Name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all,
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all.


Crown Him, ye martyrs of your God,
Who from His altar call;
Extol the Stem of Jesse’s Rod,
And crown Him Lord of all,
Extol the Stem of Jesse’s Rod,
And crown Him Lord of all.


Ye seed of Israel’s chosen race,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all,
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all.


Sinners, whose love can ne’er forget,
The wormwood and the gall,
Go spread your trophies at His feet,
And crown Him Lord of all,
Go spread your trophies at His feet,
And crown Him Lord of all.


Let ev’ry kindred, ev’ry tribe,
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all.


O that with yonder sacred throng,
We at His feet may fall,
We’ll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all.
We’ll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all!
