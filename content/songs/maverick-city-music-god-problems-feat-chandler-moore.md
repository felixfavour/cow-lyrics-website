Chandler
There are just some problems only God can fix
There will be some moments that just don't make sense
I've seen it happen time and time again
There are just problems only God can fix.
Naomi
There are just some battles flesh and blood can't win
There are just some moments that just don't make sense
I can't see it now but I'm still convinced
There are just some problems only God can fix
Not by power, not by might, by the spirit of the living, Spirit of the living God
Not my battle, not my fight, by the spirit of the living, spirit of the living God
Oh oh oh oh
I've seen a breakthrough that I can't explain, I've felt the healing, healing in my pain
I know a dead man that was rose from grave
I've seen some breakthroughs and I will again
Chorus
Not by power, not by might, by the spirit of the living, Spirit of the living God
Not my battle, not my fight, by the spirit of the living, spirit of the living God
By the spirit of the living, spirit of the living God
oh oh oh
Bridge
My fortress my refuge, still a strong tower, still a strong tower
My helper, defender, still a strong tower, still a strong tower
Oh oh oh someone let the people know anything is possible
 No weapon will prosper, still a strong tower, still a strong tower
My fortress my refuge, still a strong tower, still a strong tower
My helper, defender, still a strong tower, still a strong tower
Oh oh oh someone let the devil know, tell him that he's got to go
No weapon will prosper, still a strong tower, still a strong tower
Chorus
Not by power, not by might, by the spirit of the living, Spirit of the living God
Not my battle, not my fight, by the spirit of the living, spirit of the living God
By the spirit of the living, spirit of the living God
Bridge
My fortress my refuge, still a strong tower, still a strong tower

My fortress my refuge, still a strong tower, still a strong tower
My helper, defender, still a strong tower, still a strong tower

No weapon will prosper, still a strong tower, still a strong tower
Oh oh oh someone let the devil know, tell him that he got to go x3
No weapon will prosper, still a strong tower, still a strong tower
Oh oh oh oh
For the name of the Lord, yes the name of the Lord is still a strong tower, still a strong tower
For the name the lord is still a strong tower, still a string tower
I find my safety in him, still a strong tower, still a strong tower
I know where to go 2
I know where to hide x2
My hiding place is a still a strong tower
He's my hiding place, still a strong tower, still a strong tower x5 hiding place 3
He's my hiding place, hiding place
I know where to go, hiding place
I know where to run, hiding place
Chorus
Not by power, not by might, by the spirit of the living, Spirit of the living God
Not my battle, not my fight, by the spirit of the living, spirit of the living God
By the spirit of the living, spirit of the living God
You may have an incurable disease in the room, sounds like a God's problem
He can solve it
You may have something that you can't figure out in the room, sounds like a God problem
He can solve it
I've got a God problem, He can solve it, he's on it.
