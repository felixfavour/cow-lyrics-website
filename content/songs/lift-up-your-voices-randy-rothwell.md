Lift Up your voices, your tambourines
Sound the trumpet
Praise to the King
Sing a new song, let your faith arise
Join the triumph
He's glorified
Lift Up your voices, your tambourines
Sound the trumpet
Praise to the King
Sing a new song, let your faith arise
Join the triumph
He's glorified
Praise Him
Praise Him
All in one accord
Give him
Glory
Jesus Christ is Lord
Lift up your praise, let your voice be heard
Darkness flees
At sound of his Word
Join with a shout, let your songs proclaim
The strength and power
Of his mighty name
