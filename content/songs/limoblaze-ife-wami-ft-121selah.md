Let them know
oh no no no
your love is so much better
sweeter than any other
deeper than words can explain
your love dey burst my brain
when I go to the east and say (na)
when I go to the west and say (na)
them dey ask who be my provider
gege my Jah my lover
your love is sweeter than and even better I  know
they don't know I don't deserve this
failed you, you know I was watching
left you away for the perfect
why do you love me still
(ife wami o wami
oluwa Fife wami ) 4x
love wey confam o
God wey confam o
I tried to run u no let me go
you just dey hold me close
o my odo oo
you never leave my side you hold me tight like Romeo we meet Juliet o no no
nobody hold mind hold me
if no me say you dey for my side
i don't deserve this
failed you, you know I was watching
left you away for the perfect
why do you love me still
(ife wami o wami
oluwa Fife wami)4x
don't you know that your the only one that steady on my mind now
on my mind
