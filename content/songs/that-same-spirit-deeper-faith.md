Jesus said it is expedient for me to go away. But I'll send you another comforter, To guide you from day-to-day.

So they tarried at Jerusalem, For power from on high. That same spirit that they received, Within my heart abides.

I can feel his Holy Spirit,
A dwelling deep within. Well, sometimes it feels so gentle,
And sometimes like a mighty rushing wind. 

But, that same spirit that raised Jesus up from death and the grave, It shall raise this ole body up and take me home someday.

Oh, they laid him in an empty tomb, and they rolled a big ole' stone over the door. They put soldier there to guard it, you know they thought they'd done away with my Lord.

But on the third day the stone was rolled away and he came forth from the grave. That same spirit that raised Jesus up will take me home some day.

I can feel his Holy Spirit,
A dwelling deep within. Well, sometimes it feels so gentle,
And sometimes like a mighty rushing wind. 

But, that same spirit that raised Jesus up from death and the grave, It shall raise this ole body up and take me home someday.
