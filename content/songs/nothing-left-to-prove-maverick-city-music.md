I just want to thank You Jesus
A testimony of Your goodness
In the safety of Your presence
'Tis so sweet, 'tis to sweet
To only trust in Jesus
In the light and in the darkness
The overwhelming kindness
Follows me, follows me
[Chorus: Israel Houghton, Naomi Raine, Mav City Gospel Choir]
And You're still in the fire
Just in case we feel alone
Still walking on the water
You refuse to let us go
Singin', something 'bout the way you move, Jesus
Nothing left for you to prove, Jesus
I have a million reasons to trust what You are doing
And you're doing good things (good things, good things)
I have seen it in my family
I have seen it in thе streets
Oh I cannot shake Your mercy
Oh, it chases mе, it chases me
