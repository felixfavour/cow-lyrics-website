The weapon may be formed, but it won't prosper
When the darkness falls, it won't prevail
'Cause the God I serve knows only how to triumph
My God will never fail
Oh, my God will never fail
I'm gonna see a victory, I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You, Lord
I'm gonna see a victory, I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You, Lord
There's power in the mighty name of Jesus
Every war He wages, He will win
Oh, I'm not backing down from any giant
'Cause I know how this story ends
Yes, I know how this story ends
I'm gonna see a victory, I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You, Lord
I'm gonna see a victory, I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You, Lord
