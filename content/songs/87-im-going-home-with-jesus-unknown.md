I'm going home with Jesus in the twinkling of an eye. I've made my reservations for a mansion in the sky. I may not know the moment, I may not know the day, but I know that I'll be leaving when He calls His Church away!

I'm listening for the trumpet to sound most any time, and a crown of life that's waiting, thank God will soon be mine! I've got my invitation thru a place Calvary, by the precious blood of Jesus, the trip's been paid for me. 

I'm going home with Jesus in the twinkling of an eye. I've made my reservations for a mansion in the sky. I may not know the moment, I may not know the day, but I know that I'll be leaving when He calls His Church away!

The Captain of the vessel is calling; "Get on board," and the destination's Heaven, safe on that crystal shore. There we'll meet again the Saviour and our loved ones who have gone. Then we'll live through all eternity, thank God, we're going home. 

I'm going home with Jesus in the twinkling of an eye. I've made my reservations for a mansion in the sky. I may not know the moment, I may not know the day, but I know that I'll be leaving when He calls His Church away!

I know that I'll be leaving when He calls His church away!!!!
