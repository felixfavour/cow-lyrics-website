I'm not afraid to shine
['Cause Jesus?], You're the one who died
And when He thought of me
He got up with victory
He is the Chosen One
The righteous Son of God
So death where is your sting?
We got the victory
Jesus is alive
Alive, alive
And He lives in me
Alive, alive
And He lives in me
Alive, alive
And He lives in me
Alive, alive
And He lives in me
I'm not afraid to shine
['Cause Jesus?], You're the one who died
And when He thought of me
He got up with victory
He is the Chosen One
The righteous Son of God
So death where is your sting?
We got the victory
