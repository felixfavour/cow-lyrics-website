When the night is dark,
 fire you had has lost its spark
Take a little peace from God,
 take a little peace from God
Let it burn in your heart
When your land is dry
rain only falls from your eyes
Take a little peace from God
Take a little peace from God
And the river you'll find
It's yours for the taking,
so just take a little peace from God
It's yours for the making,
so just take a little peace from God
It's already given
so just take a little peace from God
He is right where you are
When your faith is weak
tossed by the waves of all you see
Take a little peace from God,
just a little peace from God
He has more than you need
It's yours for the taking,
 so just take a little peace from God
It's yours for the making,
so just take a little peace from God
It's already given to us,
so just take a little peace from God
He is right where you are
oh yea
It's yours for the taking,
so just take a little peace from God
(take a little)
It's yours for the making,
so just take a little peace from God
(com' on and take it)
It's already given to us,
so just take a little peace from God
He is right where you are
When the night is dark....
