Holy Holy Holy Holy
Lord God Almighty
Heaven and Earth shall declare your glory
Amen

And the angels cry, Holy
All creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy forever
Hear your people sing, Holy
To the King of Kings, Holy
You will always be, Holy
Holy forever

Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all

What a beautiful Name it is, what a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ, my King
What a beautiful Name it is, nothing compares to this
What a beautiful Name it is, the Name of Jesus

You have no rival, You have no equal
Now and forever, God, You reign
Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the Glory
Yours is the Name above all names

Your name is the highest
And the the Angels cry Holy.

Holy Holy are You Lord God
Almighty worthy is the lamb,
You are Holy Holy are You Lord God
Almighty Worthy is the lamb Amen.
