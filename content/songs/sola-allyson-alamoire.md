So this is alamoire. The song I received for you,for me, for all of us and more expecialily most expecially for you you you think nothing good you think there's nothing good about your life because of some things that has happened and they are suggested to you there's nothing good about your life so you care Just existing instead of fully living so I have come to deliver This message because of you From alamoire The molder of Good ire nikan lo mo that you are good that regardless the source From which originally you are good no matter what you have been called you are good alamoire ire nikan ni alamoire po Fi amo Mo mi omo mi ire
