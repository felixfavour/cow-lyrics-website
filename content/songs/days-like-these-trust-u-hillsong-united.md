The time will come
The night will shine like the noonday sun as the Earth wakes up
In a Heaven dream
And days like these
Will be left behind as we rub our eyes of this old world dust
In a different light
And the beauty of Your face
Will ignite my heart in awe, so unimagined
In all You are
And the skies will roar with praise
In the revelry of how You turned this wasteland
To paradise
Oh, lead us home
And turn our eyes from the whiplash daze of this wild unknown
Let us seek Your face
And plead the cross
As we dance upon what remains of death and the empty threat
From that empty grave
