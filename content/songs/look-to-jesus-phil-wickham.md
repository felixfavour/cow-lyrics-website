Death looks like an empty grave
Fear looks like a giant slain
Trials look like gifts of grace
When I look to Jesus
Failures bow to victory
Sin has lost its hold on me
In this love is all I see
When I look to Jesus
How my heart leaps
How my soul sings
For I know where my help comes from
Jesus sought me
Jesus saved me
Hallelujah
For all He's done
Yeah!
Every wall comes crashing down
Chains are broken on the ground
What can stand against us now
When we look to Jesus?
Yeah!
