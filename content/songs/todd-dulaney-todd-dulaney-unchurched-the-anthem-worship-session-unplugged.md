I wonder why they look at me strange
like i dont belong on this room
am tryna figure out if I'll stay
cause i dont feel welcome here
i know am not dressed like everyone else
And I don't own a pair of church shoes
But I'm here because I needed some help
I'm starting to think that i made a bad move
But if they give me the chance
I only want to make it to the altar to see the man
That's why I came today to change my ways
And I am not ashamed but they're pushing me away
I heard that church was the place to come for my healing
But somehow I cant see how that's so
Everyone seems to be so uneasy
Maybe its the way I look i'm unsure
If they give me the chance
I only want to make it to the altar to see the man
That's why I came today to change my ways
I am not ashamed
I don't care what they think of me
'Cause I'm were I belong
Right now I want to be set free
And find my heart a home
If they give me the chance
I only want to make it to the altar to see the man
Thats why I came today to change my ways
And I am not ashamed
ehhhh ehhh eehhhh
doesn't matter what you look like oh no
doesnt matter what u dress like
ehhh
God made me like this
God made me like this
God made me like this, this ehh
God made me like this
God made me like this, this
God made me like this(....)
hmmmm
unashamed of who i am in God
unashamed of who I am in God (4x)
