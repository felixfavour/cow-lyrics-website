A King is born this day in Bethlehem
Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!)
No crown is worn but angels worship Him
Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!)
Almighty God, He was meek and mild
Salvation comes through this holy Child
Chorus:
A King is born, (He is in the manger now)
A King is born, (humbly come and humbly bow)
A tiny Lord, (He's reaching out His tiny hand)
A King is born on this day, in Bethlehem
His palace is lowly, His throne is made of hay
Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!)
Shepherds bow down to see His holy face
Hallelujah! (Halle, hallelujah!)
Heaven is singing of peace on earth
Filled with the wonder of this birth
(Repeat Chorus)
Bridge:
Come humbly and humbly bow;
He's in the manger now
(Repeat 3 times)
