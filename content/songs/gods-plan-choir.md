God has a plan with you in mind, for you to be fruitful and multiply
He knows you ending, before your beginning
Don’t be dismayed, its only delayed
Its not only your time, but your turn
Its not only your time, but your turn

God has a plan with you in mind, for you to be fruitful and multiply
He knows you ending, before your beginning
Don’t be dismayed, its only delayed
Its not only your time, but your turn
Its not only your time, but your turn

God’s plan for you, shall come to pass
Just wait and see, you’ll be alright [2x]

Be fruitful, multiply
I speak blessings, on your life

I speak blessings [repeat as lady ad libs]
On your life

Multiply, multiply, multiply, multiply, multiply
Be fruitful and multiply
Its not only your time, but your turn
