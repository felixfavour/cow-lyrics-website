I thought the more I cleaned myself up
The more worthy I'd be
I thought I had to draw near to Him
For Him to draw back to me
But He's the breath in my lungs when I'm gasping for air
He's the friend listening, holding my desperate prayers
In every hour that felt too dark
In every moment He felt far
Every time I felt like He forgot
Didn't know I was closer to God
In every valley, He walked with me
He sealed my future, set me free
In every place I felt lost
Didn't know I was closer to God
'Cause He leans into the brokenhearted
The whisper in the storm
And looking back to where I started
The path revealed Him more
He's the tears in my eyes washing my soul
And I had to lose it to know He's in control
In every hour that felt too dark
In every moment He felt far
Every time I felt like He forgot
Didn't know I was closer to God
In every valley, He walked with me
He sealed my future, set me free
In every place I felt lost
Didn't know I was closer to God
I had to lose hope to finally stop runnin'
And I had to feel alone to learn that I wasn't
In every hour that felt too dark
In every moment He felt far
Every time I felt like He forgot
Didn't know I was closer to God
In every valley, He walked with me
He sealed my future, set me free
In every place I felt lost
Didn't know I was closer to God
He's the friend listening
Holding my desperate prayers
