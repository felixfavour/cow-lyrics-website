O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him, born the King of Angels
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord
Then the angel said to them
"Do not be afraid, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy
Which will be to all people
For there is born to you this day, in the city of David
A Savior, who is Christ, the Lord
[Hook]
And this will be a sign to you
You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger"And suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude
Of the Heavenly Host praising God
And saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men"
