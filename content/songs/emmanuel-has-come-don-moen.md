Christmas is about his glory
Christmas is about his grace
Christmas is a gift of love
Our Father gave us
More than just another story
About a special time and place
Christmas is a time to lift a song of praise
For God is with us
And we celebrate the Glory of His presence
Christ has come to fill our hearts with love
He came to save
King of kings and Lord of Lords His name is Jesus
God with us, Emmanuel has come
Angels fill the night with singing
God is reaching out to man
Bringing us a gift of hope
In Christ our Savior
More than just a time of giving
This is God's eternal plan
And Christmas is the reason
We can sing again
