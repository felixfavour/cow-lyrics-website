[Intro]
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
All who are thirsty
Come and drink the living water
Taste and see, taste and see
There is a river
Where power flows, healing the city
Miracles, miracles
[Pre-Chorus]
God is doing something that we've never seen before
Our God is moving, our God is healing
You can step into the waters and receive
There's a miracle for all who will believe
God is moving
All who are hungry
Drawing near, come to the table
God is here, God is here
All who are ready
(Oh) It's time to go, the water's rising
Overflow, overflow
