Yeah, I love this little house we got out on the edge of town
It's hard to think that we could beat the view we got right now
We think we got it good watching the sunset from the steps
It looks like Heaven, but we ain't seen nothing yet
[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & 
Chris Tomlin & Florida Georgia Line
]
When we get to our 
forever home
We'll see beauty like we've 
never known
Angels singing 
Hallelujah songs
Hard to imagine one day
All this gravel turned to 
streets of gold
Time goes by but we won't ever 
get old
It's a picture perfect place, I can't wait to see your face
When we get to our 
forever home
Me and you will be forever home
Yeah, we'll leave all of our worries, 
just like work boots on the porch
And all our loved ones they'll be hanging out, when we walk through the door
Yeah, we'll catch up on the good times and we'll have a million more
No, there ain't no telling what He's got in store
[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & 
Chris Tomlin & Florida Georgia Line
]
When we get to our 
forever home
We'll see beauty like we've 
never known
Angels singing 
Hallelujah songs
Hard to imagine one day
All this gravel turned to 
streets of gold
Time goes by but we won't ever 
get old
It's a picture perfect place, I can't wait to see your face
When we get to our 
forever home
Me and you will be forever home
