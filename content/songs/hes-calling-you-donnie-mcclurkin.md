He's calling you, He's calling you
Tell me what are you going to do?
Your time has come for a life brand new
He is calling you, He is calling you
There's a voice deep inside
You hear it and you cannot hide
Seems like after all you've tried
You never satisfied
You softly heard Him call and say
Promised that you'd change someday
Even if you run away, you still can't deny
Something's going on and it's real
Somehow deep inside you can feel
He's calling you, He's calling you
Tell me what are you going to do?
Your time has come for a life brand new
He is calling you, He is calling you
Remember when you said before
That you needed something more
Now it's time to realize, He's knocking at your door
Things that you used to do
Somehow don't appeal to you
