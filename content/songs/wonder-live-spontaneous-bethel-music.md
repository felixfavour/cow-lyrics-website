May we never lose our wonder
May we never lose our wonder
Wide-eyed and mystified
May we be just like a child
Staring at the beauty of the King
May we never lose our wonder
May we never lose our wonder
Wide-eyed and mystified
May we be just like a child
Staring at the beauty of our King
May we never lose our wonder
May we never lose our wonder
Wide-eyed and mystified
May we be just like a child
Staring at the beauty of our King
(Oooh, oh-ooooh, fill us with wonder)
May we never lose our wonder
May we never lose our wonder
Wide-eyed and mystified
May we be just like a child
Staring at the beauty of our King
'Cause You are beautiful in all Your ways
King of Kings
You are beautiful in all Your ways, oooh
'Cause You are beautiful in all Your ways
(Just close your eyes)
(Just close your eyes, you'll see Him)
You are beautiful in all Your ways
(Open the eyes of our heart to see You, God)
