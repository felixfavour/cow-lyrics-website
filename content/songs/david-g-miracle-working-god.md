Jehovah made the cripple work
He made the blind to see
He made the deaf to hear
He made the dead to rise
Jehovah made me smile again
He gave me joy again
He turned my life around o
He has changed my soul enough
so! when troubles come your way, don't too be afraid
when sorrow comes your way never run away
when sickness comes your way, don't you don't you ever fright
my God is a miracle working God/6 times
Jehovah lifts me up again
He makes me well again
He wipe my tears away
He healed my heart again o
Jehovah bless my life again
He bless my home again
Jehovah touched my life again
He makes me strong again
when troubles come your way, don't too be afraid
when sorrow comes your way never run away
when sickness comes your way, don't you don't you ever fright
my God is a miracle working God/6 times
