1 I’m calling on the God of Jacob
Whose love endures through generations
I know that You will keep Your covenant
I’m calling on the God of Moses
The one who opened up the ocean
I need You now to do the same thing for me
Chorus:
O God my God I need You
O God my God I need You now
How I need You now
O Rock O Rock of ages
I’m standing on Your faithfulness
2 I'm calling on the God of Mary
Whose favor rests upon the lowly
I know with You all things are possible
I'm calling on the God of David
Who made a shepherd boy courageous
I may not face Goliath
But I've got my own giants
Chorus:
O God my God I need You
O God my God I need You now
How I need You now
O Rock O Rock of ages
I’m standing on Your faithfulness
O God my God I need You
O God my God I need You now
How I need You now
O Rock O Rock of ages
I’m standing on Your faithfulness
