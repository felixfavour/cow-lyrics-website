[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
No matter what you're going through
I know that you can stand
For your life is in, in His hands
Listen
You don't have to worry
And don't you be afraid
Joy comes in the morning
Troubles, they don't last always
For there's a friend in Jesus (
Hallelujah
)
Who will wipe your tears away (
Yeah
)
And if your heart is broken
Just lift your hands and say
[Chorus: God's Property, 
Kirk Franklin
]
Oh, I know that I can make it
(
I know that I can stand
)
I know that I can stand
(
No matter what comes my way
)
No matter what may come my way
(
Jesus, my life
)
My life is in your hands
(
Let's sing it together, listen
)
