Lord if I could buy you a gift
To show you my love, tell you how I feel
It wouldn't matter what I have to give.
 I would find a way to get it for you.
But fortunately that's not the case and we both know I don't have a way and I won't let it affect my presentations to you. Cos this is what I bring, here is my heart, my mind lord here's my life. My everything take it, its yours oh lord.
I will give you my all, my everything, every song that I write , every song that I sing, everyday of my life, every breath that I breathe. You gave to me and lord I rededicate it right back to you. The love of my life, so faithful so true. I get goose bu mps just thinking about you there is nothing I will not do for you
Here is my heart, my mind, lord here's my life, my everything take it
Its urs oh lord, its all I have
Here is my heart, my mind, lord here's my life, everything take it
Its urs oh lord, its all I have to give
Here's my heart my mind, lord here's my life take it, its urs alone (twice)
I give you me best because I love you
Here is my heart, my mind, lord here's my life, my everything take it
Its urs o lord, its all I have
Here is my heart, my mind, lord here's my life, everything take it
Its urs alone, its all I have to give
