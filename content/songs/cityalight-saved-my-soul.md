You my God has saved my soul
I am yours forever more
I won't be moved of this am sure
You my God you save my soul
I was lost when you came for me
Held in chains by the enemy
But you broke then in Victory
Now am free I am free
your my joy and you are my hope
i am safe by your grace alone
i will sing of your love for me
I am free I am free
chorus
Now I stand with the king of kings
He has paid for my every sin
and from now till eternity
I am free  I am free
chorus
What once was dead is now alive
You gave to me the breath of life
You brought me up out from the grave*2
I am bursting out with songs of praise*2
chorus *2
