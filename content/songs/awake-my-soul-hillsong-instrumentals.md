There is a sound I love to hear
It's the sound of the Savior's robe
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear praises He hears faith
There is a sound I love to hear
It's the sound of the Savior's robe
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear worship He hears faith
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
There is a sound that changes things
The sound of His people on their knees
Oh wake up you slumbering
It's time to worship Him
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
