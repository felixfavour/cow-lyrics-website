It starts from holy
To hallelujah, then amen
That's the progression
We and the angels
In one accord, to the one
Who reigns on high
It starts from holy
To hallelujah, then amen
That's the progression
We and the angels
In one accord, to the one
Who reigns on high
Holy holy, hallelujah
Forever, amen
Holy holy, hallelujah
Forever, amen
Aya
Somebody lift your hands up high
Mimo mimo mimo mimo
It starts from holy
To hallelujah, then amen
That's the progression
We and the angels
In one accord, to thе one
Who reigns on high
It starts from holy
To hallelujah, thеn amen
That's the progression
We and the angels
In one accord, to the one
Who reigns on high
