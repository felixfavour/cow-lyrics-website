I'm the Lord,
I'll never let you Down
I'm the One, I'm the One
I'm the Lord,
I'll never let you Down
The Battle is Mine
I Already Won for you
The Fight on Date
Is yours for the Taking
You've got the Power
To Change the World
And you're Unstoppable
Go in my Name and Shine your Light
And you will Sing a Victory Song
Cause Victory is Already Yours
Do not fear, no, no

Cause I'm the One
Who Lifts you Up
When you need me,
Am already there
I'm the Lord, I'll never let you Down
I'm the Way, the Truth, the Life
Hold my hands and Walk with me
I'm the Lord, I'll never let you Down
Never let you Down,
Neva let you Down
Never Let You Down  Frank Edwards Lyrics
Have you ever felt
Like you were down and out
Speaking Words of Faith
With a Heart full of Doubt
Maybe you felt Weak
And you couldn't even Speak
If you're Searching for a Way
I am the Answer that you Seek
I'm the same from the Start
Against the Fiery Arrows
The Light to your Path
When you walk through the Shadows
I am Alpha and Omega
Your Protector and your Savior
I'll never let you down
And you know I never will
I'll never let you Drown
Caused the Storms to be Still
In the midst of the Waves
And the Storms and the Winds
I Still remain the same
I'm your Strength from Within

{ I'm the One
Who Lifts you Up
When you need me,
Am already there
I'm the Lord, I'll never let you Down
I'm the Way, the Truth, the Life
Hold my hands and Walk with me
I'm the Lord, I'll never let you Down } [x3]
Never let you Down
Never let you Down
