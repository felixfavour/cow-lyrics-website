It's all because of You
It's all because of Your grace
That I'm still standing here right now

It's all because of You
It's all because of Your love
That I'm still standing

I could have missed my way
I could have fallen on the wayside
But You are always there to help me

I could have missed my way
I could have fallen on the wayside
But You always helped me

Lord, I'm amazed by how You've shown mercy
Chineke me o, thank You for Your mercy
