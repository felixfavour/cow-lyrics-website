  I was a wretch, I remember who I was
  I was lost, I was blind, I was running out of time.
  Sin separated, the breach was far too wide
  But from the far side of the chasm, You had me in Your sight
  
  VERSE 2
  So You made a way, across the great divide
  Left behind, Heaven's throne, to build it here inside
  There at the cross You paid the debt I owed
  Broke my chains, Freed my soul and for the first time I had Hope 
  
  CHORUS
  Thank You Jesus, for the blood applied
  Thank You Jesus, it has washed me white
  Thank You Jesus, You have saved my life 
  Brought me from the darkness into glorious light
  
  VERSE 3
  You took my place, laid inside my tomb of sin
  You were buried for three days but then You walked right out again
  Now death has no sting and life has no end
  For I have been transformed by the blood of the Lamb
  
  BRIDGE
  There is nothing stronger 
  Than the wonder working power of the blood the blood
  That calls us sons and daughters 
  We are ransomed by our Father 
  
  
  Through the blood 
  There is nothing stronger 
  OH the wonder working power of the blood the blood
  
  
  That calls us sons and daughters 
  We are ransomed by our Father 
  Through the Blood 
  The Blood
