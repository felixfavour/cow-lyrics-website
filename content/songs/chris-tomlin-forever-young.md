rever Young - Chris Tomlin
Produced byï¼Ed Cash
There's a river that runs wild and free
You're the river god inside of me
I am born again I'm saved by love
O my soul
In your presence I'm forever young
Everlasting god from age to age
A thousand years with you is like a day
I believe there's greater things to come
O my soul
In your presence I'm forever young
You rain rivers in my soul
You are the fire in my bones
Jesus you rain rivers in my soul
In your presence I'm forever young
Soon this world will surely pass away
Your eternal blood runs through my veins
With my final breath I'll sing your song
Praise the Lord
In your presence I'm forever young
Oh you rain rivers in my soul
You are the fire in my bones
Jesus you rain rivers in my soul
In your presence I'm forever young
God you rain rivers in my soul in my soul
And you are the fire in my bones
Jesus you rain rivers in my soul
In your presence I'm forever young
Oh I'm forever young
Oh I'm forever young
Forever young
In your presence I'm forever young
