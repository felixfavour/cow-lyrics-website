[Intro: Kirk Franklin & 
The Family
]
Merry Christmas, Karen (
Merry Christmas, Kirk
)
Merry Christmas, Mother (
Merry Christmas, Kirk
)
Merry Christmas, Tam (
Merry Christmas, Kirk
)
Merry Christmas, Yolanda (
Merry Christmas, Kirk
)
Merry Christmas, bruh (
Merry Christmas, Kirk
)
It's time
It's time again for the holidays
The pain and sorrow miles away
But in my spirit I've gotta say
There's no Christmas without You
With caroling and mistletoe
Children playing in the snow
But in their hearts the world must know
There's no Christmas without You (
Your gift
)
[Chorus: Choir, 
Kirk Franklin
]
Your gift of love (
Yeah
)
Such a sacrifice to give
Sent from above
So that we shall forever live (
So with our voices
)
So with our voices lifted high (
Hallelujah
)
And praises that reaches to the sky (
Jesus, You're
)
Jesus, You're the reason why
There's no Christmas without You
(
Yo, David, can we say that part again? Let's say that again, there's
)
There's no Christmas without You
