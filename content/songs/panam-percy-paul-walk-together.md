we are special people called to be Kings and we have staffs in our hands. the earth  and it's wishes, we belong to our God, let's go and reclaim our land, let us walk together, cause we love each other.
we have one father one spirit land, as long as we are truly walking in thy spirit, whatever is formed against, we shall conquer.
let us put asunder, let us put asunder, the flesh from the spirit and the spirit would live, the time is right here, that God is looking for worshippers in spirit and in truth, let us walk together, cause we love each other and we have one father, one spirit one lord, as long we're truly walking in thy spirit, whatever is formed against us we shall conquer. let us be mindful, let us be mindful of the things that we see, the beauty and cares of this world,
let us be faithful, for soon we shall see dat  the victory has been on our side.
let us walk together, cause we love each other andwe have one father one spirit one lord, as long as we're truly walking in spirit, whatever is formed against us we shall conquer.

so now
let us walk together, cause we love each other and we have one father one spirit one lord, as long as we're truly walking in thy spirit whatever is formed against us we shall conquer.
