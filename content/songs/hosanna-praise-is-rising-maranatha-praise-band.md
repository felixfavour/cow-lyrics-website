Praise is rising
Eyes are turning to You
We turn to You
Hope is stirring
Hearts are yearning for You
We long for You
Cause when we see You
We find strength
To face the day
In Your presence
All our fears
Are washed away
Washed away
Hosanna
Hosanna
You are the God who saves us
Worthy of all our praises
Hosanna
Hosanna
Come have Your way among us
We welcome You here, Lord Jesus
Hear the sound of
Hearts returning to You
We turn to You
In Your kingdom
Broken lives are made new
You make us new
