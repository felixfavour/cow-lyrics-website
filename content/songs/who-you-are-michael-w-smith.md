[Instrumental]
I never wanted you to feel this way
Somebody told you wrong
And now you've broken down inside this pain
A million miles from home
(Give me time)
I wanna lead you out
(Give me time)
I won't let you leave now
Yeah
I know the wolf's howling at your door
Says you're not strong enough
Telling you not to fight no more
I hope you don't give up
(Give me time)
There's so much more than this
(Give me time)
I'll show you how to live
Oh yeah
