Fire fire
Fall on us
Start a new revival
Fire fall on us
Fire fire
Fall on us
Start a new revival
Fire fall on us
Like it did on the day of Pentecost
Rushing in like a mighty wind
Fill us up with Your presence and Your power
Lord do it again
We are here crying out on one accord
Let the heavens touch the earth
Come and light a passion in our hearts
And Lord let it burn
Fire fire
Fall on us
Start a new revival
Fire fall on us
My prayer tonight is that God would be glorified
And that the world will come to know who He is
Overwhelmed by Your glory and Your grace
You consume us with Your love
Give us more and more of who You are
We can't get enough
Fire fire
Fall on us
Start a new revival
Fire fall on us
Fire fire
Fall on us
Start a new revival
Fire fall on us
You
You're the only one who can bring new life
You
You're the only one who can light this fire
(Hey)
You
You're the only one who can bring new life
(Bring new life)
You
You're the only one who can light this fire
(Light this fire)
Fire fire
Fall on us
Start a new revival
Fire fall on us
(Fire fall down)
Fire (we need it)
Fire
(Oh yeah)
Fall On Us
(Baptize us)
Start a new revival
(Revival never ends)
Fire fall on us
(Sing it again fire)
Fire fire
(Fire fall down)
Fall on us
(Start a new revival)
Start a new revival
Fire fall on us
(Fire fall down on us)
Fire fire
(We need it, we need it, we need it)
Fall on us
(Have Your way)
Start a new revival
Fire fall on us
Acts 2 and 1 says
When the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
Verse 4.
And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
Just like He did it before
Help me let Him know we need him to do it again
Just like You did it before
Lord we are ready for more
Just like You did it before
Lord we are ready for more
(Just like)
Just Like You did it before
(Lord we)
Lord we are ready for more
(Just like)
Just like You did it before
(Lord we)
Lord we are ready for more
(Just like)
Just like You did it before
(On Pentecost)
Lord we are ready for more
(Just Like)
Just like You did it before
(In the upper room)
Lord we are ready for more
(Lord, we)
Lord we are ready for more
(Tonight)
Lord we are ready for more
(Right now)
Lord we are ready for more
(Baptize us in the Holy Ghost)
Lord we are ready for more
You know what
I've been walking with the Lord a long time
And I have to have the Holy Ghost
