Not To Us album version and the WOW Hits 2003 album version:
All of You is more than enough for all of me
For every thirst and every need
You satisfy me with Your love
And all I have in You is more than enough
You are my supply
My breath of life
And still more awesome than I know
You are my reward
Worth living for
And still more awesome than I know
And all of You is more than enough for all of me
For every thirst and every need
You satisfy me with Your love
And all I have in You is more than enough
You're my sacrifice
Of greatest price
And still more awesome than I know
You're the coming King
You are everything
And still more awesome than I know
And all of You is more than enough for all of me
For every thirst and every need
You satisfy me with Your love
And all I have in You
