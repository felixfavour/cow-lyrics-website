Lift up your hands O ye gates
Be lifted up ancient doors
People of God open your hearts
Bow down and worship the Lord
He is the Lord strong and mighty
He is the head over all
Holy, Almighty God He is holy, holy
Worthy, He is exalted and worthy
Worthy of praises
All nations come, worship the Lamb
Join in the heavenly song
For He was slain and with His blood
He has redeemed us to God
He is the Lord strong and mighty
He is the head over all
Holy, Almighty God He is holy, holy
Worthy, He is exalted and worthy
Worthy of praises
Worthy the Lamb who was slain
Worthy of power and riches
And honor and praise
