GOD SENT HIS SON, THEY CALLED HIM JESUS HE CAME TO LOVE HEAL AND FORGIVE HE LIVED AND DIED TO BUY MY PARDON AN EMPTY GRAVE IS THERE TO PROVE MY SAVIOR LIVES

BECAUSE HE LIVES I CAN FACE TOMORROW BECAUSE HE LIVES  ALL FEAR IS GONE BECAUSE I KNOW HE HOLDS THE FUTURE AND LIFE IS WORTH THE LIVING JUST BECAUSE HE LIVES.

HOW SWEET TO HOLD A NEW BORN BABY AND TO FEEL THE PRIDE AND JOY IT GIVES BUT GREATER STILL IS THE CALM ASSURANCE THIS CHILD CAN FACE UNCERTAIN DAYS BECAUSE HE LIVES .

BECAUSE HE LIVES I CAN FACE TOMORROW BECAUSE HE LIVES  ALL FEAR IS GONE BECAUSE I KNOW HE HOLDS THE FUTURE AND LIFE IS WORTH THE LIVING JUST BECAUSE HE LIVES.

AND THEN ONE DAY I’LL CROSS THAT RIVER I’LL FIGHT LIFE'S FINAL WAR WITH PAIN AND THEN AS DEATH GIVES WAY TO VICTORY I’LL SEE THE LIGHTS OF GLORY AND I’LL KNOW HE LIVES

BECAUSE HE LIVES I CAN FACE TOMORROW BECAUSE HE LIVES  ALL FEAR IS GONE BECAUSE I KNOW HE HOLDS THE FUTURE AND LIFE IS WORTH THE LIVING JUST BECAUSE HE LIVES.
