Long, long time ago
In the land of Bethlehem, I'm told
Angel Gabriel came to earth to tell
Heaven waited for the birth
And a hush had filled the earth
And in between the two
Love came crashing through
Sing, angels, sing
Good news you bring
Until all earth and heaven ring
Lift up your voice
A baby boy is born to make us free
Sing, angels, sing
Sing, angels, sing
Sing, angels, sing
All was quiet and still
For the poor men on the hill
And though they had no gold
They'd be given wealth untold
Shepherd's worshipping
As a million angels' voices sing
And on a of praise
Heaven and earth unite that day
