In the quiet, in the stillness
I know that You are God
In the secret of Your Presence
I know there I am restored
[Pre-Chorus]
When You call I won't refuse
Each new day, again I'll choose
There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise
In the chaos, in confusion
I know You're sovereign still
In the moment of my weakness
You give me grace to do Your Will
[Pre-Chorus]
So, when You call I won't delay
This my song through all my days
