Yeah how can i hide from your goodness,
Tell me how could i hide from your love,
Boshe nshe mi i need you the closest,
Its unforgettable I'm reminded who You are,
When I'm up you're my spiral,
You're my backbone, my spinal,
Me i do everything you say, coz your every word is final,
You're my rock you're my ? ?? ??
You're my pillar You're my (Pilot?)
I mean I look at what you made and everything is specialll.
(Yoruba)
Jiji moji lowuro, You're the one I call,
(Lekan?) ogbe mi sokan O'ngbo,
I need You only You in each and every way,
On each and every Day,
You're something i cant replace
