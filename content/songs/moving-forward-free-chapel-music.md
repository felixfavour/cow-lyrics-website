What a moment You have brought me to
Such a freedom I have found in You
And You're the Healer who makes all things new
Yeah yeah yeah
I'm not going back I'm moving ahead
Here to declare to You my past is over
In You all things are made new
Surrendered my life to Christ
I'm moving (moving forward)
You have risen with all power in Your hands
You have given me a second chance
Hallelujah hallelujah yeah yeah yeah oh
Yeah yeah yeah oh oh oh
[Bridge]
Not going back moving ahead
Here to declare to You yeah my past is over
In You all things are made new
Surrendered my life to Christ
I'm moving moving forward
