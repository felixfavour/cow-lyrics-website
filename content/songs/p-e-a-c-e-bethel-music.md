You will stay true even when the lies come
Your word remains truth even when my thoughts don't line up
I will stand tall on each promise You made
Let the rest fade away
There's a peace far beyond all understanding
May it ever set my heart at ease
Dare anxiety come, I'll remember
That peace is a promise You keep
Peace is a promise You keep
You will stay true even in the chaos
Your word remains truth even when my mind wreaks havoc
I will be still for I've known all along
My Jehovah Shalom
There's a peace far beyond all understanding
May it ever set my heart at ease
What anxiety fails to remember
Is peace is a promise You keep
Peace is a promise You keep
