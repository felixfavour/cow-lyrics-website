On Christ alone, our chief cornerstone
No other foundation can we build upon
Not philosophy nor the wisdom of men
All other ground is sinking sand
[Chorus: Naomi Raine]
Upon this rock You build Your church
And the gates of hell will not prevail
When we bind and loose, we proclaim Your truth
And in Jesus' name we will not fail
Never fail, woah-oh-oh-ooh
Oh, He’s building His church now, now, now, now, now
Crucified, raised up from the dead
Led captivity captive, it is finished
Oh, He gave us the keys, His authority
Now we are joint heirs to the praise of His glory, glory
[Chorus: Chris Brown & Naomi Raine]
Upon this rock You build Your church
And the gates of hell will not prеvail (No, no)
When we bind and loose, wе proclaim Your truth
And in Jesus' name we will not fail
