Where would I be
If you had not been by my side
How could I rise to meet
The morning of the day
You tender mercy
Always calling from behind
At times I could not see you
Even though you were close by
Lord You are good
You are good
And your mercy forever endures
Lord You are good
You are good
And your mercy forever endures
Where would I be
If you had not been by my side
How could I rise to meet
The morning of the day
You tender mercy
Always calling from behind
At times I could not see you
Even though you were close by
Lord You are good
You are good
And your mercy forever endures
Lord You are good
You are good
And your mercy forever endures
