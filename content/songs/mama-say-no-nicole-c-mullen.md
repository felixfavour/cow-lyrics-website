Mama say no
You better think twice
Mama say no
Mama say no
You better think twice
Mama say no
I was livin' on my own
No need for curfew, see, I was grown
Then came Junior, his charm was there
Tall, dark and handsome with wavy hair
If mama say no
You better think twice
If mama say no
Take her advice
If mama say no
You better think twice
If mama say no
Take her advice
You know Junior would say nice things
Like, "Girl, I love you"
"You're the one of my dreams", psych!
He forgot to tell me
He was rough and mean
Enough to give me whiplash
If you know what I mean
