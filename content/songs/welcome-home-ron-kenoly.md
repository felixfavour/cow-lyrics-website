The road was straight and narrow
Leading to my father's house
The gates were open wide
Awaiting my return
Near them stood my father
With his arms stretched out to me
With tears on his face
I heard him say
Welcome home
I've missed you so much
My heart has been broken
Since the day you went away
Welcome home
I'll prepare a celebration
Come take your place beside me
You've been gone so long
Welcome home
His hand was on my shoulders
As we walked up to the house
Mom peeped out the front door
And then came running out
She threw her arms around me
And squeezed me like only Mama can
And then kissed me on my cheek
And with my face held in her hands
