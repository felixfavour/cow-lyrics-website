Here is love, vast as the ocean
Loving-kindness as the flood
When the Prince of Life, our Ransom
Shed for us His precious blood
Who His love will not remember
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He will never be forgotten
Throughout Heaven's eternal days
[Turn]
Here is love, vast as the ocean
Loving-kindness as the flood
When the Prince of Life, our Ransom
Shed for us His precious blood
And who His love will not remember
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He will never be forgotten
Throughout Heaven's eternal days
