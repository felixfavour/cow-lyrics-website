'Twas a life filled with aimless desperation Without hope walked the shell of a man. Then a hand with a nail print stretched downward, Just one touch then a new life began.

And the old rugged cross made the difference. In a life bound for heartache and defeat; I will praise Him forever and ever For the cross made the difference for me.

Barren walls echoed harshness and anger. Little feet run in terror to hide;
Now those walls ring with love, warmth and laughter, Since the giver of life moved inside.

And the old rugged cross made the difference. In a life bound for heartache and defeat; I will praise Him forever and ever For the cross made the difference for me.

There's a room filled with sad, ashen faces. Without hope death has wrapped them in gloom; But at the side of a saint there's rejoicing, For life can't be sealed in a tomb.

And the old rugged cross made the difference. In a life bound for heartache and defeat; I will praise Him forever and ever For the cross made the difference for me.
