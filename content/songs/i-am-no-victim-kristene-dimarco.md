I am no victim, I live with a vision
I'm covered by the force of love
Covered in my Savior's blood
I am no orphan, I'm not a poor man
The kingdom's now become my own
And with the King, I've found a home
[Pre-Chorus]
He's not just reviving
Not simply restoring
Greater things have yet to come
Greater things have yet to come
He is my Father, I do not wonder
If His plans for me are good
If He'll come through like He should
'Cause He is provision and enough wisdom
To usher in my brightest days
To turn my mourning into praise
[Pre-Chorus]
He's not just reviving
Not simply restoring
Greater things have yet to come
Greater things have yet to come
