So like the rain, come and drench us in love
And let Your glory rush in like a flood

To know Your goodness and see Your glory
Oh, we're transformed by this one thing
To know Your presence and see Your beauty
So I can see it now, Your kingdom come (all around us)
I can hear it now, the sounds of heaven
You said that if we ask, we'll receive
So we are asking for Your greater measure

So like the rain, come drench us in love
And let Your power rush in like a flood

Yeah, we are fixed on this one thing
To know Your goodness and see Your glory
Oh, we're transformed by this one thing
To know Your presence and see Your beauty
