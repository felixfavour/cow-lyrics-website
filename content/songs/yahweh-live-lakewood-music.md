There's one God that I serve
Maker of heaven and the earth
Formed by the power of His word
Oh I will forever lift Thy name
Yahweh the only one who’s holy who’s worthy
Of our praise You deserve the honor the glory
So we say there’s no God greater
No one greater than Yahweh
There’s one God that I know
Who can raise the dead and save my soul
You can do the impossiblе
Oh I will forever lift Thy name
[Bridge 1]
No king or kingdom could match Your famе
The greatest powers bow to Your name
Angels in heaven declare Your praise
And here on earth we shall do the same
[Bridge 2]
Oh no one like our God no one like our God
Oh no one like our God no one like our God
