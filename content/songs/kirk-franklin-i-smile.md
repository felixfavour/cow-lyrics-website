I dedicate this song to recession, depression and unemployment
This song's for you
Today's a new day
But there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds
And it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day
But where are my blue skies?
Where is the love and the joy
That you promised me?
Tell me it's alright
I'll be honest with you
I almost gave up, but a power
That I can't explain
Fell from Heaven like a shower
Now
When I think how much better I'm gon' be when this is over
I smile,
Even though I hurt, see, I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
What you do? I smile
Come on, smile
It's so hard to look up when you've been down
Sure would hate to see you give up now
God's people, you look so much better when you smile, so smile
Now every day ain't gon' be perfect,
But it still don't mean today don't have purpose
Come on
Today's a new day
But there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds
And it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
It ain't easy, but today's a new day
But tell me where are my blue skies
Where is that love yo?
Where is the love and the joy
That you promised me?
Tell me it's alright
The truth is I almost gave up, but a power
That I can't explain
The Holy Ghost power, yo
Fell from Heaven like a shower
Now
Now know we've been hurt you but still I smile,
Even though I hurt, see, I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
Still, I smile,
Hallelujah, smile
It's so hard to look up when you've been down
Sure would hate to see you give up now
God's people, you look so much better when you smile
Let's go, smile for me
Can you just smile for me?
Whatever you're in right now
Smile for me, smile
Can you just smile for me?
And my people say
You look so much better when you
You look so much better when you
You look so much better when you
You look so much better when you
I say you look so much better when you
And while you're waiting
You look so much better when you
And while you're praying
You look so much better when you
Look in the mirror
You look so much better when you
Always remember
You look so much better when you smile
Come on
I almost gave up, I almost gave up
But a power, that I can't explain
But the Holy Ghost power, yo
Fell from Heaven like a shower
Came down from Heaven now
Hardships, difficulties
Right now
Tears storms this is what I do
I smile
Even though I hurt, see, I smile
What it feels good
I know God is working so I smile
All things are working
Even though I've been here for a while
Still I smile,
Smile, hallelujah
It's so hard to look up when you've been down
I know it's hard right now
Sure would hate to see you give up now
Because you're a winner
You look so much better when you smile
You look better, so, smile
Dallas, you look so much better when you
New Orleans, you look so much better when you come one
Cleveland, you look so much better when you
Detroit, you look so much better when you
Philly, you look so much better when you
Jersey, you look so much better when you
L.A., you look so much better when you
All my people say you look so much better when you smile
See, I just don't want you to be happy
'Cause you gotta have something happening
I want you to have joy
'Cause can't nobody take that away from you
I see you smile
