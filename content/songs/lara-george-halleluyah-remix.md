Someone shout hallelujah!
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
In every situation hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah oo, (chorus) hallelujah

Hallelujah, (chorus) hallelujah
Shout hallelujah!!, in every situation, hallelujah, hallelujah
Hey!!, you are the God that answers by fire
Almighty God that is your name
You never forget me, of this I am sure
Alpha and Omega, Beginning and the end
Heeea! hallelujah, (chorus) hallelujah
Oo, ha-lle-lujah, shoout hallelujah!, in every situation, hallelujah, hallelujah(chorus) hallelujah-aa
And when I think, (chorus) and when I think
That life's trouble(chorus) that life's trouble
Could weigh me down
That's it the time, that's it the time
Oh! to fall on my knees
And start to sing, and start to sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
