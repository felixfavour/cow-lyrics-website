[Chorus]
'Cause I know that You're alive
You came to fix my broken life
And I'll sing to glorify
Your Holy Name, Jesus Christ
You bought my life with the Blood
That You shed on the cross
When You died for the sins of men
And You let out a cry, crucified
Now alive in me
These hands are Yours
Teach them to serve
As You please and I'll reach out
Desperate to see all the greatness of God
May my soul rest assured in You
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never be the same
No I'll never be the same
[Chorus]
