My life is a prodigal story
Saved out of the enemy’s plans for me
I’m home in the house of God
My life is a rescue story
(I have freedom)
I have freedom
I have freedom
Thank You, Jesus, I am free
No more chains on me
Now in Christ, I live
Thank You, Jesus, I am free
Our God is a jailbreaker
Tears down unshakeable walls
Sing loud, so all can hear us
(C'mon, you sing it!)
He is unstoppable
I have freedom
I have freedom
Thank You, Jesus, I am free
