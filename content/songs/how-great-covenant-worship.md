[Instrumental]
[Chorus: David Binion & Nicole Binion]
My God, how great You are
How great, how great You are
My God how great You are
How great, how great You are
The Heavens are telling
Telling the earth how great You are
We are responding to Your love
The oceans are rising
Rising and falling at Your word
And we are responding to Your love
[Chorus: David Binion & Nicole Binion]
My God, how great You are
How great how great You are
My God, how great You are
How great, how great You are
My God, how great You are
How great, how great You are
My God, how great You are
How great, how great You are
