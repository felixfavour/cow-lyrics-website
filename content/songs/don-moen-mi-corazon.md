my heart is filled with song of praise
you gave me hope, you made a way
now I long to live in your presence for all of my day
Chorus
my soul sings, my spirit shouts
with every breathe I'm crying out
I want to live for you alone
you have captured my heart, mi corazon
Lord I give you my whole heart, mi corazon
amazing grace has rescued me
you paid the price, you set me free
I will sing your praises forever
my savior and my king
my soul sings, my spirit shout
with every breathe, I'm crying out
i want to live for you alone
you have captured my heart, mi corazon
Lord I give you my whole heart, mi corazon
i will give you Glory
tell the world story how you rescued me
I'm the guilty one but you sacrificed your son
your one and only
now I stand before you blameless and holy
my soul sings, my spirit shout
with every breathe, I'm crying out
i want to live for you alone
you have captured my heart
Chorus
my soul sings, my spirit shout
with every breathe, I'm crying out
i want to live for you alone
you have captured my heart, mi corazon
Lord I give you my whole heart, mi corazon
