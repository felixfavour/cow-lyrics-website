There are days
When I feel
The best of me
Is ready to begin
Then they're days
When I feel
I'm letting go
And soaring on the wind
But I've learned in laughter or in pain
How to survive
I get on my knees
I get on my knees
There I am before the love that
Changes me
See, I don't know how
But there's power
When I'm on my knees
I can be
In a crowd
All by myself
Or almost anywhere
When I feel
There's a need
To talk with God
He is Emmanuel
When I close my eyes
No darkness there
There's only light
