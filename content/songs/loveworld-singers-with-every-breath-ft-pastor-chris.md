With Every Breath, I tell of your wonder
When I breathe in , breathe out  lord, I'm singing of you.
To write about all your works
Measure the depths of your love
A million and one s will not be enough
(2*)
Light of my life
 the sun needs you to shine
A God like you, I'll never find
All you have made show ur wisdom and mighty strength
Lord I glorify you with every breath
(2*)
Ooooooooooooh lord
You are the light of my life lord
I glorify you oh lord with every breath
Stones will never cry out in my place
When I sleep, when I'm awake my soul honors your name
You wrote the constellations to tell the story of creation , and how you formed with the spoken word Man from the dust
(2*)
Light of my life, the sun needs you to shine
A God like you, I'll never find
All you have made, show your wisdom and mighty strength
Lord, I glorify you with every breath
For your Grace and Goodness
We your saints bless you
We'll speak of the Glory of your Kingdom and your Power with every breath
(2*)
Light of my life
The sun needs you to shine
A God like you , I'll never find
All you have made show your wisdom and mighty strength
Lord I glorify you with every breath
(2*)
