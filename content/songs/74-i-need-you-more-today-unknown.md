There are decisions I can't make on my own. And there are times I can't face all alone. But you said you'd walk with me down life's troubled roads, and you said, "come unto me and I'll bear your heavy load. 

I need you more today than I did yesterday. Mountains are higher, and rivers are wider. I need you more today than I did yesterday. Help me remember I need you more today. 

When I wake up in the morning and I fear to face the day. Let me feel your gentle hands leading the way. Yesterday has come and gone with those trials far behind. But I'm ever learning Lord, and everyday I find. 

I need you more today than I did yesterday. Mountains are higher, and rivers are wider. I need you more today than I did yesterday. Help me remember I need you more today.
