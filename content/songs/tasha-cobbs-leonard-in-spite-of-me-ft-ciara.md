I don't cross every t
I don't every I
Got more flaws than a little
and I'm messed up a thousand times
I don't always commit
Sometimes I give up too quick
then I get tired of trying to run away
from who I am to who I wanna be
bridge
some days are better than others
I can be up then I'm down
but beyond my mistake
I'm found in your grace
And this one thing will never change
you still love me
 in spite of me
you still chose me
how can it be
Every scar
Every flaw
(You see it all*2)
you still love me
love me
ooh (in spite of me*2)
Yeah I'm stubbon at heart
I'm quick to put up a guard
 I do it all by myself
I won't ask for help
And sometimes my mouth is smart
I can be insecure
Counting other people's blessings
and never stop to notice
what I've got
Bridge
