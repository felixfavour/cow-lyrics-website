When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roar
Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my soooooul
Chorus: It is well
    it is well
   With my soul
   With my soul
    it is well
    it is well
   With my soooooul
My sin o the bliss of this glorious love
My sin not in part but the whole
He's nailed to the Cross
And I bear it no more
Praise the LORD
Praise the LORD
Ooo my soooooul
  Chorus: it is well
      it is well
      With my soul
      With my soul
      it is well
      it is well
     With my soooooul
And LORD is the day when my faith shall besight the clouds be rolled back as a scroll
The trump shall resound
And the LORD shall descend
Heathen soul, it is well with my soul
Chorus:  it is well
     it is well
     With my soul
     With my soul
     it is well
     it is well
     With my soooooul
