I know it's all you've got to just be strong
And it's a fight just to keep it together, together
I know you think that you are too far gone
But hope is never lost
Hope is never lost
Hold on, don't let go, hey
Hold on, don't let go
Just take one step closer
Put one foot in front of the other
You'll get through this
Just follow the light in the darkness
You're gonna be okay
I know your heart is heavy from those nights
But just remember that you are a fighter, a fighter
You never know just what tomorrow holds
And you're stronger than you know
You're stronger than you know
Hold on, don't let go, hey
Hold on, don't let go
Just take one step closer
Put one foot in front of the other
You'll get through this
Just follow the light in the darkness
One step closer
Put one foot in front of the other
You'll get through this
Just follow the light in the darkness
You're gonna be okay
And when the night is closing in
Don't give up and don't give in
This won't last, it's not the end
It's not the end
You're gonna be okay
When the night is closing in
Don't give up and don't give in
This won't last, it's not the end
It's not the end
You're gonna be okay
