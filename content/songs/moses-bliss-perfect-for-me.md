From today to the end of days
I promise to be there whenever you call my name
I'll be right by your side o every step Ill hold your hand
Even through the storms and all the trials of life o
January to December year after year
I'll shower you with love
Pamper you with care
Nothing will ever come between us o my dear (ehh)
With Oluwa at the center of our affairs
Cause this love o this love that am feeling
Nothing in this world go fit stop or conceal it
I won dey show you off to the world every season
Celebrate our love every single day
They say no one is an island
No one is the best o
Nobody fit get everything all to himself o
Nobody can have it all say
Nobody is perfect o
But my baby you are perfect for me( uhhhhh ahhh)
Beauty inside out my baby you complete
( Ahhh ahhh)
My number 1 nobody dey compete
( ahhh ahhhh)
When I look at you I see my dreams come true
You be my dreams come truuuee baby
Am so glad o (so glad o)
Am so elated o(e-la-la-la)
And no words could tell the way I dey feel
Deep in my heart o
Am glad I waited o
Now I get to spend forever with you
Cause this love o this love that am feeling
Nothing in this world go fit stop or conceal it
I won dey show you off to the world every season
Celebrate our love every single day
They say no one is an island
No one is the best o
Nobody fit get everything all to himself o
Nobody can have it all say
Nobody is perfect o
But my baby you are perfect for me
They say no one is an island
No one is the best o
Nobody fit get everything all to himself o
Nobody can have it all (Ohhhh ahhhh)
Nobody is perfect o
But my baby you are perfect for me
( Perfect for meeeee)
