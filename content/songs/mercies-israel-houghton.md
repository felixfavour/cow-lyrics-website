Nobody said things would always be easy
Nobody said it would always be nice
Nobody said that every day would turn out perfectly right
Somebody said my yoke is easy
Somebody said my burden is light
Somebody said that weeping only lasts for just a night
So when your day comes to an end
And your night is closing in
Tears fall uncontrollably
But you're gonna see
Oh, oh, oh, your help is on the way
You gotta know
Tomorrow is another day
His mercies are fresh every morning
Nobody said there would always be sunshine
Nobody said there would never be rain
Nobody said that you would never have just one of those days
Somebody said that I'll be your lifeline
Somebody said I'll take all your pain
Somebody said that I specialize in impossible things
When there's darkness all around
And you feel like breakin' down
Tears fall uncontrollably
But you're gonna see
