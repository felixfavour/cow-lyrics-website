I can be Real with You
Say anything and not be afraid
You made me
And You like what You made
You made me and
You don’t make Mistakes
I can be Real with You
You Take me just as I am
You’d Choose me
All Over again
I am the One You Love
I am the One You Love
I don’t have to Prove anything
There’s Room
At Your Table for me
I am the One You Love
I am the One You Love
I know You’re Proud of me
Even though
I don’t Deserve it somеtimes
No, I’m not a Perfect Child
But I still makе my Father Smile
I know You’re Proud of me
