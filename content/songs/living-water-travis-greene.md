I was down until I got tired and got up
I was broken until I got to the potter
I was alone no one could help me out
I was empty and dry
Until the rain fell down
So where do we go from here?
Lost in the middle of nowhere close to home
And I can hear your voice so clear
Saying come to where you are
So I'm running
Cause I need living water
I'm coming back to the well where we first met
I need living water, pour yourself in me
Cause you are all I need
Living water
Moving fast, through life
Tryina be the best I can
Outside, while forgetting what I need to last
This time would you lead me and hold my hand?
So where do we go from here?
Caught in the middle of somewhere close to home
And I can hear your voice so clear
Saying come here where you are
So I'm running
