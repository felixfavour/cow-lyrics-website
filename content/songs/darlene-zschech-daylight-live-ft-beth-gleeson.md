I will dwell, in Your promise
In the light, of Your truth
You're the Hope, that Jesustains me
Always safe, here with You
You are here, in the valley
You are here, in the storm
You're the glory of daylight
Breaking through, like the dawn
And You are God Most High
Yet You hear my cry
And You run to my defense
And I will walk unharmed
Angels all around
I will trust and not be moved
In Your love, l'm protected
L will stand, and I will sing
You're the God of angel armies
Heaven's wings, over me
You're the God of angel armies
Heaven's wings, over me
You are God Most High
Yet You hear my cry
And You run to my defense
I will walk unharmed
Angels all around
I will trust and not be moved
You won't let go, You won't give in
You surround me with Your love
Your majesty, it covers me
You surround me with Your love
You won't let go, You won't give in
You surround me with Your love
Your majesty, it covers me
You surround me with Your love
You won't let go, You won't give in
You surround me with Your love
Your majesty, it covers me
You surround me with Your love
You are God Most High
Yet You hear my cry
And You run to my defense
And I will walk unharmed
Angels all around
I will trust and not be moved
You are God Most High
Yet You hear my cry
And You run to my defense
And I will walk unharmed
Angels all around
I will trust and not be moved
You won't let go, You won't give in
You surround me with Your love
Your majesty, it covers me
You surround me with Your love
You won't let go, You won't give in
You surround me with Your love
Your majesty, it covers me
You surround me with Your love
