If I could I, I'd get away
Far from all this trouble I see everyday
Nobody wants to show their face
This life is like a, like a mascerade
I know you love me
I know you care
But while I'm hurtin I just need to know your there
Watchin over me and I feel your tellin me
Count it all joy and always remember, life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper, things will get better it's gonna get better
Persecuted, pushed away, didn't think I'd live to see another day
Cried some tears and couldn't pray and when I'd try at times I couldn't find the words to say, but now
I'm stronger, because of you without you Jesus I never could've made it through
Thank you for watchin me lovin me and tellin me
Count it all joy and always remember, life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper, things will get better it's gonna get better
Count it all joy and always remember, life will get better it's gonna get better
No matter the weapon it will not prosper, things will get better it's gonna get better
Life sometimes will change and nobody wants to proclaim, but it's him to help you grow and there's nothin
You need to know
God's in love with you and he'll never let you go
