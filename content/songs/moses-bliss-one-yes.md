I'm encouraged by Your word 
It doesn't matter what life throws at me 
I'm contented in You alone 
It doesn't matter who turn their backs on me 
When challenges stares me at the face 
I square my shoulders cos my God is with me 
You are my strength You are my Joy 
The reason why I live is You 
You are my strength You are my Joy 
The essence of my life is You 
Everybody may give me a no 
But one Yes from God 
Is enough for me
Everybody may give You a no 
But one Yes from God 
Is enough for You 
They May tell you all hope is gone
But you can trust in God
'cos His love is real
You are my strength You are my Joy 
The reason why I live is You 
You are my strength You are my Joy 
The essence of my life is You 
You are my strength You are my Joy 
The reason why I live is You 
You are my strength You are my Joy 
The essence of my life is You 
Everybody may give You a no 
But one Yes from God is enough for You 
Everybody may give You a no 
But one Yes One Yes One Yes
One Yes, One Yes One Yes oh oh oh
One Yes from God is more than enough
One Yes, One Yes One Yes oh oh oh
One Yes from God is more than enough
One Yes, One Yes One Yes oh oh oh
One Yes from God is more than enough
You are my strength You are my Joy 
The reason why I live is You 
You are my strength You are my Joy 
The essence of my life is You 
Everybody may give You a no 
But one Yes from God defeats every no
One Yes is enough
