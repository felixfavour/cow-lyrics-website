[Instrumentals]
We give thanks, to You Lord
For Your love, that endures
We give thanks, and we are sure
That You are faithful, we are grateful
We give praise, all is well
For Your love, never fails
We give praise, and we will tell
That You are faithful, we are grateful
Oh! Oh-oh-oh!
Let the world, let the world sing
Of Your love, so amazing
Let our praise, let our praise be
The song of the redeemed
Let the whole world sing
We are here, only by
The grace of God, on our side
We are here, to testify
That You are faithful, we are grateful
Oh! Oh-oh-oh
