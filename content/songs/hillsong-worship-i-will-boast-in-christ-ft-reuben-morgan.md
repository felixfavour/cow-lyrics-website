All I have because of Jesus
All this promise
Won for me
When He paid the highest ransom
Once for always
For my freedom
I will boast, in Christ alone
His righteousness
And not my own
I will cling to Christ my hope
His mercy reigns
Now and forever
Love will never lose its power
All my failures, could not erase
And now I walk within Your favor
Grace unending
My salvation
I will boast, in Christ alone
His righteousness
And not my own
I will cling to Christ my hope
His mercy reigns
Now and forever
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
I will boast, in Christ alone
His righteousness
And not my own
I will cling to Christ my hope
His mercy reigns
Now and forever
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
O precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
