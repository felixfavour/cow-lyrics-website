MOURNING INTO DANCING
(Psalm 30, 11-12)
He's turned my mourning
Into dancing again
He's lifted my sorrows
I can't stay silent
I must sing
for His joy has come
(Repeat chorus)
Where there once
Was only hurt
He gave His healing hand
Where there once
Was only pain
He brought comfort
Like a friend
I feel the sweetness
Of His love
Piercing my darkness
I see the bright
And morning sun
As it ushers in
His joyful gladness
(Repeat first chorus)
You've turned my mourning
Into dancing again
You've lifted my sorrows
I can't stay silent
I must sing
for Your joy has come
Where there once
Was only hurt
You gave Your healing hand
Where there once
Was only pain
You brought comfort
Like a friend
I feel the sweetness
Of Your love
Piercing my darkness
I see the bright
And morning sun
As it ushers in
Your joyful gladness
(Repeat second chorus)
Your anger lasts
For a moment in time
But Your favor is here
And will be on me for
All my life time
(Repeat second chorus twice)
