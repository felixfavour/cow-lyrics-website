Your love's making all things new
You're working in all for good
For the things of this world
There is hope renewed
In the life that is found in You
You make all things new
You make all things new
Yesterday and forever
Your love never changing
This hope never fading
Hallelujah
My faith is in things unseen
Bringing life where it has not been
Speaking things that are not
As if they were
I am alive in You
You make all things new
You make all things new
Yesterday and forever
Your love never changing
This hope never fading
Hallelujah
