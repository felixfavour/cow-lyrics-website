Image of God
Who walked with us
Took our sorrows
Carried our cross
You were broken
Death for life
Love has spoken
Opened our eyes
Pre-Chorus:
Now we can see
Now we believe
Your love has made a way
Chorus:
Our King has come
So let us sing
Salvation's song
Of victory
He is alive and we are free
He is alive and we have found our peace
Our King has come
Risen Saviour
Son of God
Brought redemption
Covered our lives
