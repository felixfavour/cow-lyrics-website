HOME AWAY FROM HOME LYRICS
When accusations came and darkness settled in
When I was spiralling, imploding from within
And all the while You held me
Carrying me through

You sheltered me
In the shadow of Your wings
My home away from home
When I was sinking deep too far from peaceful shores
So deeply stained within sinking to rise no more
And from the depths You heard me
The master of the sea

You sheltered me
In the shadow of Your wings
My home away from home
You sheltered me
In the shadow of Your wings
My home away from home
[Bridge]
And I will sing Your praise
And I will sing Your praise
I will sing Your praise
Forever, You reign
And I will sing Your praise
And I will sing Your praise
I will sing Your praise
Forever, You reign
And I will sing Your praise
And I will sing Your praise
I will sing Your praise
Forever, You reign
And I will sing Your praise
And I will sing Your praise
I will sing Your praise
Forever, You reign...
[Outro]
Forever, You reign
Forever, You reign
