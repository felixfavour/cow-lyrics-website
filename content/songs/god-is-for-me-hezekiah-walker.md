Oh my brother you can look up
Oh my sister you've had enough
Things are changing
Follow the plans at hand he has for you
I'm a witness sometimes we cry
We will win this by morning time
Things are changing
Follow the plan and sing these words
When in trouble no despair
Every challenge, I'm aware
God is for me
God is for me
God is for me
God is for me
My position understood
It's all working for my good
God is for me
God is for me
God is for me
God is for me
Oh my brother you can look up
Oh my sister you've had enough
Things are changing
Follow the plans at hand he has for you
I'm a witness sometimes we cry
We will win this by morning time
Things are changing
Follow the plan and sing these words
