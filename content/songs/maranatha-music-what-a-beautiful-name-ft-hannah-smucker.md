You were the word at the beginning
One with God the Lord most high
you give Him glory in creation
Now redeemed in you our Christ...
    Chorus:
    What a beautiful name it is
   What a beautiful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King
What a beautiful name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a beautiful name it is
 The name of Jesus...
Verse 2:
   You didn't want Heaven without us
 So Jesus you brought Heaven down
 Our sin was great , your love was greater...
  What can separate us now....
Chorus:
What a wonderful name it is 2
 The name of  Jesus Christ my King
What a wonderful name it is
 Nothing compares to this
 What a wonderful name it is
  The name of Jesus...
 What a wonderful name it is
 The name of Jesus..
     ...
Death could not hold you
And they tore before you
you silenced the boast of Sin and grave
 The heavens are roaring to the grace of your glory
for you are raised to life again
 You have no rival you have no equal
Now and Forever ....God you reign
Yours is the Kingdom...yours is the glory...
Yours is the name above all names......
Chorus:
What a powerful name it is2
 The name of Jesus Christ my King
 What a powerful name it is
nothing can stand against ...
What a powerful name it is
 The name of Jesus
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus.,...
