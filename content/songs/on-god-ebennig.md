Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Papa na Your hand we dey
Na You we dey look up to
Oh Papa na Your hand we dey
Na You we dey look up to
Eh, oh Lord, oh Lord
Seasons come and seasons go
But Your word will never change
Ever faithful, ever reliable
I put my trust in You
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus love and righteousness
No other foundation
No other foundation
No, no, no, no, no, no
Papa na Your hand we dey
Na You we dey look up to
There is power in Your name
There is healing in Your name, oh na-na-na
We are here
Standing on Your word, eh

Na You we dey look up to
There is power in Your name

Na Who get God no dey fear

Standing on Your word
Standing on Your word, You no dey fail
Standing on Your word, You no dey fail
Standing on Your word
All other Ground are sinking sand (sinking sand)
Standing on Your word
Solid Rock on which I stay
