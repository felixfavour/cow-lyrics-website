I heard Your song coming over the hill
I know it seemed like the world stood still
You were singin' a melody that caught me by surprise
Yeah it sounded familiar to me, like I'd known it all my life
And I keep looking down as I move in closer
My heart is racing now with fear and wonder
Could I come back to You so long on my own
From where I am, I know this is not my home
You're the one I believe
A king and friend has always been holding onto me
You're the one that I have seen
Your life and death, the endless breath breathing into me
[Post-Chorus]
Just the mention of Your name
And I know, I know I've found love
'Cause You're the one
High in a hidden world is where You are found
Where every living thing circles around
I find myself again where I used to be
With the rescued ones falling on my knees
