When it's all said and done
When the dust finally settles
I want to be who You say I am
After all the back and forth
And the journey seems it's over
I've come to see, You're the only way
I have wandered far away
From the shadow of Your presence
I'm back again for another chance
Where You lead me I will go
Where You take me I will follow
Now till forever there is no turning back
I....go stand by Your side
And I go be Your own till the end of time
I....go stand by Your side
And na Your hand I dey till the end of time
My eyes have seen, my ears have heard
And I've discovered from experience
That what You say You will do
Is exactly what You do (ee yeah)
So the wisest thing for mortal man like me
Is to surrender to Your wisdom and Your will (eee)
So here I am, I lay my life before You (oooh)
Cause I tried to do my own thing (yeah)
I tried to go my own way
But I end up running around, running around in circles
So I'm sticking with the One who is the Way
Yes I'm standing with the One who knows the way (eh eh eh eh)
And now until forever
There's no turning back
I....go stand by Your side
And I go be Your own till the end of time
I....go stand by Your side
(I stand by Your side by the strength wey You give me)
And na Your hand I dey till the end of time
(You say you go keep me from falling)
And na Your hand I dey till the end of time
