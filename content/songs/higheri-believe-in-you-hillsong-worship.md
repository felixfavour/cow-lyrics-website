For unto us a Saviour came
Amazing grace that takes the weight
His name is hope for all the earth
His name now and beyond this life
God with us
And You shall be called Almighty God
And we shall declare
Your name is higher higher
Jesus Christ Your name is glorious
Now unto me the Christ redeemed
For you so loved and love me still
And You shall be called Almighty God
And we shall declare
Your name is higher higher
Jesus Christ Your name is glorious
Your name is greater sweeter
In all the earth
Higher, higher, higher, He's higher (2x)
So great and greatly to be praised are You
So great and greatly to be praised (2x)
