Listen can I have your ear
Everybody gather near
Can I ask a question now
Can somebody tell me how
How we got so separated
How we got so torn apart
When did we become divided
Tell me now, how did it start
Some are episcopalian, church of god
Lutheran, Cong, Presbyterian
Gospel, and the CCN
Baptist and Methodist, oneness and the trinity
And we all are one
We all are one my brothers
And we all are one
And we all are one my sisters
And we all are one
And we all are one together
One in the lord
And we all are one my brother
And we all are one
And we all are one my sister
And we all are one
And we all are one
Can we learn to love
