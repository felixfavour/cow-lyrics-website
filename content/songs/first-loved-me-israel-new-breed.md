I can't forget
I still remember
The place You found me
And I surrendered
Where Your grace
Covered my shame
And saw my needs
You gave me hope
Hope and a future
My heart is Yours
Now and forever
I am loved
Only because
You first loved me
And I love you
Jesus I love you
Yes, I love you
Because You first loved me
Your sacrifice
Is overwhelming
Suffered and died
Because You love me
Now I'm alive
Only through Christ
Who first loved me
