Holy... holy... holy
Lord God Almighty
Early in the morning my song shall rise to Thee
Holy... holy... holy
Merciful and mighty
God in three Person
Blessed Trinity
Holy... holy... holy
All the saints adore Thee
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea
All the Cherubim and seraphim are falling down before Thee
Which was, and art, and evermore shall be
(Holy... holy... holy)
Though the darkness hide Thee
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see
Lord... Only Thou art holy
There is none beside Thee
Perfect in pow'r
In love and purity
Holy... holy... holy
Lord God Almighty
All Thy works shall praise Thy Name, in earth and sky and sea
Holy... holy... holy
Merciful and mighty!
You are God in three Persons
(Blessed Trinity)
You are God in three Persons
(Blessed Trinity)
Oooh You are God in three Persons
Blessed Trinity
Hmmmm
