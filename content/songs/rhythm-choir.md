Your voice resounds through the ages
With an endless love for us
Ever calling us to follow
The rhythm of your heart

To embrace those who are hurting
To act justly and love mercy
By your Spirit we will follow
The rhythm of your heart

Oh, Jesus have your way
Oh, Jesus have your way
Open our eyes
Move in our hearts
We are ready

We will go to the broken
We will go to the helpless
We will go
Send us Lord

We will go to the cities
We will go to the nations 
We will go
Send us Lord
