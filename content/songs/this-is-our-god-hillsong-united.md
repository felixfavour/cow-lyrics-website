"This Is Our God"Your grace is enough
More than I need
And Your word I will believe
I wait for You
Draw near again
And Your spirit make me new
And I will fall at Your feet
I will fall at Your feet
And i will worship You here
Your presence in me
Jesus light the way
By the power of Your word
I am restored
I am redeemed
By Your spirit I am free
And I will fall at Your feet
I will fall at Your feet
And I will worship You here
Freely You gave it all for us
Surrendered Your life upon that cross
Great is Your love
Poured out for all
This is our God
