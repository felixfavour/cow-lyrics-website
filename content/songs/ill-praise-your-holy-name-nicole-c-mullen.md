If i could write melodies
To tell you how much i love you
It would be endless
It would be priceless
If i could buy you rubies
Or if i could buy you gold
What would it profit
If your story went untold
But ive much rather give you praise
And your banner forever ill raise
As long as i live
Ill praise your holy name
If i could take the wings
Of an earlymornin' bird
And sail to a place
That no ones ever heard
Youll still be there
Id be in your care
If i could hold the world
In the palms of my hand
Without the savior
See i know i could not stand
