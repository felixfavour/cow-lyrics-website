Saturday was silent
Surely it was through
But since when has impossible
Ever stopped You
Friday's disappointment
Is Sunday's empty tomb
Since when has impossible
Ever stopped You
[Chorus: Brandon Lake and Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
This is the sound of dry bones rattling
This is the praise make a dead man walk again
Open the grave, I'm coming out
I'm gonna live, gonna live again
This is the sound of dry bones rattling
Pentecostal fire stirring something new
You're not gonna run out of miracles anytime soon
Resurrection power runs in my veins too
I believe there's another miracle here in this room
[Chorus: Brandon Lake and Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
This is the sound of dry bones rattling
This is the praise make a dead man walk again
Open the grave, I'm coming out
I'm gonna live, gonna live again
This is the sound of dry bones rattling
Yeah, hey
I hear them rattle, ooh
