When you lift your hands up high
And you sing a song of praise to me
It brings me great delight
Such a lovely sight
And yes it is true
Praise looks good on you
Morning night and noon
Your praise ascends to heaven like
The smell of sweet perfume
Filling every room
And yes it is true
Praise looks good on you
You bring your sacrifices
And you offer up your praise
You lift your voice with singing
But your heart seems far away
More than a sacrifice
I am looking for your life
Holy and acceptable
And pleasing in my sight
So offer up your lifes
Holy and acceptable
A willing sacrifice
Precious in my sight
But in all that you do
Remember all I want is you
