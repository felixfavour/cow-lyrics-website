All of the world could drift away
The way things are going that could today but
There's a comfort in knowing that in spite of all things
I still have your grace, grace
Water and fire might consume it all
And the things put before you wouldn't have no value at all
So now I have a new prospective of what's important to me
I still want your grace
Because of your grace
Nothing is impossible with your grace
By this we are saved
What a blessing for the righteous
We have the gift of your grace
All of the world could drift away
The way things are going that could today but
There's a comfort in knowing that in spite of all things
I still have your grace, grace
Because of your grace
Nothing is impossible with your grace
By this we are saved
What a blessing for the righteous
We have the gift of your grace
Nothing is impossible with your grace
By this we are saved
What a blessing for the righteous
We have the gift of your grace
Your grace is my protection
Lord I'm safe in your sight
And when I'm wrong and need correction
Your Grace makes me right
I'll be unrecognizable without your grace in my life
Lord I want more
I want more of your grace
