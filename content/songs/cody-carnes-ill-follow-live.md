"I'll Follow"
You are the light of the world
Who else could lead me
You have the words of life
Who else would I follow
You are the living well
For all who are thirsty
You invite me to journey with You
And I say "Yes"
Your word is a lamp to my feet
I'll follow wherever You lead
You're the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Your spirit is lighting my path
I'll follow, there's no turning back
You're the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
If it's the wilderness
I know You'll lead me through it
If it's the promised land
I know You've led me to it
You invite me to journey with You
And I say "Yes"
Your word is a lamp to my feet
I'll follow wherever You lead
You're the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Your spirit is lighting my path
I'll follow, there's no turning back
You're the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Your word
Your word is a lamp to my feet
I'll follow wherever You lead
You're the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Your spirit is lighting my path
I'll follow, there's no turning back
You're the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
I'll follow
I'll follow
Cloud by day or fire by night
Either way You're by my side
Jehovah never fails
Jehovah never fails
Wilderness or promised land
Either way I'm in Your hand
Jehovah never fails
Jehovah never fails
Cloud by day or fire by night
Either way You're by my side
Jehovah never fails
Jehovah never fails
Wilderness or promised land
Either way I'm in Your hand
Jehovah never fails
Jehovah never fails
Cloud by day or fire by night
Either way You're by my side
Jehovah never fails
Jehovah never fails
Wilderness or promised land
Either way I'm in Your hand
Jehovah never fails
Jehovah never fails
However You lead
Wherever You lead
Cloud by day or fire by night
Either way You're by my side
Jehovah never fails
Jehovah never fails
Wilderness or promised land
Either way I'm in Your hand
Jehovah never fails
Sing you all
Your word is a lamp to my feet
I'll follow wherever You lead
You're the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Your spirit is lighting my path
I'll follow, there's no turning back
You're the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Your word is a lamp to my feet
I'll follow wherever You lead
You're the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Your spirit is lighting my path
I'll follow, there's no turning back
You're the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Wherever You lead I'll follow
Wherever You lead I'll follow
I'm always Yours
I'm Yours forever
Wherever You lead I'll follow
Wherever You lead I'll follow
