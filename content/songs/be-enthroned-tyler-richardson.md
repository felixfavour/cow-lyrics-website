We have come to bring an offering
We have come to worship
Making You a place of dwelling
Be seated on our worship
[Chorus: Tyler Richardson]
Be enthroned
On our praises here, O Lord
Be enthroned
And fill this place we're in with Your
Your glory
Your glory
We have come to bring an offering
We have come to worship
Making You a place of dwelling
Be seated on our worship
[Chorus: William McDowell, 
William McDowell & Tyler Richardson
, 
Tyler Richardson
]
Be enthroned
On our praises here, O Lord
Be enthroned
Fill this place we're in with Your (
Oh, with You alone
)
Be enthroned
On our praises here, O Lord
Be enthroned
Fill this place we're in with Your glory, oh
We need You
