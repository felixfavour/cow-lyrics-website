You appoint kings and kingdom
You give strength to the powerful
You give wisdom to the wisest
You can do anything

Your name can be called on
by anyone who believes
And they will be saved
You are greater than words can say

Oh how marvelous
Are Your works oh God
Oh How wonderful
To sing of Your Greatness

God Almighty
Awesome in power
Our song of praise to You
Will never end

Almighty You are
Youâ€™re so kind
All powerful You are
And so gracious

So great You are
Yet You live in us
Our song of praise to You
Will never end

Oh how marvellous
Are Your works oh God
Oh How wonderful
To sing of Your Greatness

God Almighty
Awesome in power
Our song of praise to You
Will never end
