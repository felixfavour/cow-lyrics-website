We thirst for Your presence
Send down Your rain
Here in this moment, a holy embrace
Fire of Heaven
Come surround (Surround)
We bow down in reverence on this holy ground
Spirit of God, fall upon this place
Fan every heart into a burning flame
We long for You, call upon Your name
Spirit of God
Have Your way, hmm
Have Your way, hmm
Oh, have Your-, hmm
Hmm
Nothing between us
The veil is torn
You're calling us closer, we'll run to You, Lord
Spirit of God, fall upon this place
Fan every heart into a burning flame
We long for You, call upon Your name
Spirit of God
Have Your way, hmm
Yeah, have Your-, hmm
