Lord of all creation
Of water earth and sky
The heavens are Your Tabernacle
Glory to the Lord on high
God of wonders beyond our galaxy
You are Holy, Holy
The universe declares Your Majesty
And You are holy holy
Lord of Heaven and Earth
Lord of Heaven and Earth
Early in the morning
I will celebrate the light
When I stumble in the darkness
I will call Your name by night
God of wonders beyond our galaxy
You are Holy, Holy
The universe declares Your Majesty
And You are holy holy
Lord of heaven and earth
Lord of heaven and earth
