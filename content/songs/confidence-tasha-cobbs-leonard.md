I got so much faith in You, Lord I trust your word it's true
No matter the circumstance, my life is in your hands
I've got confidence, so much confidence, in you
Your love has been so good to me, it's so unfailing
My heart is in your hands, you hold the master plan
I've got confidence, so much confidence in you
I've got confidence, so much confidence in you
Your Ways are
Higher, and Your thoughts are Deeper, So much deeper i can't even imagine
How you do what you do, but you do what you do
I've got confidence, so much confidence in you
Again.... i know He will...He will
