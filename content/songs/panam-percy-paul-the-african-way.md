is is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice and be glad in it
The joy of the Lord has become our strength
We will rejoice and be glad
Be glad in it
This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice and be glad in it
The joy of the Lord has become our strength
We will rejoice and be glad
Be glad in it
Arise and shine children of Africa
What was hid from all eyes has been revealed to You
The mystery of the Godhead
The perfect blood sacrifice
The most powerful Spirit
Behind the words of our covenant
This day we have found our inheritance with the tribe of Judah
This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice and be glad in it
The joy of the Lord has become our strength
We will rejoice and be glad
Be glad in it
We have been chosen by the hands of the Almighty
Instrument of praise and show the purity of worship
Though we went astray and worship other deities
But today today (Today today)
We take our place and we worship the God of eternity
This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice and be glad in it
The joy of the Lord has become our strength
We will rejoice and be glad
Be glad in it
Let us come let us come (Come now)
To the God of all creation (Lift high)
Give Him all the adoration (We will love)
And we will serve Him
Eternally
This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice and be glad in it
The joy of the Lord has become our strength
We will rejoice and be glad
Be glad in it
We will rejoice and be glad
We must rejoice and be glad in it
We must rejoice and be glad
Be glad in it
We must rejoice and be glad
Be glad in it
We must rejoice and be glad
Be glad in it
We must rejoice and be glad
Be glad in it
This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice and be glad in it
The joy of the Lord has become our strength
We will rejoice and be glad
Be glad in it
