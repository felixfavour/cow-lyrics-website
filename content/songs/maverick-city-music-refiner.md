If the altar's where you meet us
Take me there, take me there
If you're looking for an offering
It's right here, my life is here
I'll be a living sacrifice for you
Pre chorus
You're a fire
The refiner
I wanna be consumed
Chorus
I wanna be tried by fire
Purified
You take whatever you desire
Lord here's my life
Verse 2
If your glory wants to come in
Let it fall, we want it all
Lord your fire is consuming
Fill this place, set it ablaze
I'll be a living sacrifice for you
Pre chorus
You're a fire
The refiner
I wanna be consumed
Chorus
I wanna be tried by fire
Purified
You take whatever you desire
Lord here's my life
Clean my hands, purify my heart
I wanna burn for you, only for You
Take my life as a sacrifice
I wanna burn for you, only for You
