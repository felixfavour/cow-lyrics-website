Precious cornerstone, sure foundation
You are faithful to the end
We are waiting, on you, jesus
We believe you're all to us [x2]
Let the glory of your name be the passion of the church
Let the righteousness of god be a holy flame that burns
Let the saving love of christ be the measure of our lives
We believe you're all to us
Only son of god sent from heaven
Hope and mercy at the cross
You are everything, you're the promise
Jesus, you are all to us
[Chorus][x2]
[Bridge]
You're all to us [x3]
Yes, you are
[Outro]
When this passing world is over
We will see you face to face
And forever we will worship
Jesus, you are all to us
