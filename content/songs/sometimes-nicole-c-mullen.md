Sometimes, sometimes I'm just
Runnin' so fast that i can't touch the ground
I'm spinning faster than an merry go round
I find myself in the lost and found
And sometimes, sometimes I'm just
Callin' your name and I don't know why
Holdin' my head and cryin' "my oh my"
Up and Down like the tide
But you're the
Same Yesterday, and tomorrow won't change all your
Excellent ways
I said you're the
Same yesterday, and tomorrow won't change all your
Excellent ways
'Cause Sometimes, sometimes I'm just

Everything goes like I planned it
Hold that though while I get candid
Sometimes, sometimes I jump
Outta of the pan, into the fire
Get my foot stuck in the mire
Lord you must get tired but you're the
