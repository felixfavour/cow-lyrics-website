I was born on a rock in the middle of the ocean
Where the wind's so rough it can carry you to London
It's a new found land with an old soul reaching
For the light of day
My parents gave me a life full of dreams
Yeah, they gave me a heart to endure most anything
But everyone gets a broken pair of wings
And if you try to fly you'll fail
But a voice said, "Lift up your head"And my heart burst out of my chest
I woke up in America for the love of God
I woke up in America for something bigger than myself
More than fireworks and fanfare, more than a star-spangled banner
You're still beautiful, America
Yeah, it's late in the night and I look in the mirror
Count the lines on my face and wonder how they got there
Oh but every one's a story of how grace appeared
And carried me through the day
And the voice said, "This land ain't dead"You still got better days up ahead
