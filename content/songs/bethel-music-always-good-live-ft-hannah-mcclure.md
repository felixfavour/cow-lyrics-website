You meet me on the mountain top
You see me in the valley low
There is no home without You here
I find You in the crowded thoughts
You quiet all the question marks
There is no space Your love won't fill
I'll trade all my fear for peace of mind
All my heaviness for burdens light
And this will be my song
That You are always good
I'll sing it all day long
That You are always good
And when the day is through, I am left with
You are always, You are always good
I set my eyes on perfect faith
You'll finish what You start in me
My heart will be an offering
I'll trade all my fear for peace of mind
All my heaviness, my burden's light
This will be my song
That You are always good
I'll sing it all day long
That You are always good
When the day is through, I am left with
You are always, You are always
Every melody
You're singing back to me
You're singing back
Every melody
You're singing back to me
You're singing back
Every melody
You're singing back to me
You're singing back
Every melody
You're singing back to me
You're singing back
I traded all my fear for peace of mind
You took heaviness, my burden's light
And this will be my song
That You are always good
I'll sing it all day long (I'll sing all day long)
That You are always good
And when the day is through, I am left with
You are always, You are always good
