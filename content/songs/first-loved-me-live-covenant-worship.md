[Instrumental]
I can't forget, I still remember
The place You found me and I surrendered
When Your grace covered my shame and saw my need
You gave me hope, hope and a future
My heart is Yours, now and forever
I am loved only because You first loved me
And I love You, Jesus, I love You
Yes, I love You because You first loved me
Your sacrifice is overwhelming
Suffered and died because You love me
Now I'm alive only through Christ who first loved me
And I love You, Jesus, I love You
Yes, I love You because You first loved me
And I love You, Jesus, I love You
Yes, I love You because You first loved me
