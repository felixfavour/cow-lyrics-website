Do you know your wealth
More than diamonds hiding on a shelf
Do you know who you are
God has made you a shining star
I've got a little friend
Her age is 4 plus ten
She calls me on the phone crying every
Now and then
She says, "My mamma just won't listen
My daddy still is missin'
I dont feel i am nothing of value or worth"
I say, "Baby girl get a hold of yourself
Baby girl don't you know your wealth
You're a diamond hiding on a shelf
Baby girl, baby girl
Baby girl dont you know who you are
God has made you a shining star
A little light is brighter than the dark
Baby girl, baby girl"
I call my sister friend
I'm crying and whining again
She lets me vent my heart
Before the healing starts
And i say my children just won't listen
My paycheck still is missin'
And every little thing is working my nerve
