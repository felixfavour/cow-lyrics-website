Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, your faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You've never failed me yet
I've seen You move,
You move the mountains
And I believe, I'll see You do it again
You made a way, where there was no way
And I believe, I'll see You do it again!...
I've seen You
I've seen You move,
You move the mountains
And I believe, I'll see You do it again
You made a way, where there was no way
And I believe, I'll see You do it again
I've seen You move,
I've seen You move,
You move the mountains
And I believe,
And I believe,
I'll see You do it
I'll see You do it again
You made a way,
You made a way,
Where there was no way
Where there was no way
And I believe,
I'll see You do it again
Late in the midnight hour
God's gonna turn it around
It's gonna work in your favour
If you believe it sing it with me now
Late in the midnight hour
God's gonna turn it around
It's gonna work in your favour
Late in the midnight hour
God's gonna turn it around
It's gonna work in your favour
Late in the midnight hour
God's gonna turn it around
It's gonna work in your favour

Late in the midnight hour
God's gonna turn it around
It's gonna work in your favour
Late in the midnight hour
God's gonna turn it around
It's gonna work in your favour
Late in the midnight hour
God's gonna turn it around
It's gonna work in your favour
Ooo...
Late in the midnight hour
Late in the midnight hour
Late in the midnight hour
Late in the midnight hour
God's gonna turn it around
God's gonna turn it around
God's gonna turn it around
God's gonna turn it around
It's gonna work...
It's gonna work...
It's gonna work...
It's gonna work...
I've seen Him move,
You move the mountains
And I believe, I'll see You do it again...
End.....
