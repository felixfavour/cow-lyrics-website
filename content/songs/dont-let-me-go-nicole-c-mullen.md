Hey...
Please don't let me go
Many times I've strayed from Your love for me
In those times I thought that I couldn't be
Like You said, You'd never say the word "goodbye"
Still, I'd leave, and deep inside You'd cry
I'm back for good this time, I'm back to stay
(I'm back to stay, I'm back for good)
If You'll receive me and not turn away
(And not turn me away)
I don't deserve it, but I need to know
(But I need to know, I need to know)
That You will keep me and never let me go
(Keep me, never, never let me go)
Don't let me go
Can't You hear me call
Don't let me go
Catch me when I'm fallin'
Don't let me go
(Won't you keep my head)
Keep my head from turnin'
Don't let me go
Whoa, hey, yeah
