In case you have fallen by the wayside of life
Dreams and visions shattered
You are broken inside
You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in
The potter wants to put you back together again
In case your situation has turned upside down
And all that you've accomplished
Is now on the ground
You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in (oh)
The potter wants to put you back together again
Oh, the potter wants to put you back together again
In case you have fallen by the wayside of life
Dreams and visions shattered
You are broken inside
You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in
The potter wants to put you back together again
In case your situation has turned upside down
And all that you've accomplished
Is now on the ground
You don't have to stay in the shape that you're in (oh)
The potter wants to put you back together again
Oh, the potter wants to put you back together again
You who are broken, (you who are broken)
Stop by (why don't you stop by) the potter's house
You who demanded, (you who demanded)
Stop by (stop by) the potter's house
Give him the fragments of your broken life
(Oh-oh-oh)
You who are broken, (if you are broken) stop by the potter's house
You who demanded, stop by the potter's house
Give him the fragments of your broken life
My friend, the potter wants
To put you back together again
Oh, the potter wants
To put you back together again
There's joy (joy) in the potter's house (in the potter's house)
There's no reason to be sad for there's joy (joy)
In the potter's house
If you are looking for peace
Peace in the potter's house
Peace in the potter's house
Is there anybody in here that needs love?
Love in the potter's house
Love in the potter's house
Salvation
Salvation in the potter's house
Healing in the potter's house
There is deliverance
Deliverance in the potter's house
Deliverance in the potter's house
Everything you need in the potter's house
Everything you need in the potter's house
Everything you need in the potter's house
Everything you need in the potter's house
The potter wants to put you back together again
Oh, the potter wants
To put you back together again
