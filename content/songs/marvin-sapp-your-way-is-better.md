"Your Way Is Better"
I will keep chasing after the Father first
I know He'll always take care of me
No matter how much I think it's worth
I won't forget what He promised me
'Cause everything He has is better
It's so much better
Trusting You is better
Better than anything
So I will keep chasing after the Father first
I know He'll always take care of me
(No matter how much)
No matter how much I think it's worth
I won't forget what He promised me
(Everything You have)
So everything You have is better
(So much better) It's so much better
(Trusting You) Trusting You is better
Better than what I see
Anything that I feel
Everything that I want
Your way is better (Your way is better)
Better than what I see
Anything that I feel
Everything that I want
Your way is better (Your way is better)
(Better than) Better than anything
(So I'll keep chasing) So I will keep chasing after the Father first
I won't forget what You've done for me
(No I won't, no I won't)
No matter how much I think it's worth
(I won't forget everything You promised)
I know you'll always take care of me
