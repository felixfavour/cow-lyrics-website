Habakkuk 2:14 
For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea. 

We decree multiple harvests of souls, finances, partnerships, and resources for the spread of Rhapsody of Realities to the ends of the earth. The earth is yielding its increase, and every seed sown produces bountifully in righteousness. Nations, cities, and communities are opened up for the Gospel, and Your Word prevails mightily. We thank You, Lord, because the harvest is unstoppable, and it continues to multiply exceedingly, beyond our expectations, to Your glory. Hallelujah
