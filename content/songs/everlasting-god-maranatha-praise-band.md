Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord
We wait upon the Lord
We wait upon the Lord
Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord
We wait upon the Lord
We wait upon the Lord
Our God, You reign for ever
Our hope, Our strong deliverer
You are the everlasting God
The everlasting God
You do not faint, You won't grow weary
You're the defender of the weak
You comfort those in need
You lift us up on wings like eagles
Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord...
