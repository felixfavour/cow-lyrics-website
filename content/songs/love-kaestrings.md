I'm not worthy of your love
You showered me with blessings from above
Nothing I will do will ever make me worthy of you
But you love me anyway
When I tried to leave you said my child stay,
What did i do to deserve your love, what did I do
Chorus
Me na yi da ka so ni haka x3 (what have i done to deserve this love)
Abin da ya fi godiya shi ne zan baka. (any thing i get more than a heart of gratitude is what i will offer)
And i fall some times
Wonder why I'm on this earth in the first place,
But then i look to the sky and cry adonai and you still answer my call.
I say sorry all the time,
And still go back to the crime,
But you love me any way,
You love me any way,
what did i do to deserve your Love,
what did i do to deserve your love,
coz nothing i will ever do will make me worthy of you,
me na yi, me na yi, me nayi o o o o
Chorus
Me na yi da ka so ni haka x3
Abin da ya fi godiya shi ne zan baka x2

Rayuwa Rayuwa ta na baka x2 (i offer my life)
Sujada sujada ta na baka x 2 ( i offer my worship)
Hada godiya, godiya ta na baka x2 ( i offer my gratitude)
