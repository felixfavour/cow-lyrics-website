Of the Father's love begotten
'Ere the world began to be
He the source of all that has been
And all the future years will see
Evermore, evermore
He shall reign forevermore
Humble King, Sovereign Lord
He shall reign forevermore
Oh, that birth forever blessed
When and the chosen Virgin go
By the Holy Ghost conceiving
Bore the Savior of our world
Evermore, evermore
He shall reign forevermore
Humble King, Sovereign Lord
He shall reign forevermore
[Bridge]
He is found in human fashion
Death and sorrow here to know
That the race of Adam's Children
Doomed by law to endless woe
Need not henceforth die and perish
In the dreadful gulf below
But forever rest in beauty
In the lights of Heaven's glow
