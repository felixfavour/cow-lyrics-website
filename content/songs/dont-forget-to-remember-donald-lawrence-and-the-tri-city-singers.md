Don't forget to remember where your blessings come from
Don't forget to give honour where honour is due
Don't forget to give thanks to the One who put you there
Don't forget where your blessings come from
When you get a little money
Get up on your feet
Why do we change?
Get a little fortune and fame
Sign a title to your name
Why do we change?
Just like the ten in the Bible days
Who were blessed by the Lord
And went on their way
Except one came back with gratitude
We've got to give honour where it is due
Where all our blessings
Where all our blessings
Where all our blessings come from
Always remember Jesus, Jesus
Always keep Him on your mind
