I just want to make Jesus proud
I just want to make Jesus proud
Yes and
I would stop at nothing
And I would lay down anything
Just to see my Jesus proud
I just want to make Jesus proud
I just want to make Jesus proud
Yes and
I would stop at nothing
And I would lay down anyone
Just to see my Jesus proud
I'd make him proud of me
Make him proud of me
Yes and
I would stop at nothing
And I would lay down anyone
Just to see my Jesus proud
I'd make him proud of me
Make him proud of me
Yes and
I would stop at nothing
And I would lay down anyone
Just to see my Jesus proud
