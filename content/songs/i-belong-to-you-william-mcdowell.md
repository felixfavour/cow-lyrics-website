I've been captured by a love I can't explain
And now you have me and I'm forever changed
I've abandoned everything I've ever known
Now I surrender my life is not my own
I belong to you I belong to you
I belong to you I belong to you
I've been captured by a love I can't explain
And now you have me and I'm forever changed
I've abandoned everything I've ever known
I surrender my life is not my own
I belong to you I belong to you
I belong to you I belong to you
My life is not my own to you I belong
I give myself I give myself to you
My life is not my own to you I belong
I give myself I give myself to you
My life is not my own to you I belong
I give myself I give myself to you
