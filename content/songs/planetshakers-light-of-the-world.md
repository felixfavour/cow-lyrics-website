Years ago, in the darkness of the night
There was a glow, the radiance of a light
Led to the One, the one and only Son
For unto us a child is born, He will be called-
Wonderful, Mighty God, Prince of Peace
You are the light of the world, shining brighter than the sun
You are the light of the world, Jesus, Jesus
You bring life to the world, You're the joy of everyone
You bring life to the world, Jesus, Jesus
From the very start, You were the brightest star
There was nothing that could stop You, from letting all Your love shine through
From the beginning to the very end, when You come down when You ascend
You will always be the greatest, You will always shine the brightest
Wonderful (Wonderful)
Mighty God (Mighty God)
Prince of Peace
You are the light of the world, shining brighter than the sun
You are the light of the world, Jesus, Jesus
(You bring life, yeah) You bring life to the world
You're the joy of everyone
You bring life to the world
Jesus, Jesus (Jesus, You bring me life, yeah)
You are the light of the world, Jesus
It feels real good
'Cause You are wonderful
You are Mighty God (Yes, You are)
Prince of Peace (You are the Prince of Peace, yeah)
You are the light of the world, shining brighter than the sun
You are the light of the world, Jesus, Jesus
You bring life to the world, You're the joy of everyone
You bring life to the world, Jesus, Jesus (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, wooh, huh)
It feels real good
Yeah, yeah
