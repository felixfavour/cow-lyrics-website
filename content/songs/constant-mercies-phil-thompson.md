At the dawn of morning, mercies are falling
And the shadow of Your goodness follows me
In my darkest valleys, when evil surrounds me
I will not fear, Your presence is here, it's over me
Constant mercies unrestrained
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your grace, great is Your grace
Unabandoned, new each day
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your grace, great is Your grace
At the dawn of morning
(Say mercies are falling) Mercies are falling
(As Your grace) As Your grace and mercy rest upon my heart
(When my heart is racing) When my heart is racing
(And doubt overtakes me) And doubt overtakes me
(Say I will not fear) I will not fear, Your presence is here over me
(Say I will not fear) I will not fear, (Say) Your presence is here over me
Constant mercies unrestrained
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your grace, great is Your grace
Unabandoned, new each day
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your grace, great is Your grace
