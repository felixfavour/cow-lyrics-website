You with a friend, someone you know, cry through the night
(Cry through the night)
Someone is lost, stuck in the dirt, buried alive
(Buried alive)
Or maybe someone who wrapped in a dream is livin' a lie
(Hallelujah)
This is for them, immigrant, alien, native, or not
(Come on)
Remember the pain, all of the sorrow, all of the fights (Yes, sir)
Too many times, too many trials
Too many days, too many nights
The person who's workin', workin' their hardest
On their last dime and feelin' impartial (Let's go)
Nothing can stop you (Nothing can stop you)
The weapon against you, it will not prosper (It won't prosper)
If you're lookin' for healing, you can find healing (Healing)
Down at the chapel, down at the chapel
[Chorus: New Direction + (Kirk Franklin)]
This ain't no accident (Haha, yes)
No coincidence (Hallelujah)
This feels like victory (Feels like victory)
This feels like Church to me (Woo!)
This ain't no accident (Listen)
No coincidence (C'mon, c'mon)
This feels like victory (It feels like victory)
This feels like Church to me (Don't it feel like Church, now?)
