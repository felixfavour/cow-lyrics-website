Back when I was seventeen
Like every other girl, I used to have big dreams
But then I got introduced to some other things...
And suddenly the church girl I was originally
Became different
See the wrong things can call your name
I chose to answer when the Spirit said "walk away"And now I live with circumstances that I can't erase
I just wish I could go back now to yesterday
'Cause it was different
[Pre-Chorus]
But there's not a hole too deep, naw
That God won't reach down and save me, me
See He cleaned me up and made me new
Said welcome back and now I'm standing here in front of you, hey!
I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met the Savior
See my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away
Now I'm different
See I'm different
Y'all I'm not the same
Ever since I met King Jesus
Now my life has changed
I must admit back in the day I did some crazy things
But that's my past
See my past has now passed away
'Cause I'm different
