You are welcome in this place
Welcome in our hearts
Come and have your way
God, meet us face to face
All consuming fire
Move without restraint
Breathe on us
Spirit, come
You're our heart's desire
We stand in the glory of the King
Knowing that you're here
You have set us free
You're here
Let our worship be Your throne
Amazed by who You are
Your Presence makes us whole
[Chorus: Kari Jobe]
Lеt the Heavens opеn
Let Your Kingdom move
All our faith and hope in our great God
Let the Heavens open
Let Your Kingdom move
All our faith and hope in our great God
Let the Heavens open
Let Your Kingdom move
All our faith and hope in our great God
Let the Heavens open
Let Your Kingdom move
All our faith and hope in our great God
