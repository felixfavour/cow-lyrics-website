I won't even try to tell it all
But God knows, yeah, He knows
There is a story behind every scar
That God knows, yeah, He knows
'Cause when all the doors were closing, He made a way
And He's done so much for me that my words can't say
If you notice something different in how I praise
Well
Only God knows (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
You may not know but (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
I can't even tell it (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
I won't explain but (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
You're probably wondering how you made it this far
Ey, God knows, yeah, He knows, and
What it took to be the person you are
Well, God knows, yeah, He knows
'Cause when all the doors were closing, He made a way
And He's been so good to you that your words can't say
And you can't help but be different in how you praise
Only God knows (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
Your testimony (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
The details of your story (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
Thank God for what (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-hey, la-hey
La-la-la-la-la, sing it with me, say
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-hey, la-hey
La-la-la-la-la, hey, hey
Thank the Lord
I gotta thank the Lord
You better thank the Lord
For all the things that
Only (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
The things that only (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
All He's done for you (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
All He's brought you through (He knows)
He knows (He knows)
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-hey, la-hey
(Yeah I thank Him for it, Yeah I thank Him for it)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
(Yeah I love Him for it, Yeah I love Him for it)
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-hey, la-hey
(And I praise Him for it, yeah I praise Him for it)
La-la-la-la-la (For all the things that He knows)
