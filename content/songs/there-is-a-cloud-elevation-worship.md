Hear the word roaring as thunder
With a new future to tell
For the dry season is over
There is a cloud beginning to swell
To the skies heavy with blessing
Lift your eyes, offer your heart
Jesus Christ opened the heavens
Now we receive the Spirit of God
We receive Your rain
We receive Your rain
Every seed buried in sorrow
You will call forth in its time
You are Lord, Lord of the harvest
Calling our hope now to arise
We receive Your rain
We receive Your rain
We receive Your rain
We receive Your rain
