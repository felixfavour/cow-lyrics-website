My Jasmine, you're so beautiful to me
My Jasmine, more than a billion dollar ring
I'm so glad God gave you to me
Sleepy angel face of peace
I'm so glad God gave you to me
Now close your eyes and go to sleep
And goodnight, goodnight
May God keep you and hold you tight
Goodnight, goodnight
My baby love goodnight
Max Ryan Josiah, mama's precious little boys
Max, Ryan, Josiah you always bring me so much joy
I'm so glad God gave you to me
Sleepy angels face of peace
I'm so glad God gave you to me
Now close your eyes and go to sleep
And goodnight, goodnight
May God keep you and hold you tight
Goodnight, goodnight
My baby love goodnight
