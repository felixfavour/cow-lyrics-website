Chorus:
Everybody put your hands together and let's praise the Lord (3x)
The earth is His, the seas are His
The lands are His, our hands are His
Put your hands together and let's praise the Lord
Clap your hands all ye people
Sing praise to the Lord
Shout unto God with shouts of joy for He is Lord
(Chorus)
For God is King of heaven and earth
And He shall reign forevermore
Bridge:
Come on, let's put our hands together
And sing our praises unto our Lord (4x)
For God is King of heaven and earth
And He shall reign forevermore
For God is King of heaven and earth
And He shall reign forevermore
