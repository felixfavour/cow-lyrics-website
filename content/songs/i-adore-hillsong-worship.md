The universe is at Your feet
Gives You praise evermore
The stars will light the sky for You
Always God be praised
And we sing, "The Lord is on high, the Lord is on high"I adore You, I adore You
And there's none that compares to Your majesty, oh, Lord
I adore You, I adore You
And I stand in the wonder of Your love
The universe is at Your feet
Gives You praise evermore
The stars will light the sky for You
Always God be praised
And we sing, "The Lord is on high, the Lord is on high"I adore You, I adore You
And there's none that compares to Your majesty, oh, Lord
I adore You, I adore You
And I stand in the wonder of Your love
