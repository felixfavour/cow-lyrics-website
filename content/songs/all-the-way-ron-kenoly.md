The day I chose to give my life to You
Is the day that everything began to change
The problems that I faced were getting stronger
I thought when I got saved
My problems would go away
But the change I made
Began to really take a toll on me
And when I told my friends about You Lord
They laughed hysterically
But no matter what they say
Or what they choose to think of me
I'm gonna stay here strong
For You my Lord
No matter what the cost might be
I'm gonna serve You
Because I love You
I'm going with You
All the way
If friends forsake me
I won't let it break me
I'm going with You
All the way
All the way
