What's the use of the Sun
If the Earth can't feel the Glow
If it couldn't make Flowers Grow
It wouldn't be a Wonder
It wouldn't be a Miracle
And what's the use of the Sea
If the Waters didn't Flow
If hid all of its Life
It wouldn't be a Miracle
I Look Right at you
Let me tell you what you are
You're a Miracle
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
You're a Miracle
Ooh Ooh
Look what the Lord has done
Look what the Lord has done
Look what the Lord has done
Ooh Ooh Ooh
And what's the use of that Voice
If the World can't Hear your Song
If your Mouth is always Closed
You'll never be a Wonder
You'll never be a Miracle
And what's the use of that Life
Is no One Sees you Love
You'll just be a Bag
Of Blood and Bone
And you'll never see a Miracle
Tonight
I'm Looking Right at you
Let me tell you what you are
You're a Miracle
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
You're a Miracle

Look what the Lord has done
Look what the Lord has done
