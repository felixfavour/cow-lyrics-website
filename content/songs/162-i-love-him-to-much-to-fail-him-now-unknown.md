When I first heard of Jesus, His love and His grace, my heart was overwhelmed to think a King would take my place. I cried, "Lord I'll go with you every step of the way; that's all I can do my debt to repay.

I love Him too much to fail Him now. Too much to break my vow! For I promised the Lord that I would make it somehow, and now I love Him too much to fail Him now. 

When I told Him I loved Him, it was easy to say. But harder to prove it when temptation came my way; for what good are broken promises, I counted then but loss. When I caught a glimpse of true love hanging on a rugged cross. 

I love Him too much to fail Him now. Too much to break my vow! For I promised the Lord that I would make it somehow, and now I love Him too much to fail Him now. 

Oh, the years have drawn us closer, my love for Him has grown. Each step has brought me nearer to my eternal home; and I'm just too close to Heaven to turn back now. His grace will be sufficient, I'm gonna make it somehow!

I love Him too much to fail Him now. Too much to break my vow! For I promised the Lord that I would make it somehow, and now I love Him too much to fail Him now.
