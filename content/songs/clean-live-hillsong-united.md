Precious blood has left me forgiven
Pure like the whitest of snow
Powerful to make sin and shame retreat
This covenant is making me whole
So I will rise and lift my head
For by His mercy my life was spared
The highest name has set me free
Because of Jesus
My heart is clean
Purify my heart in Your presence
Teach me to discover the joy
Of holiness that forms as You draw me close
In You what was lost is restored
So I will rise and lift my head
For by His mercy my life was spared
The highest name has set me free
Because of Jesus
My heart is clean
