On a shameful day He died
In the sorrow of defeat
But forgiveness was His cry
As His blood ran down for me
How the Father's heart was torn
As His only son was slain
But the earth would soon rejoice
From the place where hope was lain
For the Lamb has overcome
Everlasting love has won
In eternal praise we will lift Him up
For the Lamb has overcome the world
By His spirit we are raised
To the fullness of new life
In a moment we'll be changed
And forever glorified
For the Lamb has overcome
Everlasting love has won
In eternal praise we will lift Him up
For the Lamb has overcome the world
