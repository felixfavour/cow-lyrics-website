This is the day, that You have made
Whatever comes, I won't complain
For all my hope, is in Your name
And now Your joy, awaits my praise
I give thanks, for all You have done
And I will sing, of Your mercy and Your love
Your love is unfailing
Lord, I am grateful!
When I was down, You brought me out
You set my feet, on higher ground
So here I stand, You are my God
Your faithfulness, my Solid Rock
I give thanks, for all You have done
And I will sing, of Your mercy and Your love
Your love is unfailing
Lord, I am grateful
I give thanks, for all You have done
I won't forget, all the battles You have won
Your love is unfailing
Lord, I am grateful!
