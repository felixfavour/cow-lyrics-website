[Instrumental]
No shame, no fear
No more condemnation
Freedom, is here
Our hope and our salvation
No name, compares
No love that is greater
Jesus, is here
Our God cannot be shaken
Oh-ohhh
Take heart, the Light has come
Take heart, our God is for us
We stand in the Savior's love
The only love that will last forever
No sin, too great
Nothing that He can't conquer
His love, remains
Our God is so much stronger
Oh-ohh, oh-oh-oh-ohhh
