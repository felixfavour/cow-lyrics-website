Before I spoke a word
You were singing over me
You have been so, so
Good to me
Before I took a breath
You breathed your life in me
You have been so, so
Kind to me
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the 99
I couldn't earn it
I don't deserve it
Still you give yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
When 
I was your foe
Still your love fought for me
You have been so, so
Good to me
When I felt no worth
You paid it all for me
You have been so, so
Kind to me
