I know that you don't feel your best
Hold on be strong
God's not forgotten you
Broken dreams got you feeling blue
Hold on be strong
God's looking out for you
Just remember at the end of the day
The favor of god can open the way
God's favor is more precious than life
God's favor more precious than life to me
I know that you don't feel up to the fight
Hold on be strong
The battle is not up to you
Oh I hear you say it just ain't no way
Hold on be strong
God's got the final say
Just remember in the midst of your doubt
The favor of god can turn things around
God's favor more precious than life
God's favor more precious than life to me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
So what if doors are closed
God's favor can bring high places down
I know that you've been faithful
God will remember when others forget
And when god get's ready to bless you
There's nothing no man can do
God's favor is more precious
God's favor favor  favor  favor God's favor favor
God's favor  favor  favor  favor
Is more precious repeat
