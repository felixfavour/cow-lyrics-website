Toya Eze, Toya
You made the Lame man walk
You made the blind man See
Toya Eze, Toya
You made the dead man RISE
Walked upon the SEA
Toya Eze, Toya
If you did it before
You can do it TODAY
Toya Eze, Toya
Agu Nech'nma One
(The Lion that keeps the city)
Ebube Dike, Ekwueme
(King of Glory, Promise Keeper)
So I lift my hands
To give you all my PRAISE
Toya Eze, Toya
