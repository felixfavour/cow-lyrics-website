You have all that it takes to be what you desire
You can't afford to be weak, lukewarm or quiet
He said occupy till I come, you've got the power to do all things
Occupy till I come, as He is so you are in this world (Oh)
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Lean not on your own understanding
In all Your ways acknowledge Him
And He shall direct your path
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Lean not on your own understanding
In all Your ways acknowledge Him
And He shall direct your path (Oh)
Christ is the vine, we are the branches
He who abides in Him bears morе fruit
He is the way, the truth and thе life
Your maker, provider, supplier and everything
Even when things don't make sense
In all Your ways acknowledge him still
Even when things don't make sense
In all Your ways acknowledge him
