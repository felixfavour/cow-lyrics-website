LET EVERYTHING THAT HAS BREATH
(Psalm 150, 6)
Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
And let the
Living proclaim
Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
(Repeat)
Let every instrument
Sound His praise
As all His people adore
Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
I will open up my mouth
And He will fill it with praise
I will magnify His name
The name that stands
Above all names is Jesus
(Repeat fist chorus)
High sounding cymbals
And trumpets of brass
The sound of one accord
Let everything
That has breath
Praise the Lord
My Lord has put
A new song in my heart
It's a song of praise to my God
And everyone who
Hears it will rejoice
(Repeat the chorus)
Let everything
That has breath
(Repeat 9 times)
Praise the Lord
