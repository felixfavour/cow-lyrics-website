Your Word shows
How much You have loved me
Sending love to find me
Reaching to my heart
Now I see
Lettered love has found me
Littered red with mercy
Written in your scars, Jesus
So have this broken heart
And show me what love paid for
Oh Lord, let my heart beat with Yours
This lettered love
Is shaping my story
[Tag]
All for the praise of Your Name
All for the fame of Your glory
Jesus be all that I seek
Your presence is all that I need
[Bridge]
Like the sun and moon
Like the night and noon
Your Word is light to me
And I’ll praise You
Splitting death and life
Like the earth and sky
Your Word is light in me
And I’ll praise You
