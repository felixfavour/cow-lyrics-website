Simply beautiful, beautiful
Simply beautiful, beautiful
Simply beautiful, beautiful
Simply beautiful, beautiful
Hey girl you're simply beautiful
And your frame is wonderful
Whether 35 or size 2
From you hair down to your baby toe
God has made you valuable
Can't nobody rock it like you
All she wanted was for Bobby Green
To tell her once that she's a beauty queen
Like the models in the magazines but he never said so
All she wanted was to be a star
Hope to shine away the hidden scars
And the traces of a broken heart
Cause she really didn't now
Hey girl you're simply beautiful
And your frame is wonderful
Hey girl you're simply beautiful
And your frame is wonderful
Whether 35 or size 2
From you hair down to your baby toe
God has made you valuable
Can't nobody rock it like you
