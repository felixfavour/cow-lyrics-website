[Instrumental]
There's no darkness in Your eyes
There's no question in Your mind
God Almighty
God of mercy
There's no hiding from Your face
There's no striving in Your grace
God of mercy
God Almighty
Let there be light
Open the eyes of the blind
Purify our hearts in Your fire
Breathe in us we pray
Jesus have Your way
[Instrumental]
There's no borders in Your love
No division in Your heart
God of heaven
God of freedom
There's no taking back the cross
No regret in what it cost
God of freedom
God of heaven
