As high as the heavens
As deep as the oceans wide
As far as the eastest
From the west plus a trillion miles
Your love, your love, is greater still!
Your love, Your love, is greater still!
I've walked through the valleys
And I've seen the shadows form
I sang in the darkness
Til' victory turned once more
Your love, your love, is greater still!
Your love, Your love, is greater still!
I've been kissed by Judahs
Held tightly by herbs and scars
I've wrestled retention
Abandon to rise no more
