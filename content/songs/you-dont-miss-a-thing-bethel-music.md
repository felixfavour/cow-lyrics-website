When You stand
I feel the floor of Heaven tremble
As You breathe
We live and have our being
When You speak
Oh, I feel it in my chest
When You sing
All my fears are put to rest
And what a wondrous thing
I can stand to sing
'Cause when I fall to my knees
You’re the one who pulls me up again
And what a mystery
That You notice me
And in a crowd of ten thousand
You don’t miss a thing
Oh, You don’t miss a thing
When You sigh
The wind becomes a sonnet
When You laugh
The storm around me ceases
You whisper
And all my enemies are scattered
You surround me
With angels on assignment
