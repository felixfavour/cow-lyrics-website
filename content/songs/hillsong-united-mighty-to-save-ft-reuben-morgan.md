Every one needs compassion,
 a love that is never failing,
let mercy fall on me
Every one needs forgiveness,
the kindness of the saviour,
the whole world miss you.
Saviour,  He can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save, He is mighty to save
Forever, author of salvation
He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus  conquered the grave.
So take me as you find me,
and all my fears are failures
fill my life again.
I give my life to follow,
everything I believe
and now I surrender all
Saviour he can move the mountains,
My God is mighty to save,  He is mighty to save
Forever,  author of salvation
He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave.
Shine your light,  let the whole world see
     (we are singing)
For the glory of the missing king
( Jesus)
shine your light and let the whole world see
we're singing, For the glory of the missing king
Saviour,  he can move the mountains,
My God  is mighty to save,  He is mighty to save
Forever,  author of salvation
He rose and conquered the grave,  Jesus conquered the grave
Saviour,  he can move the mountains
My God is mighty to save,  He is mighty to save
Forever,  author of salvation
He rose and conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave
Saviour,  he can move the mountains,
My God is mighty to save,  He is mighty to save
Forever, author of salvation
He rose and conquered the grave,
Jesus conquered the grave
Saviour,  He can move the mountains,
My God is mighty to save,  He is mighty to save
Forever,  author of salvation
He rose and  conquered the grave, Jesus conquered the grave
