[Intro: Brandon Lake]
Yeah-yeah
I've seen Your power
And I’ve seen You heal
I've lived stories that have proved Your faithfulness
And I've seen miracles my mind can’t comprehend
And there is beauty in what I can't understand
Jesus, it's You, Jesus, it's You
[Chorus: Brandon Lake]
I believe
You're the wonder-working God
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we’ll see
You’re too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Too good to not believe (ayy-ayy)
I can't resurrect a man with my own hands
But just the mention of Your name can raise the dead
So all the glory to the only One who can
Jesus, it’s You, Jesus, it's You
