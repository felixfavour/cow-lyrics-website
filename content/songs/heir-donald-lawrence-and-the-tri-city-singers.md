Oh, Don't you know, that you are called for greatness
Chosen to reign, to lead in Holy boldness
I’ve seen your failures and I know you need answers, but those with great failures, I've blessed to be great winners
See yourself in the future, you are royalty
Oh, Don't you know that you are called to greatness
Chosen to reign, to lead in Holy boldness
I’ve seen your failures and I know you need answers, but those
With great failures, I've blessed to be great winners
See yourself in the future, you are royalty
You are an heir, you are royalty
Destined to posses the land
You are and heir, embrace your legacy
See yourself, in the future, you are royalty
Oh, see your self in the future, you are royalty
You are an heir, you are royalty
Destined to possess the land
You are an heir, embrace your legacy
See yourself, in the future
See yourself in the future
Just see yourself in the future
Oh, oh, oh, oh, just see yourself in the future
Oh, oh, oh, oh, just see yourself in the future
You are royalty, you are, you are, you are
Oh, my sons and my daughters, don't you know that you are royalty
