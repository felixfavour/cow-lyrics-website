[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so unworthy
I don't deserve you
Grace and mercy
I'm so unworthy
I'm so unworthy
You left your throne because your love heard me
I'm so unworthy
In my sins I was lost
'Til the lighthouse of the cross
Saved a wretch like me
And now I am redeemed

I will spend forever falling in love with you
I will spend forever falling in love with you
(I finally got the courage to ask ya)
How could you love me?
When I fail you, still think of me
How could you love me?
(Why would you choose to do what you do Jesus?)
How could you love me?
(I was spiritually broke)
But the debt I owed (But you paid it)
You paid it for me (How?)
How could you love me?
(You don't keep a record of my wrongs, but Jesus, I do)
I messed up so many times (That I thought)
I thought love was just a lie (But then)
'Til it hung on Calvary (Every nail)
Every nail was just for me

I will spend forever (Forever) falling in love with you
(My appreciation is that long, Jesus)
I will spend forever (Forever) falling in love with you
(Catch me)
Take my hand and lead me through
(This world is crazy)
I'm lost and confused, please come (Please) to my (My) rescue
(King of kings)
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so unworthy (And the truth is)
I don't deserve you (Grace and mercy)
Grace and mercy (Because)
I'm so unworthy (Hallelujah)
(Over and over and over again
How you erase every sin, Jesus)
I'm so unworthy
(You became flesh like me)
You left your throne because your love heard me
I'm so unworthy
(I was sinking, sinking deep in sin
Far from the peaceful shore
But yet at the last minute)
In my sins (Yes) I was lost ('Til the lighthouse)
'Til the lighthouse of the cross (All the way from Calvary you)
Saved a wretch like me (And now by your blood)
And now I am redeemed (That's why)

I will spend forever (Forever) falling in love with you (I will)
I will spend forever (Forever) falling in love with you
[Bridge]
When time is erased and we meet face to face
I'll be falling in love with you ('Til I sit at your feet)
'Til I sit at your feet and my healing's complete (I will be)
I'll be falling in love with you ('Til every fear is gone)
'Til fear is all gone and you welcome me home
I'll be falling in love with you (And when you crack the sky)
Until I see the sun and you tell me, "Well done" (Woo!)
I'll be falling in love with you (Come on)
(And I will)
I'll be falling in love with you
[Outro]
I'm a mess, I make mistakes
Get mad and say things I shouldn't say
Still your love reminds me every day
I'm the reason why God made grace
I'm singing grace
I'm the reason why God made grace
I'm singing grace, yeah
I'm the reason why God made grace
See your grace is amazing
I was lost then you saved me
I was blind but now I see
I see the son who ran away
Who rejected every word I would say
But when the father sees the prodigal's face
He will hold him and will give him amazing grace, ayy
I'm singing grace
I'm the reason why God made grace (Hallelujah)
I'm singing grace
I'm the reason why God made grace
