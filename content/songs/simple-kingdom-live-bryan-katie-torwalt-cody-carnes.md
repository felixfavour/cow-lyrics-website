Your Kingdom is simple, as simple as love
You welcome the children, You stop for the one
We wanna see people the way Jesus does
Your Kingdom is simple; Lord, teach it to us
Your Kingdom is humble, as humble as death
This King is a Savior who gave His last breath
So we may die daily, our pride laid to rest
His Kingdom is humble, and the broken are blessed
[Chorus: Katie Torwalt & Cody Carnes, 
Katie Torwalt
]
Hallelujah
, hallowed be the name
May we live and breathe Your praise
And hallelujah, let all creation sing
Oh, the King of Heaven reigns
[Post-Chorus: Cody Carnes]
Yeah, yes, He does
Yes, He does
Your Kingdom is coming, Your Kingdom is here
Alive in our waiting, our work and our tears
So come to us quickly, forever our prayer
Your Kingdom is coming; Lord Jesus, come near
