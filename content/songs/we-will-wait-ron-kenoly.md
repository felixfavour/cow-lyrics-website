We will run and not grow weary
We will walk and will not faint
For the Lord will go before us
And His joy will be our strength
Mounting up with wings as eagles
As our spirits start to soar
When we come into His presence
And we wait upon the Lord
We will wait upon the Lord
For in His Presence
Is fullness of joy
And our strength
Will be restored
As we wait … upon the Lord
(Repeat verse & chorus)
(Repeat verse)
(Repeat chorus)
As we wait upon the Lord
For in His Presence
Is fullness of joy
And our strength
Will be restored
As we wait … upon the Lord
