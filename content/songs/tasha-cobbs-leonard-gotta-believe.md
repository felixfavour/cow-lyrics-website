I just gonna bel-ieve
there's goodness around the corner
and something better is in stock for me
someday I will see
there's a reason for all these tears
and there's an answer to all these prayers
I just gonna believe
 chorus:
it's gonna work out
like I knew it would
I will finish stronger than
I thought I could
there's a rainbow behind the clouds
the sun is bursting out
this could be the end
I know there's so much more
and I will find an open door
if I only believe
that this is just one page in my story
and if I keep breathing
and if I keep breathing
it's gonna work out
like I knew it would
I will finish stronger than
I thought I could
there's a rainbow behind the clouds
the sun is bursting out
it's gonna work out
like I knew it would
I will finish stronger than
I thought I could
there's a rainbow behind the clouds
the sun is bursting out
just believe
you gotta believe
just believe
you gotta believe
