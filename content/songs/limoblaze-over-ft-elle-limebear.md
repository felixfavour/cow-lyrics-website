Walls are falling down right before me
I've prayed for this moment
And now I receive it
I put my confidence in Who goes before me
You said it is finished, I'm fighting from victory
Oh my Abba, oh my loving Father
E no get thing way go fit sup to make me doubt Ya
Your name is a strong tower, my God
I never have to watch my back
I know you take care of that
'Cause even in my darkest hours
I know my God has got a light to pour
And I don't fear no more
Together we could dey through any tide
Na Your love way don take me to many heights
Oh my daddy, I just wanna make you happy
I just wanna be your Paddi
You already won the victory when I look around
Walls are falling down right before me
I've prayed for this moment
And now I receive it
I put my confidence in Who goes before me
He said it is finished, I'm fighting from victory
So it is over, over, over, over, over
He said it is finished, I'm fighting from victory
So it is over, over, over, over, over
He said it is finished, I'm fighting from victory
My challenger knows that it is over once I call You
At the mention of Your name, the Host of heaven comes through
Like David way don kill Goliath
I exceeded expectations
No running oh
'Cause even in my darkest hours
I know my God has got a light to pour
And I don't fear no more
Together we could dey through any tide
Na Your love way don take me to many heights
Oh my daddy, I just wanna make you happy
I just wanna be your Paddi
You already won the victory when I look around
Walls are falling down right before me
I've prayed for this moment
And now I receive it
I put my confidence in Who goes before me
He said it is finished, I'm fighting from victory
So it is over, over, over, over, over
He said it is finished, I'm fighting from victory
So it is over, over, over, over, over
He said it is finished, I'm fighting from victory

Victory, victory
