You are rising up
Your heart burns in us
Let justice fall, let justice fall
Setting captives free
Calling us to be
Your hands and feet
Chorus:
We unite for your kingdom's cause
So that hope will fall
Over all...
We unite for your kingdom's sake
So that love will reign
Above all...you reign above all
You're the God of hope
Calling us to go
And be your love
We need your love
Justice for the weak
For the least of these
Break our hearts
