I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus
No Turning Back, No Turning Back
No, No, No, No, No, No, No
No Turning Back
No, No, No, No, No, No, No
No Turning Back

Mi o ni choice
I go narrow, them think say I no know road o
Emimimo, na Him dey move me, dey lead me dey go o
On God, mind is made up o
Of course, no going back o
Non-stop, on 240
esu gan, o damiduro ti
Steady revving, mo’n te turtle, got eyes on the price o
Baba nla enikan ko le snatch me from His hand o
Ife Jesu lo wa mi ri, to gba’ku mi ku o
That’s why I follow

[Chant]
No, No, No, No, No, No, No
No Turning Back
No, No, No, No, No, No, No
No Turning Back

I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus
No Turning Back, No Turning Back
No, No, No, No, No, No, No
No Turning Back
No, No, No, No, No, No, No
No Turning Back

 I can never turn back o…
It’s already too late o…
It won’t make sense o…
Where am I going to?…
It’s already too late o…
I’ve already come too far.

We will burn the world
We will spend in billions
We will spend for Jesus
We will shift the culture
We will heal the sick
We will raise the dead
Transform the nation
Till we hear well done

I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus
No Turning Back, No Turning Back
No, No, No, No, No, No, No
No Turning Back
No, No, No, No, No, No, No
No Turning Back

[Chant]
No, No, No, No, No, No, No
No Turning Back
No, No, No, No, No, No, No
No Turning Back

I will never, never
Never, never
Never turn back

I will never, never
I will never, never
I will never, never
Never turn back

We will burn the world
We will spend in billions
We will spend for Jesus
We will shift the culture
We will heal the sick
We will raise the dead
Transform the nation
Till we hear well done
