I won't be ashamed to declare the praises
Of my God, the risen King
The One who gave His life for me
Name above all names
Who came to break the chains
The God who sets the captives free
His love will always fight for me
His love will always fight for me
We are not ashamed
To declare Your glory
And Your majesty
You're the only risen King
When I call Your name
All the earth will tremble
And thе darkness must flee
You're the only risеn King
I won't be ashamed to declare the praises
Of my God, the risen King
The One who gave His life for me
Name above all names
Who came to break the chains
The God who sets the captives free
His love will always fight for me
His love will always fight for me
