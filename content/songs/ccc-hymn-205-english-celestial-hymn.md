1. GOD the King of heavenly light, 
Everlasting King, 
Owner of eternal glory, 
Before whose presence, 
However little the sin,
Cannot come near thee 
Who with love calleth all sinners, 
To see the glory.

2. Those He loveth He calleth,
Those He calls He chooseth,
Those He choose He glorifies,
In this our dark world
And the world rejects His call
Going deeper in darkness,
Refusing calls to repentance,
Under destruction.

3. Ye expelled from garden of Eden
Think and repent now 
Come into the mansion of love
Where Jesus indeed reigneth
Before the throne of Father
Let sinners come to repentance
Reject not the call. 
Amen
