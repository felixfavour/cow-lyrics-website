Yes God yes God

We give you praise Lord, we give you praise
We give you praise Lord, we give you praise
We give you praise Lord, we give you praise
We give you praise Lord, we give you praise
Come on lift up your hands for Jesus say
We give you praise Lord, we give you praise
We give you praise Lord
We give you praise Lord, we give you praise
For all you’ve done Lord
For all you've done Lord, we give you praise
Lord when we think about it for all these times
For all you've done Lord, we give you praise
For all you’ve done
For all you've done Lord, we give you praise
So collectively we lift up our voice and give thanks
