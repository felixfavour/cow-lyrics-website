As the deer that pants for the water brook
So my heart does long for You
As the eagle flies for the open skies
So my heart does soar for You
I will praise Your name forever
I will proclaim that You are God
I will be satisfied completely
'Cause I will worship You alone
You alone, You alone
As the desert sand longs for rain again
So my hearts does longs for You
As the darkest night yields to morning light
So my heart does yield to You
I will praise Your name forever
I will proclaim that You are God
I will be satisfied completely
'Cause I will worship You alone
You alone, You alone
