I desire Jesus
Precious Lamb who ransomed me
Upon the cross He took my sin
And by His blood has set me free
I desire Jesus
Oh His Name my soul esteem
For upon His thorn-scarred brow
Is the crown of victory
He is worthy of all honor
All glory to His Name
He alone deserves our highest praise
And forever He will reign
I desire Jesus
Triumphant One the earth awaits
For on that day the earth will shine
With the glory of Your Name
You are worthy of all honor
All glory to Your Name
You alone deserve our highest praise
And forever You will reign
