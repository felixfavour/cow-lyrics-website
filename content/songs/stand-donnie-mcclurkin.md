What do you do
When you've done all you can
And it seems like it's never enough?
And what do you say
When your friends turn away
And you're all alone?
Tell me, what do you give
When you've given your all
And it seems like
You can't make it through?
[Hook 1]
Well you just stand
When there's nothing left to do
You just stand
Watch the lord see you through
Yes after you done all you can
You just stand
Tell me
How do you handle the guilt of your past?
Tell me, how do you deal with the shame?
And how can you smile
While your heart has been broken
And filled with pain?
Tell me what do you give
When you've given your all
Seems like you can't make it through?
