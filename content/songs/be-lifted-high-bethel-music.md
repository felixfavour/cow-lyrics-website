Be lifted high
Be lifted high
For Your glory, be lifted high
Be lifted high
Be lifted high
For Your glory, be lifted high
Be lifted high
Be lifted high
For Your glory, be lifted high
Be lifted high
Be lifted high
For Your glory, be lifted high
[Interlude]
You’re the King of all the ages
You’re the author of salvation
You’re the reason why we’re singing for Your glory
Lord, release the sound of Heaven
Let it rise in every nation
We will join the anthem singing (for Your glory)
Be lifted high
Be lifted high
For Your glory, be lifted high
Be lifted high
Be lifted high
For Your glory, be lifted high
