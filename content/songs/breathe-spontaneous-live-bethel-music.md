[Intro]
You are here right now
You are here right now
I can see Your smiling face
The pride in Your eyes
For Your children
I breathe You in
And I breathe You out
I breathe You in
Right here and now
'Cause worship is connection
Worship is connection
We're not just singing to the sky
Worship is connection
Oh, we're singing to the One who's been singing over us the whole time
Worship is connection
Oh, worship is connection
Oh, we're not just singing to the sky
We're returning a love song
To the One who's been singing over us all along
