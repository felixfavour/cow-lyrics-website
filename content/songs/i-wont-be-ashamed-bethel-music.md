[Chorus]
Oh, I won't be ashamed any longer
With You by my side, I stand taller
My sin was erased, now my life proclaims
I am free, I am free
Oh, I won't be ashamed any longer
With You by my side, I stand taller
My sin was erased, now my life proclaims
I am free, I am free!
[Turn]
Surprised by Your grace
My guilt erased
Wash in Your love, brand new I've become
And my fears are gone
Out of the dark
And into Your light
No longer a slave, You broke off my chains
Now I'm alive
Oh, I won't be ashamed any longer
With You by my side, I stand taller
My sin was erased, now my life proclaims
I am free, I am free!
