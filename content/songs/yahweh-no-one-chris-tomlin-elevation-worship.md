[Intro]
Ayy-ay, ayy-ay
Ayy-ay, ayy-ay
Yahweh, Yahweh
Holy is Your name
I don't want to take it in vain
Yahweh, Yahweh
Holy is Your name
I don’t want to take it in vain
There will be no other God before You
There will be no other God before You
There is no one above You, no one beside You
And nobody like You
There will be no other God before You
No one, no one, no one
No one, no one, no one
Yahweh, Yahweh
Holy is Your namе, I don't want to take it in vain, oh
Yahweh, Yahweh
Holy is Your namе, I don't want to take it in vain
