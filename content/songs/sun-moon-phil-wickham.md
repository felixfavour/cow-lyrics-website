If You are the Sun
Then I wanna be the moon
I wanna reflect the light that shines from You
And if this is war
Then I’m gonna draw my sword
This time, I know what I am fighting for
[Pre-Chorus]
God, I wanna let You know
I want everything You are
I’m waiting for the morning light
To show a fire in the dark
Shine Your light, I wanna feel You now
God, I need a miracle
Take my heart, make it glow
Shine Your light from the inside out
I wanna be more like You
If You are the Sun, then I wanna be the moon
And I wanna be the moon
If love is a choice
Then I need You to hear my voice
I’m the one knocking on Your door, making all this noise
Whatever it takes (Whatever it takes)
I give it all away
I wanna show my love in a thousand ways (Thousand ways)
