[Instrumental]
Our trust is in the One
Who holds it all together
Our hope is in the Name
That stands over all
Our future in the Hands
Of the God
Who will never be shaken
Never be shaken
God, You are in control
Your Truth will last forever
You're never letting go
You're fighting for all
Your confidence in us
Makes us brave
We will never be shaken
Never be shaken
[Pre-Chorus 1]
There is no limit to Your power
