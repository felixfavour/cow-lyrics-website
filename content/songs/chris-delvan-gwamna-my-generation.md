Intro
I will embrace your ways
and I will praise your name
and I will declare all of your praise
In the midst of my generation
I will embrace your ways
and I will praise your name
and I will declare all of your praise
In the midst of my generation
I will embrace your ways
and I will praise your name
and I must declare  your majesty
In the midst of my generation
for you are King over me
and your word is my life
I will declare all of your praise
in the midst of my generation
when I was lost
without a way of getting home
I saw in your word
the light of salvation
when the night and alone
you paid the price in the garden
to be become the light to all generations
Down in the valley
on every mountain top
I fear no evil
cause I follow in your step
wherever you lead
there I must go
as I lead my generation
I will embrace your ways
and I will praise your name
and I must declare all of your praise
In the midst of my generation
for you are King over me
and your word is my life
I will declare all of your praise
in the midst of my generation
for you are King over me
and your word is my life
I will declare all of your praise
in the midst of my generation
music
when I am down and I feel like running away
see from your life the perfect example
there lies my strength
when I see you go up that hill
to win the right to all generations
when I am lost
without a way of getting home
I see in your word
Your light of salvation
when in the night and alone
you paid the price in the garden
to become the light of all generations
for you are King over me
and your word is my life
I must declare all of your praise
in the the midst of my generation
for you are King over me
and your word is my life
I will declare all of your praise
in the the midst of my generation
for you are King over me
and your word is my life
I will declare all of your praise
in the midst of my generation
in the midst of my generation
in the midst of my generation
in the midst of my generation
in the midst of my generation
in the midst of my generation
in the midst of my generation
interlude
Jesus you win
when you broke the enemy
I have no excuse
but to follow in your league
as I bring down your light
and the power of your love
and your redemption to my generation
