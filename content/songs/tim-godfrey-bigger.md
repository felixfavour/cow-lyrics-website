Never seen this kind of God before
Awesome God you are in all your ways
Undisputed no one can contest
Your love it gives me comfort deep within
Demons flee they tremble at your name
Every knee must bow and tongue confess
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is your name
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is your name
You're greater (you're greater)
You're stronger (you're stronger)
You're higher than any other (you're higher than any other)
You're bigger than what people say
Bigger than what people say
You're bigger than what people say
Bigger than what people say
You're bigger than what people say
Bigger than what people say
You're bigger than what people say
Bigger than what people say
Who is greater than the Lord most high
I've searched and searched and yet we cannot find
Defender, protector, my rock, my shield and strength
Lover of my soul and peace within
Demons flee they tremble at your name
Every knee must bow and tongue confess
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is your name
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is your name
You're greater (you're greater)
You're stronger (you're stronger)
You're higher than any other (you're higher than any other)
You're bigger than what people say
Bigger than what people say
You're bigger than what people say
Bigger than what people say
You're bigger than what people say
Bigger than what people say
You're bigger than what people say
Bigger than what people say
You're bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger
Bigger than what people say
You're bigger and bigger so higher and higher
Bigger than what people say
You're bigger than what people say
Bigger than what people say
You're bigger than what people say
Bigger than what people say
You're greater (you're greater)
You're stronger (you're stronger)
You're higher (you're higher)
Bigger than what people say
You're greater (you're greater)
You're stronger (you're stronger)
You're higher (you're higher)
