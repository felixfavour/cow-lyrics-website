I can hear You
Calling my name
The ocean between us erased
And salvation pours down like rain
Flooding my walls till I break
Till I break
I give my life to You
My heart to You
Your all I need
Come and make me new
I give my life to you
My heart to You
Your all I need
So come and make me new
And I abandon
The weight of my sin
The weight of my loss and my pain
And relief swells
Like air in my lungs
And freedom releases my shame
My shame
I give my life to You
My heart to You
Your all I need
So come and make me new
