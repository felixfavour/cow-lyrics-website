The gospel of Jesus
It's the hope of the ages
Burning brighter and brighter
And standing forever
The church He is building
Nothing can stop it
It's a city that's shining
A light in the darkness
Nothing can stop it
[Chorus: Cody Carnes]
Though Christ was dead
Now surely He's risen
Yeah, He's coming back again
And Christ will reign in triumph forever
Yeah, all praise belongs to Him
Yeah, all praise belongs to Jesus
His Word is the answer
For all generations
It will never be tainted
It will never be brokеn
This is our confession
This is our conviction
We beliеve what is written
We believe what You've spoken
