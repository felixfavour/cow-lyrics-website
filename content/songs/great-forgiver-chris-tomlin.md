You are the great, great forgiver
There is no story You can't change
No broken heart that You can't save
I needed someone who
Could do what I could not do myself
Wash my sin away
'Cause You are the great, great forgiver
Nobody else gonna take my trouble
Nobody else gonna take my shame
'Cause You are the great, great forgiver
Nobody else gonna take my trouble
Nobody else gonna take my shamе
I need You, I need You, I need You, I need You, I need You
You are the great, grеat forgiver
You say I never have to hide
Your love for me is ocean wide
For all the things that You've done
All the battles that You've won for me
I'm thankful all the time
'Cause You are the great, great forgiver
Nobody else gonna take my trouble
Nobody else gonna take my shame
'Cause You are the great, great forgiver
Nobody else gonna take my trouble
Nobody else gonna take my shame
I need You, I need You, I need You, I need You, I need You
You are the great, great forgiver
