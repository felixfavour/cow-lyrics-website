The fullness of divinity became flesh
Love of God, Fatherâ€™s Son made manifest
The fullness of divinity became flesh

Lord Jesus, You are the living Word
Lord Jesus, You are the living Word

Lord, Saviour divine
My heart beats with Your life
Your Spirit lives in me
You paid for sin when You died
Conquered the grave when You rose
You are the living God

Lord, Saviour divine
My heart beats with Your life
Your Spirit lives in me
You paid for sin when You died
Conquered the grave when You rose
You are the living God

Death and hell
Are swallowed up in victory
Glory to Your Holy name
Now we stand proclaiming Your Authority
You are the living Word

Lord, Saviour divine
My heart beats with Your life
Your Spirit lives in me
You paid for sin when You died
Conquered the grave when You rose
You are the living God
