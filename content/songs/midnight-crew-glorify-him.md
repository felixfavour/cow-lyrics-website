ank you Jesus
We came to magnify the Lord
We came to lift him a little bit higher
The bible says give God all the glory and the lifter up of our head
I want a blessing here tonight
I want to give him all the glory that is due to his name
I feel God here
I feel him, Jesus we glorify you lord
We glorify your name Jesus
Ohhhhhh thank you Jesus
Halleluyah, glory unto your name oh Lord
Glorify him
We glorify him
Glorify him, we bring our heart and all
In humble sacrifice
As we glorify him
