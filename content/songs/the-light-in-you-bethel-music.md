There's something deep inside of your eyes
All the drama, all the pain
You've been walking through the midnight
And you lost your way
You've been looking for a true friend
Someone who understands
When you need someone to listen
Here I am, oh, here I am
I can see the light in you
I can see the light in you, yeah
Even if it's dark to you
Oh, I can see the light in you
The light in you
It's okay to feel your feelings
You don't have to hurry through
And it's okay, it's okay to cry, you're healing
'Cause when you cry, I cry too
I can see the light in you, yeah
I can see the light in you, oh
Even if it's dark to you, oh
Oh, I can see the light in you
The light
