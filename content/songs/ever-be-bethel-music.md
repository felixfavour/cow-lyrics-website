(Heeeey, yeeeah, heey, yeeah)
Your love is devoted
Like a ring of solid gold
Like a vow that is tested
Like a  covenant of old
And Your love is enduring
Through the winter rain
And beyond the horizon
With mercy for today
[Pre-Chorus]
Faithful You have been
And faithful You will be
You pledge yourself to me
And itâ€™s why I sing
Your praise will ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
Your  praise will ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
Your praise will ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
Your  praise will ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
(Heeeey, yeeeah, heey, yeeah)
