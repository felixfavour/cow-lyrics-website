You are the medicine
The only cure for everything I feel within
Redeeming what was lost and all that could have been
Oh this is a healing kind of love
You are the Truest Friend
Staying through the night when I was at my end
Comforting my heart till it was light again
Oh this is a faithful kind of love
Everlasting Father
Prince of Peace
Immanuel, God with us
You're here with me
Wonderful Counselor
The government is resting on Your shoulders
You are the Final Word
You alone decide when every page will turn
So I will trust Your timing, I will rest secure
Oh this is a steady kind of love
Everlasting Father
Prince of Peace
Immanuel, God with us
You're here with me
Wonderful Counselor
The government is resting on Your shoulders
Your Names say it all
They say it all
I stand in awe of You
Everlasting Father
Prince of Peace
Immanuel, God with us
You're here with me
Wonderful Counselor
The government is resting on Your shoulders
