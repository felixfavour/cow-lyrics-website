you have been so strong, you cannot be wrong coz in the past you have overcome
On your face there's a light that shows you are a winner
You are a gem in this life, your glory will soon unfold
you cannot afford to fail in the face of any trial
it is time to stand and overcome again
Don't give up, it's not over
