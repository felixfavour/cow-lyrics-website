Intro:
1 Who spoke creation and knit it together?
His mercy endureth forever
Who hung the stars in all of their splendor?
His mercy endureth forever
2 Who formed the earth and set it in motion?
His mercy endureth forever
Who built the mountains and filled up the ocean?
His mercy endureth forever
Pre Chorus:
There is    none like You
Chorus:
He’s The King     of  Glory
He’s The One       and   Only
So we say       'Amen' to The Great   I      Am
He’s The King     of   glory
All hail!
