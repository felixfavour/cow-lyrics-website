Hallelujah
In the valley you will comfort me
You'll forever be my sovereignty
surely grace  and mercy fall on me
They will fall on me(they will fall on me)
They will fall on me ( they will fall on me)
In the valley you will comfort me
You'll forever be my sovereignty
Surely grace and mercies fall on me
They will fall on me (they will fall on me)
They will fall on me (they will fall on me)
You haven't failed me yet oh ohh
 you haven failed me yet
You haven failed me yet ohh ohh
You haven 't failed me yet
You haven 't failed me yet ohh oh
You haven 't failed me yet
You haven't failed me yet ohh oh
You haven 't failed me yet
