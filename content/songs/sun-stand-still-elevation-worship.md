We confess our dreams are way too small
God for who You are
You're beyond expectations
We're crying out for restoration here
You are the God who saves
You're beyond limitations
Chorus:
Sun stand still
Oceans part
Nothing is too hard
Nothing is too hard
Refuge for the weak
Strong and mighty
Nothing is too hard
Nothing is too hard
Within us, the spirit who raised Christ
Victor over death
You're the God of resurrection
More than we could ask or imagine
This promise is ours
The hope of our salvation
Chorus
