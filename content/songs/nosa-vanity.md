used to say she was the apple of his eyes
but not again, not again
she used to be the main attraction to all the guys
but now shes 38, nobody even looks her way
vanity on vanity just left to the wind and nothing else
nothing in this world is real they all fade away like vapor like ice they melt
but the man who does Gods will will spend all his years fulfilled like a tree
that is planted by the stream wit his leaves forever green
i got the house the cars the fame see am a star
the girls the cash just wouldn't last
and everything a man can ask
but in the midst of all these things i feel so *
and all the parties and all the friends can fell the void i feel within
vanity on vanity just left to the wind and nothing else
nothing in this world is real they all fade away like vapor like ice they melt
but the man who does Gods will will spend all his years fulfilled like a tree
that is planted by the stream wit his leaves forever green
vanity on vanity just left to the wind and nothing else
nothing in this world is real they all fade away like vapor like ice they melt
but the man who does Gods will will spend all his years fulfilled like a tree
that is planted by the stream wit his leaves forever green
he used to say what he would do when he turn 30
but he didnt plan to live t long
he put his hands in many wrongs
now hes been shot
just when his life was about to start
but he saw the word he *
what he gave is what he got
vanity on vanity just left to the wind and nothing else
nothing in this world is real they all fade away like vapor like ice they melt
but the man who does Gods will will spend all his years fulfilled like a tree
that is planted by the stream wit his leaves forever green
vanity on vanity just left to the wind and nothing else
nothing in this world is real they all fade away like vapor like ice they melt
vanity on vanity just left to the wind and nothing else
nothing in this world is real they all fade away like vapor like ice they melt
