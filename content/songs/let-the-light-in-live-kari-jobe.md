It's time for the sleeper to wake
It's time for the old winds to change
I hear the Spirit say it's time
It's time for the dead man to rise
It's time for the Great Light to shine
I hear the Spirit say it's time
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Let the King of glory in
Let the King of glory in
Come ride in on Your people's praise
Let the King of glory in
Let the King of glory in
It's time for the sleeper to wake
It's timе for the old winds to change
I hear thе Spirit say it's time
It's time for the dead man to rise
It's time for the Great Light to shine
I hear the Spirit say it's time
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Let the King of glory in
Let the King of glory in
Come ride in on Your people's praise
Let the King of glory in
Let the King of glory in
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Let the King of glory in
Let the King of glory in
Come ride in on Your people's praise
Let the King of glory in
Let the King of glory in
[Bridge]

Open up the windows, let the light in
Open up the windows, let the light in (
Awake those sleepers
)
Open up the windows, let the light in (
Rise from the dead
)
Let the light in, let the light in
Open up the windows, let the light in (
The Christ will shine on you
)
Open up the windows, let the light in (
The Christ will shine on you
)
Open up the windows, let the light in
Let the light in, let the light in
Open up the windows, let the light in
Open up the windows, let the light in
Open up the windows, let the light in
Let the light in, let the light in
Open up the windows, let the light in
Open up the windows, let the light in
Open up the windows, let the light in
Let the light in, let the light in
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Let the King of glory in
Let the King of glory in
Come ride in on Your people's praise
Let the King of glory in
Let the King of glory in
