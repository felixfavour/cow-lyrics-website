O the blood of The Passover Lamb
Is applied to the door of my life
No power of darkness could ever withstand
The force of the blood sacrifice
Though Satan will bring accusations
I let him know right where I stand
For now there is no condemnation
I'm under the blood of the Lamb
I’m under the blood of the Lamb
That covers the guilt of my past
By the mercy of God
Holy and righteous I stand
I'm under the blood of the Lamb
I'm safe and secure from the enemy’s plan
No weapon formed against me will stand
I'm under the blood of the Lamb
O the blood of The Passover Lamb
Is applied to the door of my life
No power of darkness could ever withstand
The force of the blood sacrifice
Though Satan will bring accusations
I let him know right where I stand
For now there is no condemnation
I'm under the blood of the Lamb
