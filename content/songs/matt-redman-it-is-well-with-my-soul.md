Is Well With My Soul (Live) - Matt Redman
Our scars are a sign
Of grace in our lives
Oh Father how You brought us through
When deep were the wounds
And dark was the night
The promise of Your love You proved
Now every battle still to come
Let this be our song
It is well
It is well
With my soul
With my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
Weeping may come
Remain for a night
But joy will paint the morning sky
You're there in the fast
You're there in the feast
Your faithfulness will always shine
Now every blessing still to come
Let this be our song
It is well
It is well
With my soul
With my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
I trust Your ways
I trust Your ways
I trust Your name
I trust Your name
It is well it is well with my soul
You lead us through battles
You lead us through battles
You lead us to blessing
You lead us to blessing
And You make us fruitful
And You make us fruitful
In the land of our suffering God
It is well it is well with my soul
It is well
It is well
With my soul
With my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
I trust Your ways
I trust Your ways
I trust Your name
I trust Your name
It is well it is well with my soul
It is well it is well with my soul my soul
It is well it is well with my soul with my soul
It is well it is well with my soul
I trust Your ways
I trust Your ways
I trust Your name
I trust Your name
It is well it is well with my soul
