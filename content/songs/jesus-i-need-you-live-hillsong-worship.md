Hope be my anthem
Lord when the world has fallen quiet
You stand beside me
Give me a song in the night
Jesus I need You
Every moment I need You
Hear now this grace bought heart sing out
Your praise forever
Beauty for ashes
You find the weak and contrite heart
Shoulder its burdens
And carry it into the light
Jesus
Jesus I need You
Every moment I need You
Hear now this grace bought heart sing out
Your praise forever
And Jesus I need You
Every moment I need You
Hear now this grace bought heart sing out
Your praise forever
