Heaven thundered, and the world was born
Life begins and ends, in the dust You formed
Faith commanded, and the mountains moved
Fear is losing ground, to our hope in You
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go on and on
Impossible things
In Your name, they shall be done
Freedom conquered, all our chains undone
Sin defeated, Jesus has overcome
Mercy triumphed when the third day dawned
Darkness was denied, when the stone was gone
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go on and on
Impossible things
In Your name, they shall be done
Unstoppable God
Let Your glory go on and on
Impossible things
In Your name, they shall be done
