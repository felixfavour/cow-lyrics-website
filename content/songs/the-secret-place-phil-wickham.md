[Intro: Phil Wickham & Madison Cunningham, 
Phil Wickham
, 
Madison Cunningham
]
Better is a moment that I spend with You
Than a million other days away
I'm running
, 
I'm running
I'm
 running to the secret place
Where will you run, my soul?
Where will you go when wells run dry?
When the wind starts to blow
How you gonna keep this flame alive?
[Pre-Chorus: Phil Wickham & Madison Cunningham]
In the fading light, when night is breaking
I know You will always be waiting
You'll always be there
[Chorus: Phil Wickham & Madison Cunningham, 
Madison Cunningham
]
I'm running to the secret place
Where You are, where You are 
(Woah)
I'll sing for You of all the ways
'Cause You stole my heart, stole my heart 
(Woah)
Better is a moment that I spend with You
Than a million other days away
I'm running, I'm running
I'm running to the secret place
