It’s so amazing
You’re the God who made the heavens
Great is Your love for me
You load me with mercy in the morning
And goodness at night time
In and out of season
I’m basking in Your grace

So, on my lips Your Praise is on repeat
Like an anthem in my soul, Almighty God

I love You now and always my eternal King
Your liquid love is overwhelming
It’s indescribable

So, on my lips Your Praise is on repeat
Like an anthem in my soul, Almighty God

I love You now and always my eternal King
Your liquid love is overwhelming
It’s indescribable

You strike the sweetest love chords
On the strings of my heart
Your demonstrated love’s my victory

I love You now and always my eternal King

It’s so amazing
That the voice that formed creation
Is the same that calls my name at every dawn.

You lit up my life with the beauty of Your glory
For You alone, my Lord, I live

So, on my lips Your Praise is on repeat
Like an anthem in my soul, Almighty God

The thorns of my pain
You wore in a crown
You died and rose that I might live again

And all of my days
I’ll be telling Your story
There’s nothing else I live for but You, only You
