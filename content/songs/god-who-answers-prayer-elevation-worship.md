God who answers prayer
Sees me in my need
Runs to my despair
Your promise I believe
Pre-Chorus:
That You Are, You Are, You Are God
Chorus:
Bless the Lord with all that's within o my soul
I cry out with all that I am make me whole
Here I stand I place all my hope in you
My Healer will see me through
God who answers prayer
Faithful you will be
In my darkest hour
Your promise I believe
Bridge:
My Savior, my God on High
The One who has brought me life
I surrender all that I am
Into your hands, I'm in your hands
