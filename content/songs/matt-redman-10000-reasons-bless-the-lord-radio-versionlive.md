Chorus:
Bless the Lord oh my soul, Oh oh oh my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, Oh my soul
Worship Your holy name
Verse 1:
The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning
It's time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes.
Chorus:
Bless the Lord oh my soul, Oh oh oh my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, Oh my soul
Worship Your holy name
Verse 2:
You're rich in Love and You're slow to anger
Your name is great and Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find
Chorus:
(so) Bless the Lord oh my soul, Oh oh oh my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, Oh my soul
I Worship Your holy name
Verse 3:
And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forever more
(Forevermore)
Chorus:
Bless the Lord oh my soul, Oh oh oh my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, Oh my soul
I Worship Your holy name
Bless the Lord oh my soul, Oh oh oh my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, Oh my soul
I Worship Your holy name
(Yes I will)
Worship Your holy name
Lord I'll worship Your Holy name
