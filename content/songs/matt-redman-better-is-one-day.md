tle: Better Is One Day
Artist: Matt Redman
How lovely is Your dwelling place
O Lord Almighty
For my soul longs
And even faints for you
For here my heart is satisfied
Within Your presence
I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Thousands elsewhere
One thing I ask and I would seek
(I would seek)
To see Your beauty
To find you in the place Your glory dwells
(Oh Lord)
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
My heart and flesh cry out
For you, the living God
Your spirit's water to my soul
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to you
I will draw near to you
To yyyoouuuu!
Better is one day
Better is one day
Better is one day
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day
Better is one day
Better is one day
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day
Better is one day
Better is one day
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
