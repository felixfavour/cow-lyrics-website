You hide, I want to find You
Go, and I will follow You
I want to be where You are
As You move, I'm right beside You, love
I'm running after You
I want to be where You are
I'm chasing You, I'm so in love
Captivated, I just can't get enough
I'll spend my days, running after Your heart
Your heart, Your heart, woah-oh, oh, oh
I'm chasing You, with all my love
Captivated, I just can't get enough
I'll spend my days, running after Your heart
Your heart, Your heart, woah-oh, oh, oh, oh
Heart
You've won me heart and soul
And where You lead I'll go
I want to be where You are
From the moment I rise, to the moment I sleep
My affection is for You, and even as I dream
I want to know You, I'm after Your heart
