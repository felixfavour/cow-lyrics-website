In the silence, in the still
In the mystery revealed
You're the anchor I will cling to
Holy Spirit lead me on
You're the peace that overcomes
Take heart, have courage
[Chorus: Brian Johnson]
I lift my eyes up to the Heavens
I know Your love will break through
I fix my eyes on the horizon
I know Your love will break through
You're the whisper on the wind
A true and constant friend
Full of hope and quiet confidence
You're the voice that never sleeps
Always singing over me
Take heart, have courage
Take heart, have courage
[Chorus: Brian Johnson & Amanda Cook]
I lift my eyes up to the Heavens
I know Your love will break through
I fix my eyes on the horizon
I know Your love will break through
