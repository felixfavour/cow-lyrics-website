You meet me on the mountain top
You see in me in the valley low
There is no home without You here
And I find You in the crowded thoughts
You quiet all the question marks
There is no space Your love won't fill
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll trade all my fear for peace of mind
All my heaviness for burdens light
And this will be my song
That You are always good
I'll sing it all day long
That You are always good
And when the day is through
I am left with You are always
You are always good
And I'll set my eyes on perfect faith
You'll finish what You start in me
And my heart will be an offering
