I had a dream that I was speaking
With a prophet from the land of wise
In a crowd of people from the land of troubled hearts
I said, "We've come here for answers
A solution to our world's demise"He said the journey would be long
But here is where you start
Love one another
Love one another
Work it in to work it out
There can never be enough
Love one another
Love one another
'Cause you know without a doubt
You can change your world with love
It was a simple conclusion
But I thought that it was rather profound
Just a fundemental law that we should all live by
I took it in to tomorrow
Yeah, I walked the earth but I never found
Any corner of the world
Where this did not apply
Love one another
Love one another
Work it in to work it out
There can never be enough
Love one another
Love one another
'Cause you know without a doubt
You can change your world with love
