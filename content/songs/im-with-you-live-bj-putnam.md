You are not alone, I'm with you
Everywhere you go I'm there
You don't have to be afraid
I have always been the same
You are not alone, I'm with you
Every whisper I can hear
As close as breathing out my name
I'm aware of everything
You are not alone, I'm with you
Oh our God is here, oh our God is here
He is with us now, He is with us now
There is no more fear, there is no more fear
He is with us, He is with us
You are not alone, He's with you
Everywhere you go He's there
You don't have to be afraid
He has always been the same
You are not alone, He's with you
