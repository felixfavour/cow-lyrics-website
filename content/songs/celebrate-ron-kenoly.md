This is the time for the people of God to celebrate, celebrate (repeat)
This is the day, the hour, the moment
The minute for the people of God
Get up, get into it, celebrate
This is the hour, the moment, the minute
To celebrate
This is the day for the people of God
To celebrate, celebrate (2x)
Thank him for His love
We praise Him for his power
We thank Him for his grace
Every minute every hour
Celebrate
This is the hour the moment the minute
To celebrate
Enter His gates with thanksgiving
Enter His courts with joy
This is the hour the moment the minute
The second to lift up our voices
In honor and reverence
So stand up and praise Him
And give Him the glory
Heâ€™s worthy to have it so let's let Him know it
