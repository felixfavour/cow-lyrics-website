Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh

Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh
Yahweh, Yahweh
Nothing else matters (nothing else matters)
Nothing else counts (nothing else counts)
When I'm in the presencе (I'm in the presencе)
Of my maker (of my maker)
Anything can happen now (anything can happen)
I say everything is possible (everything's possible)
For I'm in the presence (I'm in the presence)
Oh, of my maker, my maker (of my maker)
Nothing else matters (nothing else matters)
