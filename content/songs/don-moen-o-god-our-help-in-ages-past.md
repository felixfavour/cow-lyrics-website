Oh God our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come
Our shelter from the stormy blast
And our eternal home
Under the shadow of Thy throne
Still may we dwell secure
Sufficient is Thine arm alone
And our defense is sure
Before the hills in order stood
Or earth received her frame
From everlasting Thou art God
To endless years the same
Oh God our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come
Be Thou my guide while life shall last
And our eternal home
