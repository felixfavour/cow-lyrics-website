[Chorus]
How can you refuse Him now?
How can you refuse Him now?
How can you turn away from His side?
With tears in His eyes
On the cross there He died
How can you refuse Jesus now?
There’s a story old
That has often been told
Of how our Saviour died
As they nailed His hands
He cried "they don’t understand"As the blood flowed from His side
How can you refuse Him now?
How can you refuse Him now?
How can you turn away from His side?
With tears in His eyes
On the cross where He died
How can you refuse Jesus now?
As He hung there on the tree
He prayed for you and prayed for me
There was no one His pain to ease
Before He died He faintly cried
"Father forgive them please"
