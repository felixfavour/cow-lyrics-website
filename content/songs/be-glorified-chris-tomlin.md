[x2]
Your love has captured me
Your grace has set me free
Your life the air I breathe
Be glorified in me
You set my feet to dancing
You set my heart on fire
In the presence of a thousand kings
You are my one desire
I stand before you now
With trembling hands lifted high
Be glorified

[Bridge][x2]
Be glorified in me
Be glorified in me
Be glorified in me
Be glorified
