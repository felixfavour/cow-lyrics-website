I'm a picture of Your faithfulness
I'm a miracle in process
God, I never would have guessed
That You were working in the darkness
Oh-oh, oh-oh
This is my before and after
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's a new light in my eyes
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Some things the camera can't capture
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I was dead, now I'm alive
You taught my heart to beat again
When everything felt lifeless
You lifted me up from the depths
And You gave me back my purpose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh
This is my before and after
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's a new light in my eyes
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Some things the camera can't capture
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I was dead, now I'm alive
Oh-oh, oh-oh
This is my before and after
Oh-oh, oh-oh
There's a new light in my eyes
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Some things the camera can't capture
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I was dead, now I'm alive
Oh I'm alive, oh I'm alive, oh I'm alive
Oh I'm alive, oh I'm alive
Oh I'm alive, alive, alive, alive, alive
Oh I'm alive, oh I'm alive, oh I'm alive
