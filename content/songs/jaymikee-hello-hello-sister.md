It's Jaymikee on the beat
Hello hello sister
Don't know how to say this but I
Will do my best to say what is on my mind
I cannot deny it
There is something about you that I cannot
Take note and it makes me want to know more
It is more than the beauty in your smile
It is more than the sparkle in your eyes
Like a fire deep inside you
Reaching for my spirit man
Now the joy and peace I feel inside I
Can't explain it but it sounds like this
It is a melody
It is a melody in my heart
E se oluwa
You've brought a melody
You've brought a melody in my heart
O se oluwa
You've brought a melody
You've brought a melody in my heart
O se oluwa
It is a melody
Okay okay sister
You may not understand what you've done to
My own heart now that you're my dream come true
This is so exciting
For so long I've been praying and searching
For the will of God now you're finally here
You go above and beyond expectations
The love you have for God just blows my mind
You have shown me the true meaning of why it pays to wait on God
Now the joy and peace I feel inside I
Can't describe it but it sounds like this
E se Oluwa
You've brought a melody
You've brought a melody in my heart
E se Oluwa
It is a melody
It is a melody in my heart
E se Oluwa
You've brought a melody
You've brought a melody in my heart
E se Oluwa
She is a melody
She is a melody in my heart
From the bottom of my heart I say thank you Lord
For giving me a helper, a lover and a friend
She said yes to me cause I first said yes to you
And today I have no regrets
Because I give my all to you Jesus
You gave me something better better
So forever I am grateful Lord
