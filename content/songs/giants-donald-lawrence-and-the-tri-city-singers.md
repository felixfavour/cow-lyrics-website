Chorus
Giants
Do die
The bigger they are
They harder they fall
Giants
They die
Just walk around
The Jericho wall
VAmp
As We come in your name
And we stand on your word
What is loosed in the heavens
Will be lossed on Earth
As We come in your name
And we stand on your word
What is loosed in the heavens
Will be loosed on Earth
Let God arise Giants, DIE!
Chorus
Bridge
Your praise
Will bring down strong holds
When you praise
You will see miracles
Just praise
When things seem impossible
Then the King of Glory
Will show his Glory
Let God Arise giants, DIE!
