All my hands have made
I'm laying down.
All that I hold dear, my many crowns
I've tasted and seen of your great love
You satisfy me
You satisfy me
Spirit fall
Open up heaven's door,
We're waiting with worship for more,
You're the only one that satisfies me.
My constant request above all things.
Every hour I wake, yeah, ooooooh
Be near me, Oh God
Though I've tasted and seen of your great love
Show me your glory
Show me your glory.
Spirit fall,
Open up heaven's door
We're waiting with worship for more
You're the only one that satisfies me
Lord we run into your loving hands
We're safe and secure in your love
You're the only one that satisfies me
Leave me astounded
Leave me amazed
Show off your glory
Let heaven invade
We're waiting with worship
We're waiting with praise
For the Almighty presence of God to invade
Spirit fall
Open up heaven's door.
We're waiting with worship for more
You're the only one that satisfies me
Lord we run
Into your loving hands
We're safe and secure in your love
You're the only one that satisfies me
Leave me astounded
Leave me amazed
Show off your glory
Let heaven invade
We're waiting with worship
We're waiting with praise
For the Almighty presence of God to invade.
Leave me astounded
Leave me amazed
Show off your glory
Let heaven invade
We're waiting with worship
We're waiting with praise
For the Almighty presence of God to invade.
