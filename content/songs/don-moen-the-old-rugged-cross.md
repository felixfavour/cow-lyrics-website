On a hill far away,
Stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame:
And I love that old cross,
Where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross...
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross...
And exchange it some day for a crown.
In the old rugged cross,
Stain with blood, So divine...
Oh wondrous beauty I see.
For trust on that old cross
Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me.
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross...
And exchange it someday for a Crown.
Oh,  that old rugged cross, so despised by the world, Has a wondrous attraction for me: For7 the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,  To bear it dark Calvary.
In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine, A wondrous beauty I see: For twas on that old cross Jesus suffered  and died, To pardon and sanctify me.
To the old rugged cross I will ever be true, it's shame and reproach gladly bear: The He'll call me some day to my home far away, Where His glory forever I'll share.
