Why do you cry? He has risen
Why are you weeping? He's not dead
Why do you cry? He has risen
Why are you weeping? He's not dead
He paid it all on that lonely highway
And His anointing I can feel
He shed His blood for my transgressions
And by His stripes we are healed
Why do you cry? He has risen
Why are you weeping? He's not dead
So as you go through lifes journey
Don't you worry lift up your head
Don't you cry stop your weeping
He has risen He's not dead
Don't cry
Wipe your eyes
He's not dead
Oh don't weep
He's not asleep
Je-hovah
He's not dead
Oh don't cry
Wipe your eyes
He's not dead
