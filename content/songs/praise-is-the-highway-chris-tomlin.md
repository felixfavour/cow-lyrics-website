The rocks will cry out, the oceans will roar
The mountains will bow to the name of the Lord
He is our God, He will be praised
The idols will fall, the strongholds will break
Every weapon that forms will shatter and fail
He is our God, He is our faith
Praise is the highway to the throne of God
Praise is the highway to the heart of God
Praise is the highway to the move of God
Revival will come, the church will awake
His anthem will drown all other refrains
He is our song, He forever reigns
He reigns!
Praise is the highway to the throne of God
Praise is the highway to the heart of God
Praise is the highway to the move of God
(We want to see you move)
