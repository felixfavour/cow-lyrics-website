"It's Rainin'"[Chorus:]
Send it on down
Send it down
Send the rain down
[Repeat 3x]
[Lead (Choir):]
We need to feel some holy drops from you (send it on down)
Lord we are willing to go through and through (send it on down)
Shower down a blessing on your people (send it on down)
Lord we need you to shower down a blessing on us. (send it on down)
[Repeat lead ]
[Bridge:]
Were waiting here for a bessing
Let it fall down on me
We need to feel your anointing
Let it fall fresh on me
[Vamp:]
Its raining
Its raining
Its raining
