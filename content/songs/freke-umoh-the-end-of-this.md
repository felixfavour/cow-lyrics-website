sometimes the way up is down
unusual places where treasures are found I may not like where I'm at right now but I'm not where I used to be so I can tell you that
I will see the end of this
it won't see the end of me (yee)
oh I will see the end of this
it won't see the end...of me
victory's still in sight
yesterday's failures cannot stop the light of the new day to shine on... me
there is more reason within and around to believe that
I will see the end of this
oh it won't see the end of me
oh I will see...the end of this
and it won't see the end of me
we will see the end of this
it won't see the end of us
we will see the end of this
it won't see the end...
oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
oh  oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh oh
we are not a failure (oh oh oh)
yesterday is gone (oh oh oh oh)
the sun is rising over Nigeria (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
we are  not a failure
yesterday is gone
the sun is rising over Africa
we are not a failure
yesterday is gone
the sun is rising over Nigeria
we are not a failure
yesterday is gone
the sun is rising over Africa
