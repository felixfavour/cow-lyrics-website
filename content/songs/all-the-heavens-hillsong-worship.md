Holy, holy are You Lord
The whole earth is filled with Your glory
Let the nations rise to give
Honor and praise to Your name
[Pre-Chorus]
Let Your face shine on us
And the world will know You live
All the heavens shout Your praise
Beautiful is our God, the universe will sing
Hallelujah to You, our King
Holy, holy are You Lord
The whole earth is filled with Your glory
Let the nations rise to give
Honor and praise to Your name
[Pre-Chorus]
Let Your face shine on us
And the world will know You live
All the heavens shout Your praise
Beautiful is our God, the universe will sing
Hallelujah to You, our King
And all the heavens shout Your praise
Beautiful is our God, the universe will sing
Hallelujah to You, our King
