1: Halleluyah, Halleluyah,
Halleluyah, Halleluyah,
Believe Jesus within the broad light,
The world is heading towards its end,
The world is heading towards its end.
Chorus: Jesus Christ’s the Father of
this light,
Let’s kneel by His feet,
And expect joyfulness on the last day,
And expect joyfulness on the last day.

2: Hosanna’s song of the Angels,
Hosanna’s song of the Angels,
Let’s work spiritually in Celestial,
So we might be thanked and called a
good servant,
So we might be thanked and called a
good servant.
Chorus: Jesus Christ’s the Father of
this light,
Let’s kneel by His feet,
And expect joyfulness on the last day,
And expect joyfulness on the last day.
Amen
