As long as the sun blazes and burns
Your mercies will never fail
As long as the seed time and harvest endure
Your mercies will never fail
And when my soul is downcast within
Your compassions have no end
Though the arrows pierce me
Though the darkness rages fiercely
You will be my strength
Though the earth gives way
My portion You will ever be
In fear or in faith
I'll say to my soul
Your mercies will never fail
A promise for ages
An anchor that holds
Your mercies will never fail
And when my soul is downcast within
Your compassions have no end
Though the arrows pierce me
Though the darkness rages fiercely
You will be my strength
Though the earth gives way
My portion You will ever be
