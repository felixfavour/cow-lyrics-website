Persecuted
But not forsaken
Cast down
But not destroyed
I have something
This world can’t take
Away from me
(Repeat)
No matter how hard you try
You can’t take it
I may even have to cry but I’ll
I’ll make it
There’s
Joy for my sorrows
Hope for tomorrow
I have something
This world can’t take away
I’ve been persecuted
CHORUS (1x)
In the midst of my trials I will
Be alright
In the midst of my pain I know I will
I’ll survive
There’s joy for my sorrows
I have, hope for tomorrow
I have something
This world can’t take away
I’ve been persecuted YEAH
Persecuted
But not forsaken
Cast down
But not destroyed
I have something…
This world can’t take
I have something…
This world can’t take
I have something…
This world can’t take
AWAY FROM ME
Can’t take my joy away
Can’t take my joy away
Can’t take my joy away
Can’t take my joy away
I’m a survivor!
I’ll make it!
I’m a survivor!
I’ll make it!
I’ll make it!
I’ll make it!
I’ll make it!
I’ll make it!
I’ll make it!
Can’t take my joy away!
Can’t take my joy away! (4xs)
CAN’T TAKE MY JOY AWAY!
