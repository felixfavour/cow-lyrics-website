Here and now, I draw a boundary
Against every weapon that's formed
The thief and his plans will pass over
When he sees the red on the door
I plead the blood
I plead the blood of Jesus
The enemy can't take my family
'Cause this home belongs to the Lord
So I'm not afraid to remind him
That he has no claim in this war
I plead the blood
I plead the blood of Jesus
It’s more than enough
I plead the blood of Jesus
My future is glory to glory
My freedom's been purchased in full
For all of the wеight of His suffering
The Lamb will recеive His reward
