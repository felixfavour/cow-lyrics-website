[Intro ]
Come on let’s put those hands together one more time
We going to play something tonight
Let’s go
We need Your Spirit pouring out on us, Oh God
We need revival stirring up oh god
We just want you, we just want you
We just want you, we just want you
Hallelujah come on help us sing
Creation waits, Creation waits
We people long for You, We people long for You
Yes Lord
We Anticipate a Mighty Move
We’re leaning, We’re leaning
Trusting, trusting
Patiently, Patiently we are waiting, we waiting
We desperate we desperate and we are and we are
Crying out
