[Intro]
(Miracle today)
(And God has always made a way)
(If you're a miracle today)
(Sound post digital, digital, digital, digital)
(And God has always made a way)
(If you're a miracle today)
(People, the perfect people)
(And God has always made a way)
(People, the perfect people)
(If you're a miracle today)
(All the perfect people, the perfect people)
May you already know who it is, boy
It's pH-1
(Perfect people, the perfect people, people)
Let's get it
Okay now everyday
I wake up in the morning
Boy I'm just living this moment
뉴욕부터 Seoul
시차적응 안된 몸 일으키며
나일 탓했어 (What a night)
What a night man, what a night
I be chillin with Mr. Q
지금 난 별 다른말
하는게 아니고 약간의 flexing
