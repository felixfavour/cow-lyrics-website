[Chorus: Steffany Gretzinger]
All is for Your glory
All is for Your name
All is for Your glory
That in all things You would have the first place
And that in all things You would have preeminence, yeah
Yeah
There's one thing chief end to man’s purpose
And one main reason for existence
All man's vain and high ambitions
Will one day be brought low
Will one day be brought low
[Interlude: Steffany Gretzinger]
Yeah
Yeah
To treasure You
To treasure You above all others
To love You like we love no other
Your greatness soon will be uncovered
And all thе earth will then know
And all the еarth will then know
