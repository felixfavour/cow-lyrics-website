[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so unworthy
I don't deserve you
Grace and mercy
I'm so unworthy
I'm so unworthy
You left your throne because your love heard me
I'm so unworthy
In my sins I was lost
'Til the lighthouse of the cross
Saved a wretch like me
And now I am redeemed
I will spend forever falling in love with you
I will spend forever falling in love with you
(I finally got the courage to ask ya)
How could you love me?
When I fail you, still think of me
How could you love me?
(Why would you choose to do what you do Jesus?)
How could you love me?
(I was spiritually broke)
But the debt I owed (But you paid it)
You paid it for me (How?)
How could you love me?
(You don't keep a record of my wrongs, but Jesus, I do)
I messed up so many times (That I thought)
I thought love was just a lie (But then)
'Til it hung on Calvary (Every nail)
Every nail was just for me
