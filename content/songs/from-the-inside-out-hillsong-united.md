A thousand times I've failed
Still Your Mercy remains
Should I stumble again
Still I'm caught in Your Grace
Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame
Your Will above all else
My purpose remains
The art of losing myself
In bringing You praise
Everlasting
Your Light will shine when all else fades
Never ending
Your Glory goes beyond all fame, yeah
[Refrain]
In my heart, in my soul
Well, I give You control
Consume me from the inside out, Lord
Let justice and praise
Become my embrace
To love You from the inside out
