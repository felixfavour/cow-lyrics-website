There may be storms
That won't move out the way
And trials will come
To only test my faith
What I've learned about your favor
Your mercy and your grace
Is they go on forever
They're sufficient for today
When I'm worried about tomorrow
I won't be overwhelmed
And the burdens that I've carried
I will choose to lay them down
Cause what I've learned about your favor
Your mercy and your grace
Is they go on forever
They're sufficient for today
And hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, they're sufficient for today
And hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, they're sufficient for today
In the joy and in the sorrow
I find you just the same
And behind my darkest mournings
There's a peace I can't explain
Oh, I'm so grateful for your favor
Your mercy and your grace
Cause they go on forever
They're sufficient for today
And hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, they're sufficient for today
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, they're sufficient for today
One day I'll finally see you
And my faith will be my sign
And all my prayers and sufferings
Will be gone and left behind
I'll be standing in your favor
Your mercy and your grace
Cause they go on forever
They still go on forever
Oh, they still go on forever
All, glory to your name
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, all glory to your name
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, all glory to your name
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, they're sufficient for today
And hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, they're sufficient for today
