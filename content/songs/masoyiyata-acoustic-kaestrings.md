I only see
An angel from above
When i see you
My Darling
I only see
A gift from the Lord
When i see you
My girl
Its like a dream
i'm delighted it is real
Knowing forever is with you
You're my star
My gift from the Lord
I will love you till the end
masoyiya-ta (my lover)
masoyiya-ta (my lover)
With you by my side
We'll take down ten thousand
masoyiya-ta (my lover)
masoyiya-ta (my lover)
I will forever
Love you with my all
