ways standing by, ahead of you
When you need him, ahead of you
He will never leave you down, ahead of you
So, his aheaaad, ahead of you
Who can stand up against him
What he choses to favour
When a mans way pleases the lord
He makes his enemy 
Thou I can only see what I perceive
I walk by faith and not by sight
Now but am on my knees
Am rest assured as he said to me
Am ahead of you, making every crocked way straight
He will make every, am ahead of you
Smashing down every mountains straight
How glo, how glo, am ahead of you
Giving you the treasures of darkness
And head in riches, am ahead of you
Ohhhhhhhh
Manifestation
I will go ahead of you
Even thou I walk through the shadow of death I feel no evil
I will go ahead of you
Pain may endure for the night but my God joy comes in the morning
I will go ahead of you
Ohhhhhhhhhh
I will go ahead of you
Just call my name and I will be there
I will go ahead of you
Youuuuuu
