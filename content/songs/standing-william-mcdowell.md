Can you hear the voice of the Father
Inviting you to walk the water?
Risk it all, answer the call, and enter in
Now we stand on every promise
We're not afraid, our faith goes before us
When we believe, we're gonna see
The supernatural
We're gonna see what we're praying for
We believe every single word
Stronger than we've ever been
Standing on his promises
We're gonna see the impossible
We release the supernatural
Stronger than we've ever been
We are standing on his promises
We will face the darkness around us
As we break the chains that have bound us
Oh, yes, it's true, we can do the impossible
So we stand with keys of the kingdom
To declare the day of our freedom
When we believe, we're gonna see
The supernatural
We're gonna see what we're praying for
We believe every single word
Stronger than we've ever been
Standing on his promises
We're gonna see the impossible
We release the supernatural
Stronger than we've ever been
We are standing on his promises
