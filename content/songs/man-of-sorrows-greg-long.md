Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Lord, my Lord
It makes me sick inside
To know the tears You cried
Lord, my sweet Lord
Look what they did to You
Isaiah's words was true
They stripped You naked
As the day that You were born
And then they laughed at You
And spit into Your face
Your body bleeding
From the whippings and the beatings
As they led You to that crucifying place
You were the man, man of sorrows
And I believe You're the man
You're the man, You're the man
You're the man of tomorrow
Knock, knocking at my door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Jesus, my Jesus
There was no resting place
For one so full of grace
Jesus, oh, my Jesus
It's just too much to feel
Your suffering was real
As you were hanging from the nails
They still railed on You
Hurled abuse at You
To come down from the cross
When it was done, the sun eclipsed
The rocks they trampled
Graves were opened
Through the city dead men walked
Truly, truly, Lord
You are the Son of God
