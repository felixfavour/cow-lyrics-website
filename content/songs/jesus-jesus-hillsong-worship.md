Jesus, Jesus, one touch of Your hand
I am healed and I am whole
Jesus, Jesus, one glimpse of Your face
Brings fire to my soul
And Jesus, I come
Beholding Your face
I am changed from glory to glory
And now I see, and now I know
One touch of Your life
Brings glory to my soul
Jesus, Jesus, from darkness to light
My life overflows
Jesus, Jesus, Your mercy and grace
Like a river flowing down
And Jesus, I come
Beholding Your face
I am changed from glory to glory
And now I see, and now I know
One touch of Your life
Brings glory to my soul
And now I see, and now I know
One touch of Your life
Brings glory to my soul
And now I see, and now I know
One touch of your life
Brings glory to my soul
And now I see, and now I know
One touch of Your life
Brings glory to my soul
