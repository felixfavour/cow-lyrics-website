I am not the same again
I am not the same again
Jesus, You have changed my life oh
I am not the same again
You've changed my story
I am not the same again
I am not the same again
I am not the same again
Jesus, You have changed my life oh
I am not the same again
You've changed my story
I am not the same again
Show me a man who met Jesus
And remained the same
And I'll show you a God
Who never failed and will never change
He has changed my life oh
I am not the same again
He changed my story
I am not the same again
Men may fail you
Men may disappoint
Jesus, Jesus, He remains consistent
He has changed my life oh
I am not the same again
He changed my story
I am not the same again
I am not the same again
I am not the same again
Jesus, You have changed my life oh
I am not the same again
You've changed my story
I am not the same again
I am not the same again
I am not the same again
Jesus, You have changed my life oh
I am not the same again
You've changed my story
I am not the same again

And remained the same
And I'll show you a God
Who never failed and will never change
He has changed my life oh

I'm clothed with Your love
Surrounded by Your grace
I'm caught in your mercies
All I want You've given me
You've changed me life oh
I am not the same again oh
You've changed my story for good
I'm not the same again
I'll be lying to myself
If I don't say it now
Jesus You've been good, good to me
Morning, noon and night
You have changed me life oh
I am not the same again oh
I will never be the same again
I am not the same again
I am not the same again
Jesus, You have changed my life oh
I am not the same again
You've changed my story
I am not the same again
I am not the same again
I am not the same again
Jesus, You have changed my life oh
I am not the same again
You've changed my story
I am not the same again
I am not the same again
I am not the same again
Jesus, You have changed my life oh
I am not the same again
You've changed my story
I am not the same again
