[Chorus]
I give myself away
I give myself away
So you can use me
I give myself away
I give myself away
So you can use me
Here I am
Here I stand
Lord, my life is in your hands
Lord, I'm longing to see
Your desires revealed in me
I give myself away
Take my heart
Take my life
As a living sacrifice
All my dreams, all my plans
Lord I place them in your hands
[Chorus: x2]
[Repeat: x7]
My life is not my own
To you I belong
I give myself
I give myself to you
