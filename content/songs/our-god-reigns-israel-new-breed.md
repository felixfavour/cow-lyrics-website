Our God is great and Glorious
We put our trust in Your Name, Jesus
Able to save and deliver us
We put our hope in Your Name, Jesus
[Pre-Chorus: Israel & New Breed and BJ Putnam]
Blessing and honor, glory and power
Unto our God forever and ever
All of the honor, all of the praise is Yours, Yours forever
[Chorus: Israel & New Breed and BJ Putnam]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Our God reigns
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Our God reigns
Our God is mighty and marvelous
We put our trust in Your Name, Jesus
Nothing to fear, You are here with us
We put our hope in Your Name, Jesus
[Bridge: Israel & New Breed and BJ Putnam]
Our God is in control
Steadfast, unmovable
Nothing's impossible
Our God reigns forever
