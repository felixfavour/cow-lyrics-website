[Chorus]
Your Grace is sufficient for me
Your Strength is made perfect when I am weak
All that I cling to I lay at your feet
Your Grace is sufficient for me
Your Grace is sufficient for me
Your Strength is made perfect when I am weak
All that I cling to I lay at your feet
Your Grace is sufficient for me
I'm no longer striving to merit Your love
I rest in Your promise to me
That all of my sins have been washed in your blood
Your mercy is all that I need
Your Grace is sufficient for me
Your Strength is made perfect when I am weak
All that I cling to I lay at your feet
Your Grace is sufficient for me
You see me as righteous because of the blood
That made the atonement for me
Your mercy has triumphed where I should be judged
So now by your grace I am free
