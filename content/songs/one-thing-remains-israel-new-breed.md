Higher than the mountains that I face
Stronger than the power of the grave
Constant through the trial and the change
One thing remains
Your love never fails, never gives up
Never runs out on me
On and on and on and on it goes
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I never, ever have to be afraid
One thing remains
[Bridge]
In death, in life, I'm confident and
Covered by the power of Your great love
My debt is paid, there's nothing that can
Separate my heart from Your great love
