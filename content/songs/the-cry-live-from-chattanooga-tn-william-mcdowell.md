There is a cry
That comes from our hearts
To the One who can satisfy it all
He will answer when we call
There is a sound
Released from the depths of our souls
To the One who holds it all
He will answer when we call
There is a cry
That comes from our hearts
To the One who can satisfy it all
He will answer when we call
There is a sound
Released from the depths of our souls
To the One who holds it all
Hе will answer when we call
So wе cry with humble expectation
We cry with a sound of desperation
We'll cry 'til we get Your attention
Lord, come have Your way
And show us Your glory
