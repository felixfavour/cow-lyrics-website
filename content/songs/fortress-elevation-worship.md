When my fear is overwhelming
On Your promise I will stand
You are faithful to the end
When my enemies surround me
I am safe within Your hand
You are faithful to the end
And when the battle comes
I know You’re my defender
A mighty fortress is Our God
And when the victory’s won
I know I’ll still be standing
A mighty fortress is Our God
Let Your presence go before me
Into places I can’t see
You are everything I need
Let my weakness show Your glory
And my scars declare Your strength
You are everything I need
And when the battle comes
I know You’re my defender
A mighty fortress is Our God
And when the victory’s won
I know I’ll still be standing
A mighty fortress is Our God
And when the battle comes
I know You’re my defender
A mighty fortress is Our God
And when the victory’s won
I know I’ll still be standing
A mighty fortress is Our God
