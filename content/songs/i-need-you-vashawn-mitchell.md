There is no way I can make it without you
I can't go on without the Lord on my side
Everyday and every way
I need You
You and only You
I need You
(Repeat)
Leader: You are my strength, Jesus
Strength like no other you are
Leader: And you are my source O God
Source of my life O God I
Leader: I put my trust in you
All my faith in you
I know you will come through
There is no way I can make it without you
I can't go on without the Lord on my side
Everyday and every way
I need You
You and only You
I need You
Leader: You are my strength, Jesus yeah
Strength like no other you are
