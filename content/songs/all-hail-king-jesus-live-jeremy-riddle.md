There was a moment when the lights went out
When death had claimed its victory
The King of love had given up His life
The darkest day in history
There on a cross, they made for sinners
For every curse, His blood atoned
One final breath and it was finished
But not the end we could have known
[Pre-Chorus 1]
For the earth began to shake, and the veil was torn
What sacrifice was made, as the Heavens roared
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Lord of Heaven and earth
All hail, King Jesus
All hail the Savior of the world
The Savior of the world
There was a moment when the sky lit up
A flash of light breaking through
When all was lost He crossed eternity
The King of life was on the move
