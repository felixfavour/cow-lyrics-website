Fear not, we are redeemed
God has called us by name
Cleansed us in righteousness
And removed all our shame
Those who are blind, now can see
The deaf have ears
That they may now hear
The lame, they're now made
To pick up their beds
And to me he's given sweet liberty
Fear not, we are redeemed
God has called us by name
Cleansed us in righteousness
And removed all our shame
Redemption has come
Through his precious blood
Jesus died for us out of love
God knew of our sin
The great and the small
Yet still his grace covers it all
Fear not, we are redeemed, redeemed
Bought by the blood of the lamb
Fear not, we are redeemed, redeemed
Bought by the blood of the lamb
