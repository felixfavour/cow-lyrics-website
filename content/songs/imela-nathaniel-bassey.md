When I think upon Your goodness
And Your faithfulness each day
I'm convinced it's not because I am worthy
To receive the kind of love that You give
But I'm grateful for Your mercy
And I'm grateful for Your grace
And because of how You've poured out your Yourself
I have come to sing this song out in praise
Imela, Imela
Okaka, Onyekeruwa
Imela, Imela
Eze mo
Who am I to sing Your praises?
Who am I to worship You?
Its Your blood that makes the difference in me
And made a way to enter into Your thronе
I could not come near Your presеnce
I could never sing Your song
But the sacrifice on Calvary's tree
Is the reason I can cry out today
Imela, Imela
Okaka, Oyenkeruwa
Imela, Imela
Eze mo
Imela, Imela
Okaka, Oyenkeruwa
Imela, Imela
Eze mo
