[Intro: Ryan Ofei & Mav City Gospel Choir]
Hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Take me from where I am
Into Your promised land (Alright)
Guide me by Your great hand
Wherever You go, I'll follow
Break off my yesterday
Praying for brighter days
Running with no restraints
Wherever You go, I'll follow
[Chorus: Ryan Ofei & Bri Babineaux]
Gone are the chains that were holding me
Gone is the person I used to be
Freed from the fear by Your perfect love
This is my exodus
This is my exodus
[Interlude: Ryan Ofei, Israel Houghton, Bri Babineaux]
Hey, yeah (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Oh, woah
Woah
