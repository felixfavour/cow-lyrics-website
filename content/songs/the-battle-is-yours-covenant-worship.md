Your name
Is a shelter through the night 
And I am running to
Your name 
Is a place that I can hide 
And I will rest in You
Your grace 
Is a force that speaks for me 
And I am standing on
Your grace 
Has given all authority 
For You have made me strong
[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, oh-oh-oh 
I remain victorious 
Oh, oh-oh-oh 
In the name of Jesus
No weapon formed against us
Can stop the blood of Jesus 
We will not fear the darkness 
The battle, is Yours
