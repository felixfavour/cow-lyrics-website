[Chorus]
Jesus the same
Yesterday, today and forevermore
No other name
That can save, deliver and restore (Oh oh oh)
Jesus the same
Yesterday, today and forevermore
There is no other name that is greater than Jesus
[Interlude]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
'eah, ('eah), 'eah
Whoa-oh-oh-oh (Whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Faithful, powerful, wonderful
Jesus is
Beautiful, merciful
Supernatural, Jesus is
He's highly, mighty, worthy
Jesus is
Gracious, patient, generous
And there is no other name that is greater than Jesus
Jesus the same
Yesterday, today and forevermore
No other name
That can save, deliver and restore (Oh oh oh)
Jesus the same
Yesterday, today and forevermore
There is no other name that is greater than Jesus
