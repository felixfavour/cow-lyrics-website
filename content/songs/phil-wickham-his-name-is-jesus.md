The King is in the room
Come see the scars of love upon His hands
The King is in the room
We'll watch the darkness flee at His command
Who is this King?
Who is this King?
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
Light of the world
There's freedom in His name
Awesome in power
Reigning forever
Light of the world
There's freedom in His name
The Healer's in the room
Let miracles break out across this place, oh
The Savior's in the room
No soul beyond the boundaries of His grace
There's resurrection power in His name
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
Light of the world
There's freedom in His name
Awesome in power
Reigning forever
Light of the world
There's freedom in His name
There's freedom in His name
Oh, there's freedom in His name
There's never been a love so great
He died so we could live
Then He rose up from that grave
Name another King like this
Now all authority
Forever belongs to Him
He reigns in victory
Name another King like this
There's never been a love so great
He died so we could live
Then He rose up from that grave
Name another King like this
Now all authority
Forever belongs to Him
He reigns in victory
Name another King like this
Yeah!
Name another King like this
Who is this King?
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
Light of the world
There's freedom in His name
Awesome in power
Reigning forever
Light of the world
There's freedom in His name
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
Light of the world
There's freedom in His name
Awesome in power
Reigning forever
Light of the world
There's freedom in His name
There's never been a love so great
He died so we could live
Then He rose up from that grave
Name another King like this
Now all authority
Forever belongs to Him
He reigns in victory
Name another King
There's never been a King like this
There's never been a King like this, oh
His name is Jesus
