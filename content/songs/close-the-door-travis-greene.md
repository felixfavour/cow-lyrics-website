World is going crazy (Crazy)
Trouble’s all around, can’t find hope
They tell me if I keep my distance and I listen
To the latest news, I’ll be safe home
But I feel like it’s a movie
And the credits should be up, takin' too long
If I never see the end of the film that I’m in
Is it possible to press pause, hold on?
[Chorus: Travis Greene]
When I close the door
I find what I’ve been looking for
And my faith will get stronger
When I close the door
I find what I’ve been looking for
And my faith will get stronger
Yes, when I
Swing in from a distance
Watch ’em all on social, go loco
Spirits with prеscriptions (Yeah)
Verses wе go knuckle for knuckle
Yeah, they knock ’em down, we get up though
And if the spirit come, could be trouble (Woo)
For my brother like a stunt double
I’ma find that needle in the stubble, oh (
Now I'm fine
)
I believe You’re making it better now
Yeah, I believe You’re 
makin' it better now
Surely, I believe You’re working it out some
How in a war, Lord? How in a closed door?
Coming out of this storm, Lord
With praise and when I close the door (
Close the door
)
Ooh, I find what I’ve been lookin' for (Oh)
And my 
faith will get stronger
