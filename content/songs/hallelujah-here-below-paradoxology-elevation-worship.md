We are an altar of broken stones
But You delight in the offering
You have the heavens to call Your home
But You abide in the song we sing
Ten thousand angels surround Your throne
To bring You praise that will never cease
But hallelujah from here below
Is still Your favourite melody
We sing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
And should the fire that once burned bright
Become an ember my eyes can't see
I will remember Your sacrifice
I will abide in Your love for me
Oh, we sing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
We sing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
