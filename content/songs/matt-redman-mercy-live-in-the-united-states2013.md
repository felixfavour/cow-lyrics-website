Verse 1]
I will kneel in the dust
At the foot of the cross
Where mercy paid for me
Where the wrath I deserve
It is gone, it has passed
Your blood has hidden me

Mercy, mercy
As endless as the sea
I'll sing Your hallelujah
For all eternity
We will lift up the cup
And the bread we will break
Remembering Your love
We were fallen from grace
But You took all our shame
And nailed it to a cross

Mercy, mercy
As endless as the sea
I'll sing Your hallelujah
For all eternity
Mercy, mercy
As endless as the sea
I'll sing Your hallelujah
For all eternity

May I never lose the wonder
Oh, the wonder of Your mercy
May I sing Your hallelujah
Hallelujah, Amen
May I never lose the wonder
Oh, the wonder of Your mercy
May I sing Your hallelujah
Hallelujah, Amen
Oh, may I never lose the wonder
Oh, the wonder of Your mercy
May I sing Your hallelujah
Hallelujah, Amen

[Bridge]
May I never lose the wonder
Oh, the wonder of Your mercy
May I sing Your hallelujah
Hallelujah, Amen
May I never lose the wonder
Oh, the wonder of Your mercy
May I sing Your hallelujah
Hallelujah, Amen

I will kneel in the dust
