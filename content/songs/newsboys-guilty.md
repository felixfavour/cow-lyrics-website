When did it become breaking a rule
To say your name out loud in school
When your name's the only one that sets us free?
When did it become incorrect
To speak the truth about life and death
When your life gave us all eternity?
Even if it gets me convicted
I'll be on my knees with my hands lifted
If serving you's against the law of man
If living out my faith in you is banned
Then I'll stand right before the jury
If saying "I believe" is out of line
If I'm judged 'cause I'm gonna give my life
To show the world the love that fills me
Then I wanna be guilty
I'll rise up and honor you
I'll testify to the good you do
'Cos your grace and your mercy have overtaken me
So even if it gets me convicted
I'll be on my knees with my hands lifted
If serving you's against the law of man
If living out my faith in you is banned
Then I'll stand right before the jury
If saying "I believe" is out of line
If I'm judged 'cos I'm gonna give my life
To show the world the love that fills me
Then I wanna be guilty by association
Guilty of being a voice proclaiming
Your ways, your truth, your life
I'll pay the price to be your light
If serving you's against the law of man
If living out my faith in you is banned
Then I'll stand right before the jury
If saying "I believe" is out of line
If I'm judged 'cos I'm gonna give my life
To show the world the love that fills me
Then I wanna be guilty by association
Guilty of being a voice proclaiming
Your ways, your truth, your life
I'll pay the price to be your light
Oh, I wanna be guilty
