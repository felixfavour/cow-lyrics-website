Better than the riches of this world
Better than the sound of my friend's voices
Better than the biggest dreams in my heart
That's just the start
Better than getting what I say I need
Better than living the life that I want to
Better than the love anyone could give
Your love is
[Pre-Chorus]
You hold me now in Your arms and never let me go
And You oh Lord make the sun shine
And the moonlight in the night sky
You give me breath and all Your love
I give my heart to You because
I can't stop falling in love with You
I'll never stop falling in love with You
Better than the riches of this world
Better than the sound of my friend's voices
Better than the biggest dreams in my heart
And that's just the start
