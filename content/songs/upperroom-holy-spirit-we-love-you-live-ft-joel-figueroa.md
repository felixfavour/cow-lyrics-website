Holy Spirit (We Love You)"
When you come everything just makes sense
You show up and hearts begin to sing again
We're in awe, gathered here together for you
Just for you
Sing, when you come...
When you come everything just makes sense
You show up and hearts begin to sing again
We're in awe, gathered here together for you
Just for you
Oh oh oh oh
Holy Spirit, we love you
All your ways are perfect
Holy Spirit, we honor you
In this place have your way God
Holy Spirit, we dedicate this song to you
And you are here breaking all the boxes with love
And you are close, satisfying longings inside
And as you move, we anticipate what you'll do
Cause you're so good
Cause you are here breaking all the boxes with love
And you are close, satisfying longings inside
And as you move, we anticipate what you'll do
Cause you're so good
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, Holy Spirit
Holy Spirit, we love you
All your ways are perfect
Holy Spirit, we honor you
In this place have your way God, Holy Spirit
Holy Spirit, we love you
All your ways are perfect, yes they are
Holy Spirit, we honor you
In this place have your way God, in this place
In this place have your way God

And Holy Spirit, we love your ways
You're the freedom in this place
Holy Spirit, we love your ways
You're the freedom in this place, Holy Spirit
Holy Spirit, we love your ways
You're the freedom in this place
Holy Spirit, we love your ways
You're the freedom in this place
Holy Spirit, we love your ways
You're the freedom in this place
Holy Spirit, we love your ways
You're the freedom in this place
Holy Spirit, we love your ways
You're the freedom in this place
