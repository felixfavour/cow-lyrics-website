i have made you too small in my eyes
oh lord forgive me
and i have believed in my life
 that you were unable to help me
but now ,oh lord i see my wrong
hear my heart and show yourself strong
and in my eyes and with my soul
oh lord be magnified oh lord be magnified
 (chorus)
be magnified oh Lord
you are highly exalted
and there is nothing you can do
oh lord my eyes are on you
be magnified
oh Lord be magnified (repeated)
