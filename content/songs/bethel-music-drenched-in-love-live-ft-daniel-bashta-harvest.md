"Drenched In Love"
(performed by Daniel Bashta & Harvest)
Oh precious
We're singing
Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
All souls atoned, by the blood of the Lamb
I'm not a slave to what, once held me damned
How beautiful, that cleansing flood
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
We're singing
Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ohh
All filth made clean, in that crimson sea
I'm not ashamed of what, once shackled me
How infinite, that grace divine
I am free, I am free
I am a child of God
We're singing
Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ohh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ohh
And how priceless, how precious
There is power in the blood of Jesus
And how priceless, how precious
There is power in the blood of Jesus
And how priceless, how precious
There is power in the blood of Jesus (There is power)
And how priceless, how precious
There is power in the blood of Jesus
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
There is power, power, wonder-working power
In the blood of the Lamb
I was buried deep, with Christ my Lord
Now I'm raised to life, forevermore
My name's been carved, upon Your heart
No not death, no not hell could ever keep us apart!
We're singing
Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
We're singing
Oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
And oh precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
I am washed, I am washed
I am drenched in love
