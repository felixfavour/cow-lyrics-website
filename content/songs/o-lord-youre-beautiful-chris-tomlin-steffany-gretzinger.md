O Lord, You're beautiful
Your face is all I seek
And when Your eyes are on this child
Your grace abounds to me
O Lord, You're beautiful
Your face is all I seek
And when Your eyes are on this child
Your grace abounds to me
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin]
I want to take Your word and shine it all around
First help me to just to live it, Lord
And when I'm doing well, help me to never seek a crown
For my reward is giving glory to You
O Lord, please light the fire (
Light the fire
)
That once burned bright and clear
Replace the lamp 
of my first love
That burns with holy fear
Oh
 (Oh)
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin 
& Steffany Gretzinger
]
And when I'm doing well, help me to never seek a crown
For my reward
 is giving 
glory to You
