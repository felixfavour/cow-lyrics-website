Come see the Baby
Crib for a Bed
His mother Mary
Lay down His sweet head
The starlight was shining
The wise men were led
Come see the baby
And worship Him
His name is wonderful, counselor
Mighty God, Prince of Peace
Everlasting Father
Emmanuel
Holy One, Son of God
Savior of the world
Come and adore Him
On bended Knee
He came to Ransom
Someone like me
What could I offer
What could I bring
Come and adore Him
King of Kings
