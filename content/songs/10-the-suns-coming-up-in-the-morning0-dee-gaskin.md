Once again I face satan this morning.
And I battled him all the day long.
But in my weakness God sends reinforcements. And at sun down I'll sing victory's song.

And the sun's coming up in the morning. Every tear well be gone from my eyes. This old clay is gonna give away to glory. And like an eagle I'll take to the sky.

In a world filled with doubts and confusion. It's so hard when you don't understand. But I'm standing on a solid foundation. And I hold to an unchanging hand.

And the sun's coming up in the morning. Every tear well be gone from my eyes. This old clay is gonna give away to glory. And like an eagle I'll take to the sky.
