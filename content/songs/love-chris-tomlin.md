[Intro]
There is love, there is love [x2]
When our hope is hard to find
And our faith is in decline
We need a cause to stand behind - love
We all want the way it feels
Time it comes and time it steals
What remains, what is real - love
There is love
There is forgiveness
There is love in times of need
When life is cold there is a promise
You will never go without...
There is love
There is love
It heals the sick
Comforts the weak
Breaks the proud
Raises the meek
In this life no guarantees...
