Oh Lord You have shown Your favour
Your every word stands true
I'mfound safe within in Your harbour
Anchored deep in You
You washed away my tears
Gave me joy and freedom
Lifting me through the years
Your love is stronger than
The sound of heaven'spraises
Higher than
The lofty mountain peaks
Deeper than
The deepest ocean valleys
Strong enough for me
