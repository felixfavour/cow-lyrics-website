In the midst of the darkness
You're the light that guides me through
Our eyes are on You
You are near to the broken
The weak find their strength in You
Our eyes are on You
When I'm lost in the madness
You're the peace that calms my soul
Our eyes are on You
You bring hope to the hopeless
You're the love that won't let go
Our eyes are on You
We lift our eyes to You
Where our help comes from
Our hope is found in You
Jesus, Lord of all
We lift our eyes to You
Exalted One
Exalted One
In the midst of the darkness
You're the light that guides me through
Our eyes are on You
You are near to the broken
The weak find their strength in You
Our eyes are on You
