Creation knows the voice
That spoke into the void
The breath that brought the dust to life
And sang the stars to form
The darkness fears Your voice
That drove it back before
And though the night is long, I know Your light
Will drive it back once more
One word from You
Things change on Your authority
Your word, it's true
Things change on Your authority
My fight is not my own
It's end is in Your hands
I worship You because I know all things
Must bow to Your command
One word from You
Things change on Your authority
Your word, it's true
Things change on Your authority
