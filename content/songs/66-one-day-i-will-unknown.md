I have never seen the face of my Savior; but serving Him's been such a thrill. I have never seen the gates to that city; Oh, but one day, one day I will!

One day I'm going to walk on the streets of pure gold; and they tell me the half has never yet been told. I'll be united with loved ones on Zion's holy hill; Yes, one day, one day I will. 

From the time I first met Him He's been all to me, and my life with His joy He has filled. And I'm longing for the day when my eyes shall behold Him. Thank God, one day, one day I will!

One day I'm going to walk on the streets of pure gold; and they tell me the half has never yet been told. I'll be united with loved ones on Zion's holy hill; Yes, one day, one day I will.
