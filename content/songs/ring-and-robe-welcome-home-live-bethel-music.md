This may be a song that the captives can't yet sing
But if we sing long enough, they might join in with us
And this may be a dance that's too heavy for those chains
But if we dance long enough, all the prisons will open up, hey!
This may be a shout that those fragile ones can't bear
But if we shout long enough, oh, the walls might finally fall
And they may need some help to lift their hands up in the air
But we know that freedom's coming, so we'll sing it all the more
[Chorus: Dante Bowe]
We're singing oh-oh-oh
The redeemed now have a song
We'll sing it all day long
Until the rеst come running home
And oh-oh-oh
All the brokеn, can you hear?
We'll shout it out forever
Can't wait 'till you make it here
Sing it out, say
[Post-Chorus: Dante Bowe]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
