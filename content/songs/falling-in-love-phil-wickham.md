So much beauty to discover
I can hardly take it in
I will ever stand in wonder
Of a grace that never ends
The more I praise You
The more I want to
I'm falling in love
Falling in love with You
I lay my life down
God, I am Yours now
I'm falling in love
Falling in love with You
We have barely scratched the surface
Of Your death-defying love
Every breath I have is worth it
A thousand songs are not enough (Oh-oh-oh)
The more I praise You (Oh)
The more I want to
I'm falling in love
Falling in love with You (Oh-oh-oh)
I lay my life down (Oh)
God, I am Yours now
I'm falling in lovе
Falling in love with You
Yes, I am falling in love
Falling in lovе with You
