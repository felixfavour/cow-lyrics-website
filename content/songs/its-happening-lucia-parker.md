V1
When   you   move   all   creation   moves   with   you,   with   you When   you   speak   all   of   Heaven's   speaking   too,   with   you When   you   fall,   when   your   glory   falls
And   everything   is   new
You   are   here,   you   are   here   with   us
And   we   respond   to   You
Chorus
Oh   the   heavens   have   been   open
And   we’re   standing   in   a   moment
And   the   promise   you   have   spoken
Is   Happening,   it’s   happening
Your   love   is   overtaking
The   atmosphere   is   changing
Revival   is   awaking
/It’s   happening/
V2
When   you   move   all   creation   moves   with   you,   with   you When   you   speak   all   of   Heaven's   speaking   too,   with   you Never   change   yet   you're   changing   us   and   making   us   like   you
In   Your   name,   in   Your   name   we   trust   there's   nothing   you   can't   do
Bridge
Fall   let   it   fall   let   Your   fire   fall   &
Burn   let   it   burn   let   us   see   revival
Come   let   it   come   let   your   spirit   come
It's   happening,   it's   happening.
