Hark! The herald angels sing:
"Glory to the newborn King"Peace on earth and mercy child
God and sinner reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic hosts proclaim:
"Christ is born in Bethlehem"Hark! The herald angels sing:
"Glory to the newborn King"Christ by highest heaven adored
Christ the everlasting Lord
Late in time, behold Him come
Offspring of the virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate deity
Pleased as man in flesh to dwell
Jesus our Emmanuel
Hark! The herald angels sing:
"Glory to the newborn King"Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark! The herald angels sing:
"Glory to the newborn King"
