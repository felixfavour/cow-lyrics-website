My Father, I adore You more
Than anything my heart could wish for
I just want You and Jesus, my beloved Savior
Everything I am, I owe to You, I owe it all to You
And angels come and adore You
And we, Your children worship You
You are my world, You are my God
And I lay down my life for You
You are my Lord the One I love
No one could ever take Your place
And everything I have, I give to You
My Lord, the One I live for, I live for You
And all my days are gifts from You
I pray I'd use them as You want me to
Use them for You
And angels come and adore You
And we Your children worship You
You are my world, You are my God
And I lay down my life for You
You are my Lord, the One I love
No one could ever take Your place
You are my world, You are my God
And I lay down my life for You
You are my Lord, the One I love
No one could ever take Your place
And angels come and adore You
And we Your children worship You
You are my world, You are my God
And I lay down my life for You
You are my Lord, the One I love
No one could ever take Your place
You are my world, You are my God
And I lay down my life for You
You are my Lord, the One I love
No one could ever take Your place
You are my world, You are my God
And I lay down my life for You
You are my Lord, the One I love
No one could ever take Your place
