God will always be my story
Nothing less than Christ my Saviour
God will always be my hope
Nothing more than Christ alone
And this will be my story
And this will be my song
My chains are broken
I am free
And this will be my story
And this will be my song
I'll praise You, my Saviour
Jesus
Take my life but give me Jesus
To know You God is why I live
Take the world but give me Jesus
For all my days, I'll follow You
And this will be my story
And this will be my song
My chains are broken
I am free
And this will be my story
And this will be my song
I'll praise You, my Saviour
Jesus
