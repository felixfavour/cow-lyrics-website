Esin mefa o sare to
When the Spirit is upon me
Leave them make them carry go
I will surely outrun them
Cos Oluwa is involved, involved, involved
So I don't listen to the noise
Plenty chariots dey run for my front
But when I begin my run
E go be like say I dey on steroids
Elijah Level
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
Is my normal level
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
So I'm more than able
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
Cos the Spirit is upon me (He's upon me)
Elijah Level
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
Is my normal level
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
Oh I'm more than able
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
Cos the Spirit is upon me (He's upon me)
Zoom Zoom Zoom what's that?
Oh that's me on a race track
And I dey call heaven
Keke Elijah gbemi sare jo
Na like this the matter dey
Them no fit Calcu' my pace
My channels, no man can trace
No chariots faster than grace
I'm on a new level
Even this one go soon be old level
Cos my path shines brighter and brighter till the perfect day
Cos Oluwa is involved, involved, involved
So I no listen to the noise
Plenty chariots dey run for my front
But when I begin my run
E go be like say I dey on steroids
Elijah Level
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
Is my normal level
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
So I'm more than able
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
Cos the Spirit is upon me (He's upon me)
Elijah Level
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
Is my normal level
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
I am more than able
Awa'n sare ju Ferrari lo
Cos the Spirit is upon me (He's upon me)
