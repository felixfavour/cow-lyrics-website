Seek ye first the kingdom of God
And His righteousness;
And all these things shall be added unto you
Hallelu, Hallelujah!
Ask, and it shall be given unto you;
Seek, and you shall find
Knock, and it shall be opened unto you
Hallelu, Hallelujah!
Man shall not live by bread alone
But by every word
That proceeds out from the mouth of God
Hallelu, Hallelujah!
