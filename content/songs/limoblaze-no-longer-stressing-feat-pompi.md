r: Limoblaze]
[al: The Wait]
Me I no Dey do Americana [00:10]
Shout out to my homies in Kampala [00:13]
Yea my cup is steady running over [00:15]
But I wrote this for the ones way get Palava [00:17]
Because I know say who send me [00:20]
Always get plans way cover me [00:23]
So thereï¿½s nothing thatï¿½s stressing me yo [00:25]
Make I tell you whatï¿½s stressing you out [00:27]
You easily getting drowned in emotions [00:29]
You carry the weight the size of an ocean [00:31]
Youï¿½re trynna play God and now you roasting me and my Gees we be coasting [00:34]
[00:39][00:46]Chorus :
We no longer stressing [00:39]
Put faith in Jah go home me are resting [00:40]
Everyday a holiday now
Me are flexing [00:42]
Likkle likkle thing Jah do is a blessing [00:45]
We no longer stressing
Put faith in Jah go home me are resting
Everyday a holiday now
Me are flexing
Likkle likkle thing Jah do is a blessing
[00:59] Second verse:
I hope you know you're not the underdog
Sling shots but they're hitting like they're canon balls
Found rest in the name not SantaClaus
And the Easter bunnys definately not involved
Yeah we doing the most
Negative thoughts I am a terrible host
Living by faith in Christ we boast
Like a snail moonwalking on a piller of salt
His favour have you heard of this
The enemy be like hah never "hespered it"
Begun from the end you can't handle this
Cos he wrote it from revelations to Genesis
I reap for the benefits
According to the master plan
Sow seed, my seed is a 10 in percentages
So Oluwa he gon bless the man
[01:37][01:47]Chorus :
We no longer stressing
Put faith in Jah go home me are resting
Everyday a holiday now
Me are flexing
Likkle likkle thing Jah do is a blessing
We no longer stressing
Put faith in Jah go home me are resting
Everyday a holiday now
Me are flexing
Likkle likkle thing Jah do is a blessing
Iï¿½m a goal getter and a sharp shooter eh [01:58]
Iï¿½m a dream chaser number 1 in the game [02:00]
And I run around the city dropping blockbusters eh [02:03]
Blockbusters eh [02:05]
But e be Jah way Dey bless person [02:07]
When the matter don hard [02:09]
You Dey help person [02:10]
They can do what they like [02:11]
Me Iï¿½m not stressing [02:12]
Imma hold you tight [02:13]
