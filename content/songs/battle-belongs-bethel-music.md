When all I see is the battle
You see my victory
When all I see is the mountain
You see a mountain moved
And as I walk through the shadow
Your love surrounds me
For there is nothing to fear now
For I am safe with You
So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees
With my hands lifted high
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
And every fear I lay at Your feet
I'll sing through the night
Oh God, the battle belongs to You
And if You are for me
Who can be against me?
For Jesus, there's nothing
Impossible for You
When all I see are the ashes
You see the beauty
(You see the beauty)
When all I see is a cross
God, You see the empty tomb
