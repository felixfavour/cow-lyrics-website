A thousand generations
falling down in worship
to sing a song of ages to the Lamb

And all who've gone before us
and all who will believe
will sing a song of ages to the Lamb

Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all

All thrones and dominions
all powers and positions
Your name stands above them all 

And the angels cry, Holy
All creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy Forever

If you've been forgiven and
if you've been redeemed
sing a song forever to the Lamb

If you walk in freedom and
if you bear His name
Sing a song forever to the Lamb
We'll sing the song forever and amen

And the angels cry, Holy
All creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy Forever

Hear your people sing, Holy
To the King of Kings, Holy
You will always be, Holy
Holy forever

Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all

All thrones and dominions
all powers and positions
Your name stands above them all 

And the angels cry, Holy
All creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy Forever

Hear your people sing, Holy
To the King of Kings, Holy
You will always be, Holy
Holy forever
