Running over o
Running over o
I am tired of the ordinary, there's deeper still
I am tired of the ordinary, there's deeper still
Lord, I am tired of the ordinary, show us what you desire
I am tired of the ordinary, there's deeper still
I am tired of the ordinary, there's deeper still
I am tired of the ordinary, show us what you desire
I am tired of the ordinary, there's deeper still (still)
I am tired of the ordinary
(Jesus, Abundant life)
Abundant life (Show us what you desire)
Is found in you ( I am tired of the ordinary, there's deeper, deeper still)
Jesus, Abundant life (I am tired of the ordinary, there's deeper still)
Is found in you
See the waters rising from the temple
Is found in you
See abundance rising from within
Till it's running over
Till it's running over
Moses Bliss - One Yes
See the waters rising from the temple
See abundance (there's water riding from within)
Till it's running over
Till it's running over
I am tired of the ordinary, there's deeper still
I am tired of the ordinary, there's deeper still
Abundant life (abundant life)
Is found in you
You are both the desire
And the satisfaction, it's found in you.
It's found in you
It's found in you
It's found in you
You are the hunger o (You are the hunger)
You are the bread o (You are the bread o)
It's found in you
It's found in you
It's found in you
Jesus, Abundant life is found in you
It's found in you
Abundant life is found in you
I am tired of the ordinary, there's deeper still
I am tired of the ordinary, there's deeper still
Abundant life, it's found in you.
That is the experience I am believing God for
Where it is all of Him and none of us
At that point, your feet is not holding ground anymore in the river
Arrive at the place where the waters themselves overflow you
Flow with the tides of that river
And as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God
If the river and the currents of it become stronger than us, then it can carry us
But if there are things that are still logical and human in our minds that hold us back
Then that river cannot carry us
The Bible says and Jesus stood on the last and the great day of the feast and cried out with a loud voice If any man thirsts, let him come to me and drink
For out of his belly (It's found in you) like the scripture has said shall flow rivers of living waters
Then the Bible says and this spake
He concerning the Holy Spirit whom them that believe shall afterwards receive
Every time we reach out to that river, what we are asking is:
Spirit take over
Spirit have your way in the earth
First, have your way in our piece of earth (It's found in you)
Then have your way in our Nation
Have your way in our economy
Have your way within our systems
Have your way in the systems with which we raise our children (Jesus, abundant life)
Have your way so that the Spirit of God rules again in the earth (It's found in you)
So that the power of God is seen again to the ends of the earth
So that there will be no day in the earth that the Spirit does not rule (It's found in you)
For every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord (Jesus is Lord)
