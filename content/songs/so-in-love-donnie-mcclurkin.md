I wanna sing
A song from the heart of God
I wanna sing, yeah
When I found you, you were all alone
All of your strength and hope was gone, yes
I gave you my heart to help you carry on
And then you turned and walked away
But I stayed right by your side
Many nights I sat with you and cried
Still you turned around and grew mad at me
But I still stayed, I stayed, yeah
Tell me what I did to you
To make you do me like you do me
All I did was try to prove
Oh, wanna prove to you that I love you, yeah
Tell me what I have to give
In order for you to believe
Believe me, that I'll never leave
Believe me when I say that I love you so
That I love you
I really really love you, child
Gave everything for you
Wait a minute now
