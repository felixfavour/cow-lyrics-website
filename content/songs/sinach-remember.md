Baba, baba, baba
You're the one who goes before me through all seasons
I won because You brought me through
Even now my voice I raise to thank You, Jesus
I praise you God, You are faithful
I remember what You did before
You will do it again (do it again)
I remember what You did before
You will do it again
My latter shall be greater
From glory to glory
My latter shall be greater
From glory to glory
You're the one who goes before me through all seasons
I won because You brought me through
Even now my voice I raise to thank You, Jesus
I praise you God, You are faithful
Lord, I remember what You did before
You will do it again (do it again)
I remember what You did before
You will do it again
My latter shall be greater
From glory to glory
My latter shall be greater
From glory to glory
You did it before
It's already done
Lord, you said it is finished
I say Amen
You're a faithful God
January to December
Lord, You said it is finished
I say Amen
Over my family, Amen
Over my business, Amen
This year, it shall be greater
I say Amen
Over my finances, Amen
Everything concerning me, Amen
This year, shall be greater
I say amen
Remember what He did before
He will do much more
Your latter shall be greater
From glory to glory
Say my latter shall be greater
From glory to glory
It shall be greater
From glory to glory
