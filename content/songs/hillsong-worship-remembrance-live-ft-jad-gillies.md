I take the bread of life
broken for all my sin
your body crucified
to make me whole again
I will recall the cup
poured out in sacrifice
to trade the sinners ?
for your new covenant
hallelujah
I'll live my life in remembrance
hallelujah
ur promise I won't forget
I walk salvation's road
with fear and trembling
your ? is my own
as Christ is found in me
hallelujah
I'll live my life in remembrance
hallelujah
ur promise I won't forget
if ever I should loose my way
if ever I deny your grace
remind me of the price you paid
hallelujah
I'll live in remembrance
you've been so so good to me
you've so so good to me
oh to think where I would be
if not for you
if not for you
you've been so so good to me
 so so good to me
oh to think where I would be
if not for you
if not for you
you've been so so good to me
 so so good to me
oh to think where I would be
if not for you
if not for you
as far as hands reach from the depth
as far as East is from the West
so far your grace has carried me
until I see you face to face
until at last I win my race
remind me of ???
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
I'll live in remembrance
