*lyrics not final
I was a prisoner
Trapped in my head and in my past
Can't believe I believed all the lies of the enemy
There is a chain breaker
Who came to set me free from that
When You did what You did, how could I ever go back?
I hear keys coming
Open up prison doors
Every chain broken
He's here, He's here
I hear keys coming
Open up prison doors
Every chain broken
He's here, He's here now
I've done some crazy things
Fell down a lot along the way
But that never changed, never changed what You thought of me
Now that's ancient history
No, it's not my identity
I believe, I believe what You say about me
