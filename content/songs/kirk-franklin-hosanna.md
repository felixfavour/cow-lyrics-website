The angels bow down at the thought of you.
The darkness gives way to the light for you
The price that you paid gives us life brand new.
Hosanna forever we worship you, hosanna forever we worship you
The angels bow down at the thought of you
The darkness gives way to the light for you
The price that you paid gives us life brand new
Hosanna forever we worship you, hosanna forever we worship you.
For you are the joy that my soul adores
The lamb that was slain for my sins, and the one, I adore, king of kings and the one I believe
Hosanna forever we worship you, hosanna forever we worship you.
For your patience and kindness and favour and mercy and honour and glory because you are worthy
we can't live without you, we can't breathe without you, we can't sleep without you
Hosanna, hosanna
No greater love in this world buh you.
No one can compare to the things you do
Wherever you go, I will follow you
Hosanna forever we worship you, hosanna forever we worship you.
The day of return shall be blessing which has greater house than the on
Hosanna forever we worship you, hosanna forever we worship you
hosanna forever we worship you, hosanna forever we worship you
Hosanna forever, hosanna forever and ever
and ever, hosanna we praise you, hosanna forever and ever and ever.
Hosanna forever  hosanna forever and ever and ever, hosanna forever, hosanna forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever hosanna forever hosanna forever we love you hosanna, we praise you hosanna you're worthy
