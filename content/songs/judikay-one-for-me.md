What is Life not Lived for You
What is Life not Lived in You
Jesus, Jesus my Bridegroom
This Heart is all Yours
This Heart is all Yours
Jesus, Jesus my Lover
This Heart is all Yours
This Heart is all Yours
What is Life not Lived for You
What is Life not Lived in You
Jesus, Jesus my Bridegroom
This Heart is all Yours
This Heart is all Yours
Jesus, Jesus my Lover
This Heart is all Yours
This Heart is all Yours

You are the One for Me
You are the One for Me
You are the One I Hunger for
You are the One I Hunger for
You are the One for Me
You are the One for Me
You are the One I Hunger for
You are the One I Hunger for
I'm just Your Steward
Everything You give to me
I give it Back
It is Your Heart I want Oh
It is You I want to Know
I'm just Your Steward, Jesus
Everything You give to me
I give it Back
It is Your Heart I want Ooh
It is You,
[Bridge]
Intimacy with You
KOINONIA with You
No one Else will do
Nothing Else will Do
Intimacy with You
KOINONIA with You
No one Else will do
Nothing Else will Do
Intimacy with You
KOINONIA with You
No one Else will do
Nothing Else will Do
Intimacy with You
KOINONIA with You
No one Else will do
Ooh Ooh Ooh Oh

You are the One for Me
You are the One for Me
You are the One I Hunger for
You are the One I Hunger for
Forever, Mu Na Gi O, Jesus
You are the One for Me
You are the One I Hunger for
You are the One I Hunger for
[Outro]
I am Unashamedly
In Love with You
Unapologetically in Love with You
You are the One
My Soul Longs for
You are the One
My Heart Truly Beats for
Ooh Jesus, to Bow at Your Feet
Is my Highest Calling
Is my Highest Calling
To Bow at Your Feet
I'm in Love with You Lord
