I sing this praise for you alone
And once again I worship
At your throne
I lift you up you cover me
Safe and strong
Sheltered by your wings
I gaze upon Your glory now
Redeeming love satisfies my soul
You summon angels all around
This joy of salvation I have found
I adore you I will come
With shouts of joy into your presence
Faithful God my heart is overwhelmed by you
In Spirit and in truth I stand
To worship You with all i am
I'm yours, Lord
I am yours, my Lord
Jesus, my heart is overwhelmed
