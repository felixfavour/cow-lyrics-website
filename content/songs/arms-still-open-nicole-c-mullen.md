Losing again, hiding within
Got no more games to play
Hurting inside, my wounded pride
Won't let me run Your way
Though I know
Your heart is made of love
I don't know
What I was thinkin' of
Is it true
I'll never do enough
For You to leave or walk away
Are Your arms still open
Opened to me
Can You hear me cry
Though I know I've hurt You
At times desert You
I have to ask You why
Why are Your arms still open
Opened wide to me
Bitter heartache, vows I break
How can Your heart stay true
Sweet autumn rain, mocking my pain
Washing my grey skies blue
