Your love is ever sure
And in its steadfastness
It has no end
The glory of your reign
And the greatness of your name
It has no end
Great God of love
I know your faithfulness
It has no end
I'll love you every day with this very life you gave
It has no end
Lord, your sheer mercy
Flows to all
Slow to anger
Abounding in love
Not for earthly glory
But for your praise
You created a master piece
You created me
Your love is ever sure
And in its steadfastness
It has no end
The glory of your reign
And the greatness of your name
It has no end
Great God of love
I know your faithfulness
It has no end
I'll love you every day with this very life you gave
It has no end
In all the stories told and heard
None describes the depth of your love
Even up till date, none has puzzled out the vastness of space
All those who have waited
just to see your end
You still loved them to their very end
Your love is ever sure
And in its steadfastness
It has no end
The glory of your reign
And the greatness of your name
It has no end
Great God of love
I know your faithfulness
It has no end
I'll love you every day with this very life you gave
It has no end
There is no other
There is love like yours
Hallelujah
I have seen your love
It has no end
