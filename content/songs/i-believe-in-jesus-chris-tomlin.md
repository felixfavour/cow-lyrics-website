There is a savior for the sinner
He is my friend and my forgiver
There is new mercy that flows like rivers
It washes me, it washes me
I believe in Jesus
He is the Son of God
He died and rose to save my soul
I confess that He is Lord
There is a cross that reminds me
There's only one who is worthy
And there is a grave forever empty
Oh, I bеlieve
Yes, I bеlieve, oh
I believe in Jesus
He is the Son of God
He died and rose to save my soul
I confess that He is Lord
[Bridge]
You are Lord
You are Lord
You are Lord
I confess, You are Lord
My salvation, my reward
You are all I'm living for
You are Lord
You are Lord
I confess, You are Lord
Every knee will bow before
Jesus Christ forevermore
