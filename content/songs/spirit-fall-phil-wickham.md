Lord, we're humbled in Your sight
Shining from above how we need Your light
Guide us in Your grace, guide us home
[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, be all that we can see
We ask for You to come, we are on our knees
Save us by Your grace, lead us home
Spirit fall, hear the voices round
Your children call out to You, we bow down
Heal the broken heart, have mercy on us now
Love is pouring from Your heart
Hope is in Your hands, life is in Your arms
Here in Your embrace we are home
Spirit fall, hear the voices round
Your children call out to You and we bow down
Heal the broken hearts, have mercy on us now
[Bridge]
Spirit fall
Spirit fall
Hear your children call
Spirit fall on us, fall on us now
