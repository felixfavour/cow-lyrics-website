C'mon
And I've scaled all the highest of mountains
And I've stood at the edge of their peaks
But I still couldn't see to the edge of
Your love for me, yeah
And I've walked on the wildest of waters
And I've sunk to the depths of the sea
But I still couldn't fathom the depths of
Your love for me
'Cmon sing this with me, canyons wide
Canyons wide, oceans deep
Can't contain all Your love for me
No matter how high or far I reach
There's no end to Your love for mе
Yeah, I've wrestlеd
And I've wrestled belief in the valley
And I barely hung on through the night
But just when I thought it was darkest the sun began to rise
'Cmon, canyons wide
