What I see can be so depressing
What I hear can be overwhelming
What I'm up against can be so confusing
It leaves war within me
When my heart is overwhelmed
Remind me of what you said in your word
When my heart is overwhelmed
Remind me of what you said in your word
that I walk by faith and not by sight
I walk by faith and not by sight
I walk by faith and not by sight
I walk by faith in Jesus Christ
My hope is built on nothing else
Than Jesus blood and righteousness
I walk by faith and not by sight
I walk by faith in Jesus Christ
What we see can be so depressing
What we hear can be overwhelming
What we are up against can be so challenging
And it leaves war within us
But when your heart is overwhelmed
Remind us of what you said in your word
When my heart is overwhelmed
Remind me of what you said in your word
that I walk by faith and not by sight
I walk by faith and not by sight
I walk by faith and not by sight
I walk by faith in Jesus Christ
My hope is built on nothing else
Than Jesus blood and righteousness
I walk by faith and not by sight
I walk by faith in Jesus Christ
(repeat)
