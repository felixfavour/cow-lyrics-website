We've got nothing to lose
We've got no reason to hide
We've got the answer inside of us
It's time we took our disguises off
See Your glory revealed
See Your Name lifted high
'Cause there is nobody else for us
Jesus, You are the only One
[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa Oh Oh
You're alive and we are free
You are everything, everything we need
There's not a minute to waste
Not a second to lose
Cause there's a city that waits for us
It's time to took all the lamp shades off
See Your glory revealed
See Your Name lifted higher
'Cause there is nobody else for us
Jesus, You are the only One
