All Creatures of Our God and King
All creatures of our God and King
Lift up your voice and with us sing
O praise Him alleluia
Thou burning sun with golden beam
Thou silver moon with softer gleam
O praise Him O praise Him
Alleluia alleluia alleluia
Thou rushing wind that art so strong
Ye clouds that sail in Heav'n along
O praise Him alleluia
Thou rising moon in praise rejoice
Ye lights of evening find a voice
O praise Him O praise Him
Alleluia alleluia alleluia
Let all things their Creator bless
And worship Him in humbleness
O praise Him alleluia
Praise praisе the Father praise thе Son
And praise the Spirit three in One
O praise Him O praise Him
Alleluia alleluia alleluia
