Early Life of John Newton.

John Newton was born on July 24, 1725, in Wapping, London, England. His father was a shipmaster, and Newton went to sea at a young age. He worked on various ships, including slave ships, and eventually became a captain himself.
Involvement in the Slave Trade.
Newton's involvement in the slave trade had a profound impact on his life.
He was part of the transatlantic slave trade, which involved transporting enslaved Africans from West Africa to the Americas. 
Newton's experiences during this time would later influence his writing and his advocacy for abolition.
Spiritual Awakening.
In 1748, Newton's ship was caught in a severe storm off the coast of Ireland.
Newton was forced to confront his own mortality and the reality of his sinful life. This experience marked the beginning of Newton's spiritual awakening.
Conversion and Ordination.
After his spiritual awakening, Newton began to study theology and eventually became an ordained minister in the Church of England. 
He served as a curate in Olney, Buckinghamshire, where he met his friend and fellow hymn writer, William Cowper.
