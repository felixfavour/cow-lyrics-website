You covered me with love
You silenced the shame
You kept your arms wide open
And you never gave up
You waited so patiently
You waited for me
It was hard some days to love myself
Couldn't find the words for what I felt
I was depressed, wounded, helpless
Oh, but then
You called me by name
Beckoned me to come
You gave me living water
You covered me with love
You silenced the shame
You kept your arms wide open
And you never gave up
You waited so patiently
Oh oh
You waited patienly
You waited patienly
And never had a reason to give up on me
You were right there, you were right there, you were right there
Oh never turn, waited for me
Yeah, you didn't gave up on me
So many others gave up on me
But you stood right there, and you waited
You waited
You waited
You waited
You waited
You waited
You waited
You waited
You waited
You waited for me
Hey, when your arms wide open
When your arms wide open
Hey just like a magical song
You crown me before you clean me
You crown me before you clean me
You said I still your child
You waited for me
And you crown me for royalty
You waited for me
Oh I should've gave up
But you never let me gave up
You waited for me
When it's empty around
And you were standing right there
You waited for me
It always for you, I come step through the door for you
You waited for me
You waited for me
You waited for me
You waited for me
You never gave up
You never gave up
You never gave up
You never gave up
You never gave up
You never gave up
You never gave up
You waited so patiently
You're patient boy
You're patient boy
You're not in a hurry
You know my heart form the begining
Teach me who I am
Show me who I am
Show me who I am
Reveal to me who I am
I wanna see me, I can see me
I wanna see me like you see me
I wanna see me through your eyes
You never gave up
You waited so patiently
