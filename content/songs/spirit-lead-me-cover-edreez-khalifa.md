Hook (Hillsong)
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Qake me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior
Verse( edreez khalifa)
Emimimo oya gbami kale
Gbamikale. kode ra mikale
Baba God Mama kpada leyin me
Jeki hustle yiii KO ba mi dale..
The fact is am on is
All  other doors you could think of
Gbogbo eh motikan ah no say na time
When my time comes baba God gimme
So many options kin ba  le mukan
Yomi kuro ninu zero yiii elevate
Mi atleeast kin tie dikan
Moti gunke moti soh kon  kon kon
Gbo gbo  lekkun moti kan......
Family no.dey ready to help
Somebody. Save somebody help
Me no say nobody send
But ah believe in my self
