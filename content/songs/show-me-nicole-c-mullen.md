Show me where You are
Sh-show me where You are
Show me where You are
Sh-show me where You are
It's 9 am again
And I'm still in bed
I cannot seem to shake
The dreams in my head
Last night on my TV
More shocking news
The great confusion of
"Evangelistic Views"
I'm no theologist
But it can't be right
When some have everything
And others not a bite
No time for wondering
Let's make this "pledge"
Inst–µad of holding on
We empty out our hands
How can we tell the world
The things we know about You
When it's so clear to see
We've lost the glimpse of You
I'm starting here and now
To do something about it
Help me see the aching
From Your point of view, oh!
