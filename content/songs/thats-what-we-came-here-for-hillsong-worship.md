We come into Your presence with singing
Come into Your presence with praise
Enter Your gates with thankful hearts
We are going to celebrate
All of heaven?s waiting
Power is on its way
So we shout hallelujah
Lifting to You a mighty roar of praise
You deserve the highest praise
We can give and more
Lord, we give You our praise
That?s what we came here for
You deserve the highest praise
We can give and more
Lord, we give You our praise
That?s what we came here for
We come into Your presence with singing
Come into Your presence with praise
Enter Your gates with thankful hearts
We are going to celebrate
All of heaven?s waiting
Power is on its way
So we shout hallelujah
Lifting to You a mighty roar of praise
