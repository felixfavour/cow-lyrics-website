I remember how You found me, the prayer that I prayed
How You saved me, how You changed me, amazing grace
I'm no longer an orphan, a captive, a fool
It’s good to be loved by You
[Chorus: Cody Carnes]
And how sweet it is to walk with You, Jesus
It is, it's better than life
One thing is certain, I know one thing is true
It's good to be loved by You
You are there at my lowest, when I’m needing a friend
You hear me and You help me again and again
You are nothing but faithful, I've got a lifetime of proof
It's good to be loved by You
[Chorus: Cody Carnes & Natalie Grant]
And how sweet it is to walk with You, Jеsus
It is, it's better than life
Onе thing is certain, I know one thing is true
It's good to be loved by You (By You)
[Interlude: Natalie Grant & Cody Carnes]
So good to be loved by You
Yeah, Nobody like Jesus
Alright, here we go
