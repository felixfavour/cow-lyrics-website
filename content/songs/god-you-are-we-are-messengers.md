When I was young You called my name
I tried to run but still You came
And You stepped into the dark
'Cause that's just the kind of God You are
When Heaven seems beyond my reach
You still see eternity in me
You're turning ashes into art
'Cause that's just the kind of God You are
[Chorus: Darren Mulligan]
It's in the empty tomb, it's on the rugged cross
Your death-defying love is written in Your scars
You'll never quit on me, You'll always hold my heart
'Cause that's the kind of God You are
You gave me freedom from my sin
You told me I could start again
All thе hurt is dead and gone
Now we'rе Your daughters and Your sons
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
We once were lost but now we're found
Forever You hold us in Your arms
'Cause that's just the kind of God You are (Oh)
