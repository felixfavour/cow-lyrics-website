God of ages
Bringing glory here
You are good, You are good
Son of righteousness
You are all I see
With all my heart
PreChorus:
Giver of life
Hope for the lost is in You
All of the earth
Shines with Your light Your glory
Chorus:
You are the God who lives
You are the God who heals
Who are my hope my everything
In Your promise
And Your faithfulness
I will trust all my days
King forever
Great in majesty
Be glorified
