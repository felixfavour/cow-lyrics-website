Jesus all-glorious
Prepare in us your temple
We're called as living stones
Where You're enthroned
And as You rose from death in pow'r
So rise within our worship
Rise upon our praise
And let the hand that saw You raised
Clothe us in Your glory
And draw us by Your grace
O the glory of Your presence
We Your temple give You rev'rence
So arise to Your rest
And be blessed by our praise
As we glory in Your embrace
As Your presence now fills this place
