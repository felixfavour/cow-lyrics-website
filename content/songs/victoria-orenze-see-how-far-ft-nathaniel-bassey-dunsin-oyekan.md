David said
He was so moved by God, and He said: Who am I?
What is my fathers house? That You've brought me this far?
Who am I? A rejected stone, they didn't want me, my brothers sold me,
they didn't believe in my dreams
But God said David, Is my Friend. David "I have loved"
Who am I?
And David could not help but give thanks.
And who am I? Who is my fathers housethat You've brought me this far?
Who are we? Some of us do not even know our names
They don't know our father's name
But they know us, because of Jesus! Because of Jesus! Because of Jesus! Because of Jesus!
I never knew You would favor me this way
I never knew
Jesus
See how far, how much, how well
