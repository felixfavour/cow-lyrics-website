Your Perfect Love
Is Casting out Fear in me
I'm in an Awe
An Awe of your Name
No Guilt in Life
No Fear in death
Is the Power of Christ in me
No Guilt in Life
No Fear in death
Is the Power of Christ in me

I'm Standing of the Solid Rock
His name is Jesus
I'm Standing of the Solid Rock
His name is Jesus
He did not Fail
I Cannot Fail
His name is Jesus
I'm Standing of the Solid Rock
His name is Jesus
Oh, by my God
I Run through a Troop
Oh, by my God
 u00e2¦ u00e2¦ u00e2¦
No Shaking, no Drying
I Stand Unmoved
I Stand Unshakable
I'm not Tired
I'm Rooted on the Solid Rock
No Shaking, no Drying
I Stand Unmoved
Secured in the Fathers Hands
I'm Rooted on the Solid Rock

I'm Standing of the Solid Rock
His name is Jesus
I'm Standing of the Solid Rock
His name is Jesus
He did not Fail
I Cannot Fail
His name is Jesus

I'm Standing of the Solid Rock
His name is Jesus
He did not Fail
