Skies spin their dance within Your breath
Time runs its race within Your hand
And my mind runs wild to comprehend
What no mind on earth could understand
Your ways are higher
Your thoughts are wilder
Love came like madness
Poured out in blood-washed romance
It makes no sense but this is grace
And I know You're with me in this place
[Bridge 1]
Here now
All I know is I know that You are here now
Still my heart
Let Your voice be all I hear now
Spirit breathe like the wind
Come have Your way
'Cause I know You're in this place
Faith makes a fool of what makes sense
But grace found my heart where logic ends
When justice called for all my debts
The friend of sinners came instead
