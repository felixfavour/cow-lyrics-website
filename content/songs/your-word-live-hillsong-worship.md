[Instrumental]
Before the earth knew, its foundations
You spoke the dust, into creation
Until the end, when all has withered
Then still your Word, will endure forever
[Pre-Chorus]
The lamp unto my feet
The light unto my path
Ohhh-ohh-oh
Your Word, will not be shaken
Your Word, will never fail me
Like a fire in my bones
Like a whisper to my soul
Your Word, is revelation
[Interlude]
Deep calls to deep, within Your presence
When I hear You speak, my soul awakens
Your Spirit leads, my heart to worship
As Your Word reveals, the light of Jesus
