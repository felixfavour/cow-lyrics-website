It should have been my brow
That bore the crown of thorns
It should have been my back
That carried up that cross
[Chorus: Victory Boyd & Jimi Cravity]
I couldn't thank you more
You didn't just die for
But as me, as me
You died and rose again as me
You stood in my place
I'm a miracle of grace
And I'm free as me
It should have been my scars
That paid for all my sin
It should have been my name
That marked Your stone and grave
[Chorus: Victory Boyd & Jimi Cravity]
And I, I couldn't thank you more
You didn't just die for me
But as me, as me
You died and rose again as me
You stood in my place
I'm a miracle of grace
And I'm free as me, as me
