I would like to walk this world with you always
Never want to be apart from You oh Lord
I am sometimes overwhelmed by truth of Your ways
Could it be that I was made for You along the way
I am falling
I am falling in love
I am falling in love
I am falling in love with You
I am falling
I am falling in love
I am falling in love
I am falling in love with You
Would you stay and listen for a while
Please stay
And let me talk of how You make me smile
I would like to leave it all behind
My ways
But I get caught up in myself sometimes
All I can say
