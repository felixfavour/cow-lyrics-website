We're heaven-spun creations
His pride and adoration
Treasures woven by His love
His careful hands they hold us
Safe within His promise
Of calling and of destiny
We're heaven-spun creations
His pride and adoration
Treasures woven by his love
His careful hands they hold us
Safe within His promise
Of calling and of destiny
And I will sing of all You've done
And I'll remember how far You've carried me
From beginning until the end
You are faithful, faithful to the end
A Father's heart that's for me
A never-ending story
Of love that's always chasing me
His kindness overwhelming
And hope for me unending
He's never given up on me (Oh)
