Spirit sound, rushing wind
Fire of God fall within
Holy Ghost breathe on us we pray
As we repent, turn from sin
Revival embers smouldering
Breath of God, fan us into flame
[Chorus: TAYA]
We need a fresh wind
The fragrance of Heaven
Pour Your Spirit out
Pour Your Spirit out
For hearts that burn with holy fear
Purified in faith and deed
Refiner's fire strengthen what remains
So we the church who bear Your light
Lamp aflame, city bright
King and kingdom come is what we pray
