Walls are comin' down
Fear is comin' down
Lies are comin' down
By the blood of the Lamb
Idols are comin' down
Giants are comin' down
Darkness is comin' down
By the blood of the Lamb
No weapon formed against me can stand against Your Word
Shout it out, every stronghold must come down
Jesus is undefeated, the battle is the Lord's
Shout it out, every stronghold must come down
Mountains are comin' down
Addictions are comin' down
And all evil is comin' down
By the blood of the Lamb, the blood of the Lamb, yeah
No weapon formed against me can stand against Your Word
Shout it out, every stronghold must come down
Jesus is undefeated, the battle is the Lord's
Shout it out, every stronghold must come down
