.. *2
uh uh uh uh uh uh uh.....
Where would I've run to
Who would I've run to
If not for you...*2
You took away the pain
And made exchange for gain oh
You're my burden bearer
My burden bearer
When the people pointed at me
You didn't let go
Your mercy say no
When I came back, running to you
You never let me down
Cause you've always gat my back
Chorus
Idi ebube*2
Ibu dike na dimpa
Dike na dimpa
Idi ebube*2
Ibi dike na dimpa
Dike na dimpa
Harmony

Idi ebube*2
Ibu dike na dimpa
Dike na dimpa
Idi ebube*2
Ibu dike na dimpa

When they laughed at me
You made me laughed back
I never lost my praise
Because you're the lifter of my heads....
Oloriye loriye loreyi
Onye ne mema
Aka na gboria
Oturu fere mmanu ee.....
Ooo......
oh oh oh....
Oh oh oh.....
Oh oh oh.....
When they laughed at me
You made me laughed back
I never lost my praise
Because you're the lifter of my heads
Even if they will still laughed at me again
I know that you will make me laughed back.
Cause I never lose my praise
Because you're the lifter of my heads.....
Hallelujah.
