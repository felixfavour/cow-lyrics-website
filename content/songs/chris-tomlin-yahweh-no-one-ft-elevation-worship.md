Yahweh, Yahweh
Holy is Your name
I don't want to take it in vain
Yahweh, Yahweh
Holy is Your name
I don't want to take it in vain
There will be no other God before You
There will be no other God before You
There is no one above You
No one beside You
And nobody like You
There will be no other God before You
No One, No One, No One
No One, No One, No One
Yahweh, Yahweh
Holy is Your name
I don't want to take it in vain
Yahweh, Yahweh
Holy is Your name
I don't want to take it in vain
There will be no other God before You
There will be no other God before You
There is no one above You
No one beside You
And nobody like You
There will be no other God before You
No One, No One, No One
No One, No One, No One
Who else can lead us, lead us to freedom
No One, No One, No One
Who else can heal all our sins and diseases
No One, No One, No One
Who else can walk, walk on the water
No One, No One, No One
And who else can answer, answer by fire
No One, No One, No One
And who else can bring down the tallest of giants
No One, No One, No One
And who else can silence the roar of the lion
No One, No One, No One
And who else is worthy, worthy of worship
No One, No One, No One
And who else is worthy, worthy of worship
There will be no other God before You
There will be no other God before You
There is no one above You
No one beside You
And nobody like You
There will be no other God before You
There is no one above You
No one beside You
And nobody like You
There will be no other God before You
There is no one above You
No one beside You
And nobody like You
There will be no other God before You
No One, No One, No One
Nobody greater, Nobody higher
No One, No One, No One
Nobody greater, Nobody higher
No One, No One, No One
Nobody greater, Nobody higher
No One, No One, No One
Nobody greater, Nobody higher
No One, No One, No One
