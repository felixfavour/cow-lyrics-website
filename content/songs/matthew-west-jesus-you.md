When the miles are too high for counting
And the hills too steep to climb
When the world outside ain't making sense
And the truth's too lost to find
When the lines too blurred for seeing
And my wrongs too wrong to right
When I'm hanging by that final thread
And my strongs too weak to fight
I hear a song sweet song singing to my soul
I see a light house in a hurricane and it's leading me back home
When I think about the only things in life that pull me through
I hit my knees and thank the lord for Jesus and you
Oh yes I do oohhh everyday I do
One is saving me for heaven
When I leave this world behind
And one gives me just a little taste
When she holds me late at night
The both give grace and it's amazing
They both have healing in their hands
And it ain't easy but they're both making me a better man
And I hear a song sweet song singing to my soul
I see a light house in a hurricane and it's leading me back home
When I think about the only things in life that pull me through
I hit my knees and thank the lord for Jesus and you
Everyday I do oooh
Yeah yeah yeah
Everyday I do yeah
You've got a ring around your finger
While he had scars on his hand
Why you both promised me forever
God I'll never understand
When I think about the only things in life that pull me through
I hit my knees and thank the lord for Jesus and you
I hit my knees and thank the lord for Jesus Jesus and you
Everyday I do everyday I do yeah
So when I think about the only things in life that pull me through
I hit my knees and thank the lord for Jesus and you
Oh I hit my knees and thank the lord for Jesus and you
