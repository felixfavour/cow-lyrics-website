Can anybody hear me?
Is there anyone who can help me?
Can someone feel the pain I'm going through?
My eyes are red from crying
And my world is slowly dying
And I'm standing lost, not knowing what to do
[Pre-Chorus]
Can someone explain
The purpose for the pain?
When is my praying done?
Tell me when this overcome
I'll give it one last try
Savior, can You save me?
See my faith, I've let it go
Change me and make me
Better than I was before
I didn't mean to break Your heart
Jesus, I apologize
Fear covered up my mind
So I didn't realize love was there all the time
Can anybody hear me?
Is there anyone who can help me?
Can I go back and start life over again?
I wouldn't give my heart so easy
I would dance and laugh more freely
I'd try harder knowing that failing's not the end
