I cannot take credit for these things
This crown you gave to me I lay it down
You're the force behind me
You are my voice, You are carrying me
That is why I've come to say
All I've come to offer
Imela oh
That is all I've come to say
All I've come to offer
Imela oh
Imela oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Imela oh
Imela oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Imela oh
That is all I've come to say
That is all I've come to offer
Imela oh
That is all I've come to say
That is all I've come to offer
Imela oh
Hey are You grateful
Me I am grateful
Hey me I am thankful Jesus oh
I am Your teddybear forever
All I've come to say
All I've come to offer
All I've come to say
All I've come to offer
It's not the eloquence
It's beyond the hardwork
It's beyond intelligence
But the all sovereign God qualifies those he calls
So that we can say of Him and that we can declare of Him
I am all I am
But by His grace
And by His mercies
And by His mercies
That is hy I've come to say
All I've come to offer
(Imela oh)
Hey thank You Jesus, thank You Jesus
Imela Imela papa o
I say I am truly truly grateful Jesus
Oh my God
I compel my being to give thanks
For by my God I run through troops
You are my God and I give You praise
Imela ya ya ya ya ya hey
Blessed be the God of my salvation
I compel my mind to remember
I will not forget how You changed my life
How You lifted me
I judge You faithful
You are the summary of my life
My Jesus
I don't need a reason to be here
You are my reason
So take Your glory, take Your praise, take the honor
(Imela Imela)
Thank You, thank You
Thank You for the closed doors and the open doors
The times You said Yes
The times You said No
Thank You my God
It is cause of You I count losses as gains
It is Your hand
It is Your favor
It is Your grace
It is Your goodness
It is Your mercies
It is Youuuuu
That is why I've come to say
All I've come to offer
Thank You
That is all I've come to really say
All I've come to offer - Imela o
