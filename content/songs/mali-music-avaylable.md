So many time in my life
(life)
Have I tried to do it all by myself
(self)
But after numerous failures I realized
(lized)
That the glory is due to God and no one else
(else)
I was runnin to and fro tryna make things happen
(slow down)
That's what I'd hear Him say but it ain't until something bad happens
(that turned my life upside down)
Or will I give up Jesus
(Jesus)
It's all in your hands now Father
(Father)
Do what you will with me, have your way
(have your way)
Lord please keep me in your will
Lord help me to be still
I just wanna be avaylable to you
(yeah)
I will do whatever you
You instruct me to do
I just wanna be avaylable to you
(yeah)
Not once, not twice, not three times
(times)
Have I dropped the ball when it was on the line
(line)
But please believe the last time was the last time
(time)
Cuz I'm gonna let your will be done and not mine
(not mine)
Things have gotten better, the sun's a little brighter
(brighter)
And since I cast my cares on you I'll feel a little lighter
(lighter)
Now I can hold my head high, stick my chest out
(out)
Because your will will surely be carried out
(no doubt about it)
Lord please keep me in your will
Lord help me to be still
I just wanna be avaylable to you
(yeah)
I will do whatever you
You instruct me to do
I just wanna be avaylable to you
(yeah)
I won't move, I'll wait
(I'll sit here and I'll wait)
Until you show me the way
(lead me in the right direction)
The safest place
(it's in the will of God)
Patiently I'll wait
(Jesus)
Lord please keep me in your will
Lord help me to be still
I just wanna be avaylable to you
(yeah)
I will do whatever you
You instruct me to do
I just wanna be avaylable to you
(yeah)

Lord
