On Christ alone
Our Chief Cornerstone
No other foundation
Can we build upon
Not philosophy
Nor the wisdom of man
All other ground
Is sinking sand
Upon this Rock
You build Your Church
And the gates of hell
Will not prevail
When we bind and loose
We proclaim Your truth
And in Jesus' Name,
We will not fail
Never fail
Whoa
Crucified
Raised up from the dead
Led captivity captive
It is finished
He gave us the keys
His authority
Now we are joint-heirs
To the praise of His glory
Glory
Upon this Rock
You build Your Church
And the gates of hell
Will not prevail
When we bind and loose
We proclaim Your truth
And in Jesus' Name,
We will not fail
Will never fail
No we will never fail
We will never fail
No we will never fail
We will never fail we will never fail
No no
