Stanza 1:
With every step I take and every move I make my consciousness and all of my consciousness and you and I'll be there to second guess no utter regret and I'm fully,I'm fully sold out to you.
Chorus: And my hope, my hope is in you alone and if you look me well is written all over me(aiii) can't fold my arms they are wide open(wide open) for your embrace and I can not stress it enough.
You have no rival,none is your equal and I can't make no sense of any if you ain't here
Oyo mi Oyo mi ooo
Oto mi Oyo mi ooo
you complete me
you're more than enough for me
You have no rival,none is your equal and I can't make no sense of any if you ain't here
Oyo mi Oyo mi ooo
Oto mi Oyo mi ooo
you complete me.
you're more than enough for me.
