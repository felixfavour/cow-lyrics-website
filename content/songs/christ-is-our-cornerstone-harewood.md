Christ is our cornerstone;
On him alone we build;
With his true saints above
The courts of Heav'n are filled:
On His great love
Our hopes we place
Of present grace
And joys above.
2. Oh, then, with hymns of praise
These hallowed courts shall ring!
Our voices we will raise,
The Three in One to sing;
And thus proclaim
In joyful song,
Both loud and long,
That glorious name.
3. Here, gracious God, we pray,
Forevermore draw nigh;
Accept each faithful pray'r,
And mark each humble sigh:
In copious stores,
On all who pray,
Each holy day,
Your blessings pour.
4. Here may we gain from Heav’n
The grace we now implore,
And may that grace, once giv’n,
Be with us evermore.
Until that day
When all the blest
In endless rest
Are called away.
5. Praise to the God of Heav’n,
Praise to his holy Son,
And praise to him be giv’n
Who joins them both in One:
The Holy Dove,
Who gives us grace
To find our place
With God above.
