Everyone needs compassion,
the love thats never failing,
let mercy fall on me,
Everyone needs forgiveness,
the kindness of a saviour,
the hope of nations,
ooh.
chorus.
Saviour He can move the mountains,
my God is mighty to save,
He is mighty to save,
forever author of salvation,
He rose and conquered the grave,
Jesus conquered the grave.
So take me as you find me,
all my fears and failures,
fill my life again,
I give my life to follow,
everything I believe in,
now I surrender.
chorus.
Saviour He can move the mountains,
my God is mighty to save,
He is mighty to save,
forever author of salvation,
He rose and conquered the grave,
Jesus conquered the grave.
