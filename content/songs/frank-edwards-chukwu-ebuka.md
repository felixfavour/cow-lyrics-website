I woke up one early morning
I said a prayer
And I read my bible
As I was on my way to work
I saw a crowd
And they were shouting
They were looking at a dead man
Didn't know what to do
Then I move close to the dead man
And I raised my hands in prayer
As I lift my voice to God
Hallelujah he's alive today
Jehovah emeworom ihe o Jiri buru Chi O
Jehovah emewo iye eh
Jehovah emeworom ihe O Jiri buru Chi O
Jehovah emewo mma
Jehovah emeworom ihe o Jiri buru Chi O
Jehovah emewo iye eh
Jehovah emeworom ihe O Jiri buru Chi O
Jehovah emewo mma
