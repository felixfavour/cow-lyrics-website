Foursquare we stand for the living word
For the word of God
Telling to all the story of Jesus, stem of Jesse’s rod
Man of sorrow and of grief, dying on the tree
Mighty Redeemer, glorious Saviour
Jesus of Calvary

Preach the Foursquare Gospel
The Foursquare Gospel
Clear let the Foursquare message ring
(Let it ring)
Jesus only Saviour, Baptizer and Healer
Jesus the coming King

Unfurl your banners and forward go
Oh ye ransomed host
Trusting in Jesus Mighty Baptizer
With the Holy Ghost
Lion of Judah, King of kings, Lord of lords is He
Clothing HIs church with power to witness
Leading to victory

Catch up your shield oh ye living Church
Christ of Galilee
Bore all our sickness, carried our sorrows
Set the prisoners free
Lift the fallen, help the faith, dry the weeping eyes
Come bring your sickness
to thy physician, for He is passing by.

Lift your eyes, then unto the hills
Lift your voice and sing
The cloud of heavens aflame with glory
greet the coming king
Swift as wings of eagle’s flight
shall He come again
