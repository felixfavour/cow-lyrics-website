Why are we weighed down
Can we see no solution,
Why don't we look up
To the hope of our salvation
Can you see, that our God is faithful
Yesterday, today forever
Let every tribe and every tongue
Come to the Son who's born
Those who call on Him
He has promised to save
Come let us praise,
Lift up your eyes,
To the Lord
Lift up your eyes, lift up your voice
Lift up your heart
For in His love we can rejoice
Can you see, that our God is faithful
Yesterday, today forever
Let every tribe and every tongue
Come to the Son who's born
Those who call on Him
He has promised to save
Come let us praise
Lift up your eyes
To the Lord
Lift up your eyes, lift up your voice
Lift up your heart
For in His love we can rejoice
