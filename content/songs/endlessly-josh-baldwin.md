It's already been done, You can't add to His blood
It was once for all the Father gave his Son
Forever we are changed by the miracle of grace
Throughout history the Father's light remains
Praises rise endlessly
We lay our lives before the King
Who was and who is
His love will always be
The hope for all eternity
We've only just begun to see all of heaven come
Every fear will bow at the Father's perfect love
Your kingdom is at hand, the gates of hell won't stand
Now in victory we lift our song again
Praises rise endlessly
We lay our lives before the King
Who was and who is
His love will always be
The hope for all eternity
