I'm looking at a masterpiece
I'm staring at a work of art
I'm listening to a symphony
In every beat of your tiny heart
You used to be a choice to make
But now I think you've chosen me
'Cause I see ten fingers, ten toes
Two eyes and I know this is meant to be
Oh I don't believe in accidents
Miracles, they don't just happen by chance
As long as my God holds the world in His hands
I know that there's no such thing as unplanned
Broken turns to beautiful
I see you right before my eyes
And every single breath you breathe
Is destiny love has brought to life
I thought it was my story's end
But now the future's all I see
Instead of asking who you might've been
I'm wondering who you're gonna be
'Cause I don't believe in accidents
Miracles, they don't just happen by chance
As long as my God holds the world in His hands
I know that there's no such thing as unplanned
[Psalm 139:14-16:]
I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made
My frame was not hidden from you
When I was made in the secret place,
When I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
Your eyes saw my unformed body;
All the days ordained for me were written in your book
Before one of them came to be.
Every life deserves a voice
Every child deserves a chance
You are more than just a choice
There's no such thing as unplanned
Every life deserves a voice
Every child deserves a chance
You are more than just a choice
There's no such thing as unplanned
Every life deserves a voice
Every child deserves a chance
You are more than just a choice
'Cause there's no such thing as unplanned
