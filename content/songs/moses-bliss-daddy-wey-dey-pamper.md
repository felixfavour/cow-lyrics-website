You, you're re Alpha and omega

Not even May weather
Lord Jesus
On the cross of calvary you nor fall our hands
Because your mind dey
You dey burst our brain on a daily base
But na your head Naim d blood come out from
God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob
You made all things beautiful in your time with no makeup
You collect those things that be not
As though they were
Na so you take tell Lazarus to wake up
I nor come here to come Caparisone because this one nor be bobo
You say cast your bread upon the living waters
And when I do so when I come see am na jumbo
But sometimes we dey loose guard Like lord Lugard
But u still dey surprise Ronaldo how u take dey show us Mercy
Because the path of the Just is like a shinning light
That shines brighter and brighter unto a perfect day
We always step into prepared blessings
If God put u on, No man fit switch u off
So Who art thou o great mountain
Wetin dey worry you
Who you be where God dey
God is more real, more real than madrid
I say God is more real, more real than than Madrid
If God hand dey your on top ur matter
Be rest assured say you go occupy space
Baba we nor come here to do anything
We're just grateful
We're grateful for amazing grace
Can we sing it together (say)
Even when I fall ur hand

You u fully load me with benefits
Everyday of my life I dey collect back to back wotowoto
I stand amazed in your presence
Knowing that you can do far beyond what I can think nor imagine
Amazing God you always come thru for me
You're my refuge and my fortress
Without you this life is worthless, God of the hills and the valleys
God of the Men and the papis, I say God of the hills and the valleys
God of the Men and the papis
All sufficiency, With you there's no emergency
I say with you there's no emergency
You forgive my sins and grant me amnesty
You, u forgive my sins and grant me amnesty
Na you, na you run am for me
You're a father and a friend, I call you my own bestie
I say you're a father and a friend, I call you my own bestie
Papa nor be lie I come lie for this platform

This life nor go make sense without you honestly
Na you dey pamper

When dem put bolt dey waka dey go
U know say for u to catch up
U no need to put bolt u waka on top water
When dem don put bolt dey merchandise
You u know say you for you to sail thru
You no need to book bolt
You waka on top water and you catch up
Who reach u, heaven and earth dey adore you
Men dey bow before u, the 24 elders when dem bow na glory naim dem dey talk
Bcos dem dey see different versions of u
See different versions of your doings
Me I for nor dey this platform dey talk like this
If nor be you when dey pamper
If nor be you when dey show mercy, if nor be you when dey show love
If nor be you wey dey front movement for me
If nor be you wey dey carry me
If nor be you when dey anchor me
If nor be you when dey open doors for me
If nor be you dey speak on my behalf when men dey back bite me
You be everything wey I get
Say out of my belly shall flow rivers of living water like Niger delta
Since I know you, I nor dey run kitikiti, I nor dey run katakata
I nor dey run helter skelter
You're my refuge and fortress, na you be my perfect shelter
Who reach you for this constituency
You're called the monarch of the universe
That is why you're not a local government chairman
Monarch of the universe naim dem dey call you
That is why you're not a local government chairman
You pick us from the miry clay, Set us high above the stage
When Men say there's a casting down
We nor need to gym to say there's a lifting up
When Men say there's a casting down
We, we nor need to gym to say there's a lifting up
God of capital, God of hallelujah, God of wonders
My men from South South call u osalugbua
Some of them look life finish call you Tamuno
Some say u be eledumare
Some from the east say Chineke bi nighwe
Some dey call you ikukuoma nonya
Hausa man look you call you Sariki Salama
Na u be Sariki Salama
Mai nayi daka soni haka
Wetin I do wen be say u love me like this
If nor be for you popsi me I nor know where me for dey
My aim for this life na to project you, because you deserve to be known
Dem nor know how Sleepless nights jam us but u came thru for us
You became our intro, You became our spokeman
You became the one
This life for nor really make sense without u senior
Senior u sent your only begotten son make e come, make e come anchor for us
Lord Jesus me I can't take your place
Your place na your place
Everything wen man be na God naim make am
I say Anything wen man be na God make am
Men dey travel go Dubai just to go seek for pleasure
But you there's no where to go
