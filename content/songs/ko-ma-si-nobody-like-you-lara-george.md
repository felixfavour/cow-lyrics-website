Ko ma si
Ko ma si o
Ko ma si eni ti o dabi re Oba mi o
Iberu ko si, ko si fun mi o
Nitori iwo nikan soso l'oba mi, l'ojo gbogbo
There's nobody like you Lord
There's nobody like our God
There's nobody like You Lord
Like You Lord, like our God
Igbati, igbati o
Igbati omije ba n bo o, mo mo â€˜pe iwo l'abo o
Iberu ko si, ko si fun mi o
Nitori iwo nikan soso l'oba mi
L'ojo gbogobo
When i searched the highest mountains
Looked for you in deepest valley
Searched the rivers small and shallow
Deep and wide o, broad and narrow
I realized there is no one like you
In the earth and in the skies too
Ko ma si, ko si no-one like you
Nobody, nobody o
There's nobody like you Lord
There's nobody like our God
There's nobody like You Lord
Like You Lord, like our God
