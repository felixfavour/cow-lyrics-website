I am the Lord, your God
I go before you now
I stand beside you, I'm all around you
Though you feel I'm far away
I'm closer than your breath
I am with you wherever you go
I am the Lord, your Peace
No evil will conquer you
Steady now your heart and mind
Come into My rest
Oh, let your faith arise
Lift up your weary head
I am with you
Wherever you go
So come to Me, 'cause I'm all you need
Come to Me, I'm everything
Come to Me, I'm all you need
Come to Me, I'm your everything
I am your anchor, in the wind and the waves
And I am your steadfast, so don't be afraid
If your heart and flesh fail you
I'm your faithful strength
And I am with you
Wherever you go
