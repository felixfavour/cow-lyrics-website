Are you hurting and broken within?
Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin?
Jesus is calling
Have you come to the end of yourself?
Do you thirst for a drink from the well?
Jesus is calling
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
Leave behind your regrets and mistakes
Come today, there's no reason to wait
Jesus is calling
Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy
From the ashes, a new life is born
Jesus is calling (Oh-oh)
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
O come to the altar
The Father's arms are open wide
Forgiveness was bought with
The precious blood of Jesus Christ
