Send down the Spirit of love
Send down the Spirit from above
Let your power flow on each and everyone
Let the Holy Ghost full of compassion come
So we might know that you're here
So we might know that you are real
Send down the Spirit of love
Send down the Spirit from above
Let your power flow on each and everyone
Let the Holy Ghost full of compassion come So they might see that you are here
So they might know that you are real
Send down the Spirit of the Lord
To fill us with the knowledge of His word
Let your anointing fall to break down every yoke
And let the Spirit come confirming my every word
So the world might know that you're here
So the world might know that you are real
So the world might know that you're here
So the world might know that you are real
Send down the glory from the Lord
Fill us with the presence of your love
Let your anointing come, to set the captives free
And let the wonder and the glory
Reveal to us today
Be to the glory of your name
Be to the glory of the Lord
Be to the glory of your name
Be to the glory of the Lord
