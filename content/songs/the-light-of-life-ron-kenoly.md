As darkness awaits the dawn
Morning awaits creation's song
And with the rising sun
Hope comes alive to carry on
The Light of Life
Is shining on
The dark of night
Can't overcome
The Light of Life
That burns so bright
Can take the wrong
And make it right
Everyday people pray
They'll find the strength
To make it through
While there is One who waits
To fill their hearts
With life anew
The Light of Life
Is shining on
The dark of night
Can't overcome
The Light of Life
That burns so bright
Can touch the blind
And give them sight
