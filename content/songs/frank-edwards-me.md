Time is running out right now,
The ones who believed seemed like they don't believe no more,
The world is breaking up right now, people  of the World crying out saying where do we go,
brothers killing brothers
nations fighting nations,
the one who used to call Your name are calling other names;
But as for me, me and my house, we will worship you Jehovah till the end,
talk about
Chorus: Me, Me, Me
    I just want to love you more
    with my spirit and my soul
    I just want to bless your name
lead:.     oh Me, Me, Me @ all ; I just want to love you more with my spirit and my soul, I just want to bless your name.
Call & response :
Your name is holy
Your name is Jesus
You're the answer for the World today
You answer prayers
You rule in every nation
You reign in me and the light of the World
Wherever you send me I will go
You're the pilot of my life
I'll never let you go
Am sold out to you and
it doesn't matter what men say
as for ME, I will worship You.
Chorus: As above
 Chorus repeated thrice
Chorus without beat thrice.
I just want to Bless Your Name 3x.....
