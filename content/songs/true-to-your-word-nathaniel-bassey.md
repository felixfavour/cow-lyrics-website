You are true to Your word
When You speak, it is done
Faithful one, I am that I am
We can rest and be sure
That You won't disappoint
And fulfill all You promised
And You are able to do
Much more than we ask in Your name
It may tarry for a while
And appear to delay
The promises He made to you
Oh, but in the fullness of time
Like a seed from the ground
That breaks through to the sunlight
In beauty and grace
God's word is unfailing, and it's true
Roses may wither, but Your word never fades
My hope is anchored on Jesus, the rock
Jеsus the rock
We can rest and bе sure
That You won't disappoint
And fulfill all You've promised
You will fulfill all You've promised
