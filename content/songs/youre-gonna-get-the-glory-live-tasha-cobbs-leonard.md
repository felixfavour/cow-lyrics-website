[Intro]
Woah, come on clap your hands
Oh, God's gonna get the glory
I've walked through blazing fires
I've sailed the roughest seas
Lived to tell you it was worth it
'Cause You're gonna get the glory
Seen battles by the thousands
Seen both loss and victories
In the end I know what matters
'Cause You're gonna get the glory
And I'm not moved by what I see
Your hand is moving
I know You're using this
I'll live to sing Your victory
'Cause You're gonna get the glory
You're gonna get the glory out of this
[Interlude]
Oh, put your hands on it like that
Oh, yes You will
Let's worship together
