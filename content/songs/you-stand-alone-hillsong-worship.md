I will lay me down at Your feet in worship
And listen to the sweetest sound of all
Oh, God, You are my God
How my heart it longs for You
I'm thirsty for Your presence in my world
[Pre-Chorus]
I cry out night and day for more
To hold the majesty in You
My God, You stand alone
And I worship at Your throne
I will look to see Your power and glory
Jesus, Lord of all
Jesus, Lord of all
I will lay me down at Your feet in worship
And listen to the sweetest sound of all
Oh, God, You are my God
How my heart it longs for You
I'm thirsty for Your presence in my world
[Pre-Chorus]
I cry out night and day for more
To hold the majesty in You
