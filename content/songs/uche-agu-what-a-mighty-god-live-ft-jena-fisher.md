My ears have heard
My eyes have seen the majesty of God
All nations come and see the beauty of our King
I've tasted and seen that He is good
And I've received His love
Before I even knew about myself
His grace met me
God of Heaven
God of the Earth
All creation will sing
That you are Faithful
You are Holy
Every heart will declare
What a Mighty God we serve
What a Mighty God we serve
What a Mighty God we serve
What a Mighty God you've been
You are our God
Mighty, Mighty
Holy, Holy
Mighty God You Are
Awesome Power
Living Savior
You're the God of All
yes, you are.
yes, you've been
