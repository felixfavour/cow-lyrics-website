Every tear Your children cry
Every cloud and stormy sky
Everyone beat up by life
You make beautiful
Every valley I walk through
Every battle I may lose
Days when I give up on You
You make beautiful
[Pre-Chorus: The Walls Group]
See all things together
Are working forever
A beautiful plan for me
[Chorus: The Walls Group]
So make me beautiful
Make over my soul
Till the whole world knows
You make everything beautiful
Everybody waits for You
And we set the stage for You
Now we pray that You come through
And make us beautiful
Change every part of me
Parts that only You can see
In You is where I want to be
So I'll be beautiful
