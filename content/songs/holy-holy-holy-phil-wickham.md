Lightning breaks around Your throne
Streams of glory bursting from Your robe
You are the God in Heaven
[Pre-Chorus]
Voices sing Your endless praise
All who see You bow for countless days
You are the God in Heaven
Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord, God Almighty
Worthy, Worthy, Worthy is the Lamb
The only one who was and is and will come
Fire burns inside Your eyes
Unseen colors circle in the skies
You are the God in Heaven
[Pre-Chorus]
Everything Your hand has saved
Gathers here to sing Your endless praise
You are the God in Heaven
Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord, God Almighty
Worthy, Worthy, Worthy is the Lamb, the King of glory
Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord, God Almighty
Worthy, Worthy, Worthy is the Lamb
The only one who was and is and will come
Who was and is and will come to us
