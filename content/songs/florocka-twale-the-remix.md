Verily verily You are good
Verily verily You are good
Somebody shout alleluia
Alleluia Alleluia Amen
Somebody sing alleluia

Kabiesi Olu orun,
I have come to give You twale (to give You twale)
To give You worship (To give You worship)
Kabiesi Olu orun,
I have come to give You twale (to give You twale)
To give You worship (to give You worship)
If I was a little child,
I will sing and shout for joy
If I was a stallion o,
I will use my force power
If I was a shining star,
I would illuminate everywhere
And If I was the son of a gomina,
I will make everybody trowei salute o
And if I could control the times
I would go back to the garden of Eden
I will give You the worship that only You, You alone deserve
I will look for beautiful names like  Aladewura  o
And I will go on sohun and patewo iye gboruko Re ga
Kabiesi Eleda mi o,
I have come to give You twale (to give You twale)
Yes To give You the worship (To give You
worship)
Kabiesi Olu orun,
I was born to give You twale (to give You twale)
To teriba before You (to give You worship)
No other god compares to You
We Your children were born to wole niwaju E o
(to give You twale)
And give You worship (To give You worship)
E bami damuso fun Oba airi o
E rababa f'Oba ogo (to give You twale)
...(To give You worship)
Only a fool will look into the heavens and say
(there is no God)
Only a mad man will look into the sea (and say
that the fishes are a mistake)
Even the so-called babalawos can testify (that
there is only one Jehovah o)
So who are you to tell me that my Yahweh that's
in heaven doesn't exist
He's a consuming fire o
Yes He is the Lion of the tribe of Judah
Him alone, will I serve You for the rest of my days
Lord I wanna give You twale (to give You twale)
I wanna worship You Jesus (to give You worship)
Lover of my soul, I've come to testify
To give You praise and adoration Oh God (to give
You twale)
Oh all I wanna do is worship (to give You
worship)
Oh Kabiesi Olu-orun o, I've come to throway salute
(to give You twale)
You alone will I give all of the praise,
Jehovah!!!!
Verily verily You are good
Verily verily You are good
Verily verily You are good
Verily verily You are good
Alleluia
