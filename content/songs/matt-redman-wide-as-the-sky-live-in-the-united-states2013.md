Hands up, hearts open, wide as the sky
We lift You high, we lift You high
Hands up, hearts open, wide as we cry
God, we lift Your name high
Hands up, hearts open, wide as the sky
We lift You high, we lift You high
Hands up, hearts open, wide as we cry
God, we lift Your name high

Let all the other names fade away
Let all the other names fade away
Until there's only You
Let all the other names fade away
Jesus, take Your place
Jesus, take Your place
Let all the other names fade away
Let all the other names fade away
Until there's only You
Let all the other names fade away
Jesus, take Your place
Jesus, take Your place

Hands up, hearts open, wide as the sky
We lift You high, we lift You high
Hands up, hearts open, wide as we cry
God, we lift Your name high
Hands up, hearts open, wide as the sky
We lift You high, we lift You high
Hands up, hearts open, wide as we cry
God, we lift Your name high
[Bridge]
Our God, we lift You high, we lift You high
Hands up, God, we lift Your name high
Our God, we lift You high, we lift You high
Hands up, God, we lift Your name high
Our God, we lift You high, we lift You high
Hands up, God, we lift Your name high
Our God, we lift You high, we lift You high
Hands up, God, we lift Your name high!

Let all the other names fade away
Let all the other names fade away
Until there's only You
Let all the other names fade away
Jesus, take Your place
Jesus, take Your place
Let all the other names fade away
Let all the other names fade away
Until there's only You
Let all the other names fade away
Jesus, take Your place
Jesus, take Your place
