Let my heart be a sanctuary
Let my mouth be filled with praise
Let our songs be never-ending
Let our lives exalt Your name
We were created in Your image
Made in the likeness of who You are
We're joined with the angels and all of creation
Singing as one to praise You, God
So let my heart be a sanctuary
Let my mouth be filled with praise
Let our songs be never-ending
Let our lives exalt Your name!
Let my heart be a sanctuary
Let my mouth be filled with praise
Let our songs be never-ending
Let our lives exalt Your name
[Post-Chorus]
I want to be clean inside
Clean for You, Lord
Yes, God!
