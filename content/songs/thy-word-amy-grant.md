Thy Word
Is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path
Thy Word
Is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path
When I feel afraid
Think I've lost my way
Still You're there
Right beside me
Nothing will I fear
As long as You are near
Please be near me to the end
Thy Word
Is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path
Thy Word
Is a lamp unto my feet
And a light unto my path
I will not forget
Your love for me and yet
My heart forever is wandering
