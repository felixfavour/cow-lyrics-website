Great are You, Lord
Mighty in strength
You are faithful
And You will ever be
We will praise You
All of our days
It's for Your glory
We offer everything
Raise your hands all you nations
Shout to God, all creation
How awesome is the Lord most high
Where You send us
God, we will go
You're the answer
We want the world to know
We will trust You
When You call our name
Where You lead us
We'll follow all the way
Raise your hands all you nations
Shout to God, all creation
How awesome is the Lord most high
