They called me out upon the waters
The great unknown what fear may fail
And there I find you in the mysteries in oceans deep my faith will stand
(so we call)
so I will call upon your name
and keep my eyes above the waves
    when oceans rise
My soul will rest in your embrace
     for
       I am yours, and you are mine
your grace and boundaries is in deepest waters
your suffering hymn,
 ooh be my guide
where fear may fail and fear surround's me you never fail
      (come on )
you never fail and you won't start now
  so I will call upon your name
     (Jesus )
      and keep my eyes above the waves when oceans rise, my soul will rest in    your embrace
       for i am yours (come on sing it up)   and you are mine
  oooh oooh oooh
and you are mine oooh oooh oooh
.
spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me
take me deeper than my feet could ever wonder, and my faith will be made stronger
in the presents of my saviour
     spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
let me walk upon the waters, wherever you would call me
take me deeper than my feet could ever wonder, and my faith will be made stronger
in the presents of my saviour
   spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
let me walk upon the waters wherever you would call me
take me deeper than my feet could ever wonder, and my faith will be made stronger
in the presents of my saviour
     spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
let me walk upon the waters wherever you would call me
take me deeper than my feet could ever wonder, and my faith will be made stronger in the presents of my saviour
