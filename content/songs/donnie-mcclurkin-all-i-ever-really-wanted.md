Searching for a lifetime for something to satisfy
Paid a lot of prices and so many nights I cried
In my time of desperation came a simple revelation
And that was all I ever really wanted was you
Thought I wanted money and I thought I wanted fame oh my
Thought it would fulfil me that's until it finally came
Then I sweetly hear you begging me and it only took one second
To see all I ever really wanted was you yeah
There were times I didn't know what I was to do
Said I didn't know what to think of you
But when I turned around, I turned and found
You were there all the time
I didn't know what or where to go
I didn't know what I was to know
But you loved till you loved my to the truth
Yes, you loved me like you
If there were a moral to the things that I have learned, yeah
It would be to follow love every move and every turn
In a time of second chances what I found at second glance is
Is that all I ever really wanted was you, yeah
There were times I didn't know what I was to do
I didn't know what to think of you
But when I turned around, I turned and found
You were there all the time
I didn't know what or where to go
Said I didn't know what I was to know
But then you loved till you loved my to the truth
Yeah, you loved me like you, yeah
If there were a moral for the things that I have learned oh huh
It would be to follow love every move and every turn
For in a time of second chances what I found at second glance is
Is that all I ever really wanted
You know I found in you, oh oh
All I ever really wanted somehow I now it's true, oh my
All I ever really wanted, you know I found in you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All I ever really wanted, somehow I now it's true, yeah
Oh all I ever really wanted was you, oh Lord
