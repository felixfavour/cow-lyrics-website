nd of unity
Land of peace
Seems mean so funny
But when I look around that is what I see
Land of such ethnic and cultural diversity
A land so rich, giant of Africa indeed
Land of champions
Land of the bests
In the midst of the adversities, we stood the test
And through al the best of this season, one day we'll
complete
I love naija
I love the green white green
Oooh oh
Unity and faith, peace and progress
God bless our nation!
God bless Nigeria!
In the midst of the abundance, so many people no dey enjoy
The benefits, and plenty gifts
Wey we get for under our soil
But I hope say
One day we go change our ways
So that in future generations
Nigeria will be a better place
Unity and faith, peace and progress
God bless our nation!
God bless Nigeria!
Unity and faith, peace and progress
God bless our nation!
God bless Nigeria!
Naija na your home
Naija na my home too
So make we join our hands make we make our own good
Unity and faith, peace and progress
God bless our nation!
God bless Nigeria!
God bless wazobia
God bless south
God bless middle belt
God bless 106 million
God bless this nation
God bless Nigeria
