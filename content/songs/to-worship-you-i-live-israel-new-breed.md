To worship You, I live
To worship You, I live

Even when my voice is gone, God
Yeah, to worship You, I live

To worship You, I live
To worship You, I live
I live to worship You
To worship You, I live (To worship You, I live)
To worship You, I live
I live to worship You
When you've done all you can do and said all you can say, cry out
Ooh-oh, oh-oh (Woah-oh)
Ooh-oh, oh-oh (Yeah, woah)
