For all You've done
For all You're going to do
We give You thanks
And lift our praise to You
We give thanks
We give praise
For we know
That all things work together
For our good
We give thanks
We give praise
For by faith
We know Your grace
Will see us through
For all those things
That we don't understand
We come by faith
And place them in Your hands
Even if we stumble
Even if we fall
You will not forsake us
You are King and Lord of all
Lord of all
