Oh miracle god, ebube
You are the god that delivered Israel
You fed them, 40 years in the wilderness
You are the Lord that lifted Joseph
From a prisoner to a prime minister
You are the Lord that fed Elijah
 why should I fear
You said seek your face, the kingdom of God
And every other thing shall be added onto you
Why should I fear why should I complain
You are the Lord, you are the God of miracle
You are the Lord God if al flesh
There is nothing, nothing to hard for you to do
No prayers you cannot answer, no womb you cannot open
No journey you cannot divide
No mountain you cannot crush
You are the God of Abraham
You visited Sarah ninety years
You are the Lord God of Moses
Why should I fear Jehovah
I am serving a God of miracle why should I fear

Greater is he that is in me
Than he that is in the world
You word is true oh
Let them gather  because its not of the Lord
The Lord shall scatter them in many many ways
I no dey fear you *

For my Jesus has conquered you so many years ago
Sister them tell you say you no go marry
Why should you fear
Them tell you say you no go born pikin
Why are you afraid
Them tell you say you no go succeed why are you afraid
For them that are with you
Are greater than them that are against you
For one with God is majority
Why are you afraid of your destiny
Are you the owner of your life
He knows you from your mothers womb
He knows your name
Baba knows your dwelling place
He knows the number of your hairs
He knows you when you came into this world
He knows your destiny, he knows *
