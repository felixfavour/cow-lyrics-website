[Intro]
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
Let my last breath here
Be my first with You
Where You rob my fear
And You make me new
[Pre-Chorus]
So whatever comes
Whatever I go through
Let my last breath here and be my first with You
The bells will ring, Your banner lifted high
Our Holy King and we, Your Holy Bride
I'll join with all the saints and lift my voice
When I see Your face
Through tears of joy
[Hook]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
