[Instrumental]
Who is like You, Lord in all the earth?
Matchless love and beauty, endless worth
Nothing in this world can satisfy
Jesus, You're the cup that won't run dry
Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me
Treasure of my heart and of my soul
In my weakness, You are merciful
Redeemer of my past and present wrongs
Holder of my future days to come
Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me
God, Your presence is heaven to me
There's nothing like Your presence
(Nothing like Your presence)
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
