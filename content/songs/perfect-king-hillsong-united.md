I've come to love on You
I've come to pledge my life to You
I've come to sit at Your feet
And sing sweet songs to You
I've come to give my life
To the greatest love of all
I've come to lift my hands to You
The desire of my heart
The lover of my soul
And I will worship You
With all my heart
For You are worthy
And I will bow to You
My perfect King Jesus
[Chorus] 2x
[Bridge] 3x
I love You Jesus
I love You Jesus
