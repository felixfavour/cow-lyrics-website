You're still the rock that I cling to
When everything else falls apart
You're still the One that I'm buildin' on
The reason my hope's never lost
You're the reason my hope's never lost
You come through now like You did back then
Time and time and time again
Almighty fortress, my defense
Time and time and time again
Oh, time and time and time again
Nothin' has ever been wasted
'Cause there's nothin' that You won't restore
As the waters rise I'll lift up my eyes
To where my help's comin' from
'Cause You're where my help's comin' from
'Cause You'll come through now like You did back then
Time and time and time again
Almighty fortress, my defense
Time and time and time again
Oh, time and time and time again
You put a new song in my mouth
Gave me somethin' to sing about
Set my feet upon that rock
I'm standin' on Your goodness, God
