You rule the nations with Your righteousness
All the kingdoms with Your holiness
You bare Your strong arms and the mountains shake
The whole world will fall at Your feet
You are the mighty King
Let all the people sing
Unto the King of Glory
You are the mighty King
Awesome in everything
Mighty King of Glory
All of creation tells of who You are
No others power can compare by far
You have conquered all Your enemies
And You'll reign forevermore
You are the mighty King
Let all the people sing
Unto the King of Glory
You are the mighty King
Awesome in everything
Mighty King of Glory
We praise the mighty King (8x)
