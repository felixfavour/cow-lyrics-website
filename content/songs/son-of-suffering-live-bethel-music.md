Oh, the perfect Son of God
In all His innocence
Here walking in the dirt with you and me
He knows what living is
He's acquainted with our grief
Man of sorrows, Son of suffering
[Chorus: David Funk]
Oh, blood and tears
How can it be?
That there's a God who weeps
There's a God who bleeds
Oh, praise the One
Who would reach for me
Hallelujah to the Son of suffering
Some imagine You
Are distant and removed
But You chased us down in merciful pursuit
To the sinner, You were grace
And the broken You еmbraced
And in the end, thе proof is in Your wounds
Yes, in the end, the proof is in Your wounds
