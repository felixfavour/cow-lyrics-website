I've tried so hard to see it
Took me so long to believe it
That You choose someone like me
To carry Your victory
Perfection could never earn it
You give what we don't deserve it
You take the broken things
And raise them to glory
You are my Champion
Giants fall when You stand
Undefeated
Every battle You've won
I am who you say I am
You crown me with confidence
I am seated
In the heavenly place
Undefeated
With the One who has conquered it all
Now I can finally see it
You're teaching me how to receive it
So let all the striving cease
This is my victory
You are my Champion
Giants fall when You stand
Undefeated
Every battle You've won
I am who you say I am
You crown me with confidence
I am seated
In the heavenly place
Undefeated
With the One who has conquered it all
When I lift my voice and shout
Every wall comes crashing down
I have the authority
Jesus has given me
When I open up my mouth
Miracles start breaking out
I have the authority
Jesus has given me
When I lift my voice and shout
Every wall comes crashing down
I have the authority
Jesus has given me
When I open up my mouth
Miracles start breaking out
I have the authority
Jesus has given me
You are my Champion
Giants fall when You stand
Undefeated
Every battle You've won
I am who you say I am
You crown me with confidence
I am seated
In the heavenly place
Undefeated
By the power of Your name
I am seated
In the heavenly place
Undefeated
With the One who has conquered it all
When I lift my voice and shout
Every wall comes crashing down
I have the authority
Jesus has given me
When I open up my mouth
Miracles start breaking out
I have the authority
Jesus has given me
When I lift my voice and shout
Every wall comes crashing down
I have the authority
Jesus has given me
When I open up my mouth
Miracles start breaking out
I have the authority
Jesus has given me
You are my Champion
Giants fall when You stand
Undefeated
Every battle You've won
I am who you say I am
You crown me with confidence
I am seated
In the heavenly place
Undefeated
By the power of Your name
I am seated
In the heavenly place
Undefeated
With the One who has conquered it all
