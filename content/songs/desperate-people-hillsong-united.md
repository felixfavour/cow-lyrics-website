You crossed the great divide You took our place
You offered up Your life though we had failed
The veil was torn and love remained
You are holy Lord
Distraction cast aside we seek Your face
We offer up our lives to bring You praise
A love that walls cannot contain
You are holy Lord
[Pre-Chorus]
We're rising up in spirit and in truth
A living sacrifice we worship You
A people undivided Lord hear us sing
We are Yours and You are our King
This is our love hearts joined as one
Desperate for all You are
Lord break down these walls
And see how we run
Desperate for all You want
We chase Your heart
