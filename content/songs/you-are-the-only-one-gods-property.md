[Intro]
Come on (What you say now)
All right (Uh huh, Uh huh)
Come on (What you say now)
All right (What you say now)
Come on (What you say now)
All right (What you, what you say now)
Come on (What you say now)
All right (What you say now)
GP sing it with me, come on
[Interlude]
All the young people driving down the street in their Jeeps
I want you to pump this up real loud so the neighborhood can hear you
So it can be one time for your holy mind
Here we go...
You are the only one who makes me feel this way
You turn my night to day
Lord I just came to say
To tell You that
You are the only one who came and took me in
You've been that kind of friend
You're the only one
You're the one
