Heaven, heaven on earth!
Heaven!

The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
His anointing is empowering

The kingdom of the Lord is within me
And He's calling me to the heavenlies
To be seated in heavenly places

Just like heaven...
Just like heaven on earth!
To be walking in His favor and grace
Just like heaven...
Just like heaven on earth!

Heaven, heaven on earth!

Heaven!

Marching in the Spirit of unity
To our community show His ability
The will of the Lord for His children
Is to demonstrate, perpetuate

To be seated in heavenly places
Just like Heaven...
Just like heaven on earth!

To be walking in His favor and grace
Just like heaven...
Just like heaven on earth!

Heaven, heaven on earth!
Heaven!
