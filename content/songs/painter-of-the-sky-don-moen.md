There is no other name in heaven
There is no other name on the earth
By which we can be saved
There is no other way
So we worship, You, our king
And give You everything
Chorus:
There is none like You
Painter of the sky
Bright and morning star
Shine into our lives
There is none like You
Beginning and the end
All-consuming fire
Ignite our hearts again
There is no other love like Jesus
There is no other friend so true
No other hand of grace
No other hiding place
You're the Lamb of sacrifice
The glory of our lives
(Chorus)
