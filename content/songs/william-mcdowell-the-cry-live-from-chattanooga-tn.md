the cry  (live from chattanooga, tn ) william McDowell
There is a cry
That comes from our hearts
To the One who can satisfy it all
He will answer when we call
There is a sound
Released from the depths of our souls
To the One who holds it all
He will answer when we call
There is a cry
That comes from our hearts
To the One who can satisfy it all
He will answer when we call
There is a sound
Released from the depths of our souls
To the One who holds it all
He will answer when we call
So we cry with humble expectation
We cry with a sound of desperation
We'll cry 'til we get Your attention
Lord, come have Your way
And show us Your glory
We cry with humble expectation
We cry with a sound of desperation
We'll cry 'til we get Your attention
Lord, come have Your way
And show us Your glory
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We want to see
Hearts on fire with burning desire for You
Broken chains
Healing all over this room
Revival
You hear our cry
We want to see
Hearts on fire with burning desire for You
Broken chains
Healing all over this room
Revival
You hear our cry
We want to see
Hearts on fire with burning desire for You
Broken chains
Healing all over this room
Revival
You hear our cry
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
We won't stop until we see it
