Alive In You"
(feat. Nia Allen)
Before my mother's womb
You were with me
Before I heard Your voice
You were calling
You cause the earth to tremble
But whisper with a still, small voice
I'm alive in You, I'm alive in You
The Spirit of the Lord says
I'm alive in You, I'm alive in You
The Spirit of the Lord says
So, I'll submit my will, Spirit lead me
Through every winding road and every valley
And when the darkness finds me
It's Your voice that lights the way
I'm alive in You, I'm alive in You
The Spirit of the Lord says
I'm alive in You, I'm alive in You
The Spirit of the Lord says
I'm alive in You, I'm alive in You
The Spirit of the Lord says
I'm alive in You, I'm alive in You
The Spirit of the Lord says
You made a promise, You'd never leave us
Walk us through the fire, this is our reminder
My faith is rising, I won't keep quiet
And from here to heaven, I'll sing of Your goodness
You made a promise, You'd never leave us
Walk us through the fire, this is our reminder
My faith is rising, I won't keep quiet
And from here to heaven, I'll sing of Your goodness
You made a promise, You'd never leave us
Walk us through the fire, this is our reminder
My faith is rising, I won't keep quiet
And from here to heaven, I'll sing of Your goodness
I'm alive in You, I'm alive in You
The Spirit of the Lord says
I'm alive in You, I'm alive in You
The Spirit of the Lord says
You made a promise, You'd never leave us
Walk us through the fire, this is our reminder
My faith is rising, I won't keep quiet
And from here to heaven, I'll sing of Your goodness
You made a promise, You'd never leave us
Walk us through the fire, this is our reminder
My faith is rising, I won't keep quiet
And from here to heaven, I'll sing of Your goodness
And from here to heaven, I'll sing of Your goodness
And from here to heaven, I'll sing of Your goodness
I'm alive in You, I'm alive in You
The Spirit of the Lord says
I'm alive in You, I'm alive in You
The Spirit of the Lord says
The Spirit of the Lord says
The Spirit of the Lord says
If God said it, I believe it
If God said it, I believe it
If God said it, I believe it
The Spirit of the Lord says
If God said it, I believe it
If God said it, I believe it
If God said it, I believe it
The Spirit of the Lord says
If God said it, I believe it
If God said it, I believe it
If God said it, I believe it
The Spirit of the Lord says
If God said it, I believe it
If God said it, I believe it
If God said it, I believe it
The Spirit of the Lord says
If God said it, I believe it
If God said it, I believe it
If God said it, I believe it
The Spirit of the Lord says
The Spirit of the Lord says
The Spirit of the Lord says
The Spirit of the Lord says
