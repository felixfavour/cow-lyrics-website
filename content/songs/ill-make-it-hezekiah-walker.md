I was down to my last dime
But Jesus stepped in right on time
I sure been sick and I couldn't get well
When He healed my body and I can tell that it's
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
I was lost without a friend
Then I met Jesus and He took me in
In all of your temptation, He'll keep the faith
He already planned a way for you to escape
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
Alright now
Think I'll make it
Anyhow
