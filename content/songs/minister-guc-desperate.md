Lord it is me, The one You Love, Lord it is me
Lord it is me, The one You saved, Lord it is me
I am desperate for You o, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh,
I am desperate for You o oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh. (x2)
[Solo]
Lord it is me, The one You Love, Lord it is me
Lord it is me, The one You saved, I am hear again o nI am desperate for You God (tongues)
I am desperate for Your loving, Desperate for You, wide with open arms
Na me be this, The one wey You gbadu, na me be this God,
You Don become my mama,
You Don become my papa, Na me be this o.

Lord we are here, The ones You love, Lord we are here
Lord we are here, The ones You saved, Lord we are here
We are open to you o, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh,
We are open to You o, oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh. (x2)
