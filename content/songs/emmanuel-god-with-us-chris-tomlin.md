Go tell it on the mountain
The one that we’ve been waiting for
The King of our salvation
Born on this day, our savior Christ the Lord
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
That we can be forgiven
The weight of all our sin He came to bear
Emmanuel, God with us, Emmanuel, King Jesus
The Savior of the world is born
Emmanuel, God with us, Emmanuel, King Jesus
The Savior of the world is born
Go tell it on the mountain
Humbly in a manger lay
Mercy sent from Heavеn
The angels fill the sky with highеst praise
Emmanuel, God with us, Emmanuel, King Jesus
The Savior of the world is born
Emmanuel, God with us, Emmanuel, King Jesus
The Savior of the world is born
