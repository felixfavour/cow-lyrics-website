Upon the hill on Calvary
He came from Heaven?s throne
Our fallenness and mercy meet
Where blood and water flow
What grace divine what selflessness
That Christ would bear the weight
Our proof is scarred on hands that bled
That we were worth every nail
Chorus:
And all the praise and glory to God
We sing Hallelujah sing Hallelujah
For the King has carried the cross
He is risen from the grave
Beyond the tomb to holy skies
He rose in victory
And bridged for us the great divide
His life is our liberty
Chorus x2
