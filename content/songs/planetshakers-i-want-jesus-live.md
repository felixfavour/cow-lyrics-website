Here I
Am Lord vulnerable
Ready
For You to come and move
This is
Where my heart belongs
With Your presence
Come and consume me
I feel
Wonder fill the room
You're here
I am
Overwhelmed
As I
Let go
I receive
With Your presence
Come and consume me
Come and consume me
I want Jesus
More than anything
I want Jesus
All over again
I live life each day
In Your embrace
I want Jesus
I want Jesus
Feels like
Heaven when You're here
Waves of
Glory
They cover me
Let Your Spirit saturate
With Your presence
Come and consume me
Come and consume me
I want Jesus
More than anything
I want Jesus
All over again
I live life each day
In Your embrace
I want Jesus
I want Jesus
More than anything
I want Jesus
All over again
I live life each day in Your embrace
I want Jesus
I want Jesus
More than anything else
My heart cries out for You
Jesus
More than anything else
My soul it longs
My soul it longs for You
More than anything else
My heart cries out for You
Jesus
More than anything else
My soul it longs
My soul it longs for You
I want Jesus
More than anything
I want Jesus
All over again
I live life each day in Your embrace
I want Jesus
I want Jesus
I want Jesus
More than anything else
My heart cries out for You
Jesus
More than anything else
My soul it longs
My soul it longs for You
More than anything else
My heart cries out for You
Jesus
More than anything else
My soul it longs
My soul it longs for You
