When you come into His presence
Lifting up the name of Jesus
And you hear the music playin'
And you see the people praisin';
Just forget about your worries
Let your troubles fall behind you
Don't you wait another minute
Just get up and on your feet and...
Get to dancing, singing, jumping, leaping
Get to shouting, and make it loud, and make it glorious
Start rejoicing, praising, lifting, raising
Get to shouting, and make it loud
And make His praise glorious, glorious
Get to dancing, singing, jumping, leaping
Get to shouting, and make it loud, and make it glorious
Start rejoicing, praising, lifting, raising
Get to shouting, and make it loud
And make His praise...
