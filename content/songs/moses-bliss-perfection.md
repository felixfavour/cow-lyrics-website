yeah yeah yeah yeah
I am perfect in everything
God have said it,that is what it is/2x
then,I am walking in His Glory
walking in His Grace
walking in perfection
and just the way it is/2x
my life is not ordinary
but the Holy spirit lives inside me
and in everything I do
I do it just like Jesus
cause I function like the spirit
and am perfect in the Lord
yeah yeah yeah
look at what I see
look at what I hear
cause the word of God is in my mouth
and it shows me who I am
am never never moved by what I see,
not by what I hear
the word of God is in my mouth
and it shows me who I am
and I am walking in his Glory
am walking in his grace
am walking in perfection
that's just the way it is(chorus)
