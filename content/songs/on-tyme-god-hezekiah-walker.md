Ever feel like the Lord never hears your prayer
Ever feel like the Lord ain't even there
The devil is a liar I know that Jesus cares
When I call Him, He will answer
Never leave me hangin
Don't front this is bangin
Clap your hands if you believe
He's an on tyme God
He's an on tyme God
Yes he is, yes he is [x2]
Ever been a time in your life when all of the hopе was gone
All around the world you know it's just the samе old song
Jesus can you help me, just tell me where I went wrong
When I call Him, He will answer
Never leave me hangin
Don't front this is bangin
Clap your hands if you believe
