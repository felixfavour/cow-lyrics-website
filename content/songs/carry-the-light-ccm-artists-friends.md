In this world of darkness
We are given light
Hope for all the dying
How will they know?
How will they know?
[Pre-Chorus: John Schlitt & 
Margaret Becker
]
That Jesus loves them
And He died to save them?
[Chorus: Choir & 
Sharon Batts
]
Carry the light (carry the light)
Carry the light
Go, and tell the children
They are precious in His sight
[Chorus: Choir, 
Take 6
 & 
Michael W. Smith
]
Carry the light (carry the light)
Carry the light
Go, and preach the gospel
'Til there is no more night
In the name of Jesus Christ
Carry the light
Count them by the millions
Blinded slaves to sin
But inside, they are dyin'
How will they know?
How will they know?
