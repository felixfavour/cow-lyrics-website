Your breath in my breath
The fire deep inside
You listen through my ears
The vision in my eyes
You are closer than, closer than close
You are closer than closer than close
You are closer than, closer than close
You are closer than closer than close
The breath in my breath
Glory of my life
You listen to my prayers
Yet You're my heart desire
The breath in my breath
Glory of my life
Oh, oh, God, most holy God
You are closer, than closer than close
Oh, oh, oh, God, this is holy love
You are closer, than closer than close
eeeeeeeeee
eeeeeeeeeeeeeee
We will never be the same again
We have touched the hem of His garment
We are forever transformed
Forever renewed
He is forever our Father o
Abba o, Abba o
Oh, oh this is holy
Oh, oh this is beautiful
Oh, oh this is wonderful to me
This is wonderful to me
Oh, oh, this is holy (this is holy)
Oh, oh, this is beautiful (this is beautiful)
Oh, oh, this is wonderful to me
You are closer than, closer than close
Closer than, closer than close
Closer than, closer than close to me
You are closer, than closer than close
Closer than, closer than close
Oh, this is wonderful to me
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaahhhhh

Oh, oh this is beautiful
Oh, oh, this is wonderful to me
Oh, oh, this is holy
Oh, oh, this is beautiful
Oh, oh, this is wonderful to me
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaahhhhh
Hallel
It's a wonder and it's a mystery.
It's still a wonder to many God.
Perhaps Jesus in our worship,
We unravel the mystery that
You have hidden in who we are Lord.
For perhaps this is the mystery
of our worship.
He has something so great for His children.
And every time they worship Him,
Every time they fix their gaze on Him.
In their eyes they see a picture of
who they truly are
In their eyes they see they see
A burning fire
Jesus , such an intimate
Exchange of identity
Such an intimate exchange of power
Such an intimate glory oh God
That I step into your presence,
And you say here I am.
And as I take a look at my father
I realize I'm not so broken
I'm not so weak, I'm not so small.
If this is my Father, then there must be
Something within me that looks like Him.
For a lion gives birth to a lion
Fire gives birth to fire.
The light gives birth to light.
This is worship, the intimate
Exchange of identity.
