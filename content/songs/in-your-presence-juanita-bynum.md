In Your presence
That's where I belong
In Your presence
O Lord my God
In Your presence
That's where I'm made strong
Seeking Your face
Touching Your grace
In the cleft of the Rock
In Your presence O God

And I want to go
Where the rivers
Can not overflow me
Where my feet
Are on the Rock
And I just want to hide
Where the blazing fire
Can not burn me
In the cleft of the Rock

In Your presence
That's where I belong
In Your presence
O Lord my God
In Your presence
That's where I'm made strong
Seeking Your face
Touching Your grace
In the cleft of the Rock
In Your presence O God

And I want to hide
Where the flood of evil
Cannot reach me
Where I'm covered by Your blood
And I just gotta be
Where the schemes of darkness
Can not touch me
In the cleft of the Rock

In Your presence
That's where I belong
In Your presence
O Lord my God
In Your presence
That's where I belong
Seeking Your face
Touching Your grace
In the cleft of the Rock
O Jesus
In Your presence
