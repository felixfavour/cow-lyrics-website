Now everything is still The bedlam
And the noise at bay
And all the busy birds have flown
My melancholy heart
Is beating with the perfect peace
One that I have always known
Hey love it's me
Hey love it's me
I need you at the closing of the day
I need you when the night has peeled away
In other words I need you always
I'm coming with a million songs to sing
Still there not a word for everything
I want to say love, but anyway love
Let me start with this
Oh hey love (hey love)
We're circling the sun
We're basking in the afterglow
It's back around to me and you
Come sail away with me
We can talk about old times
We're heading into something new
