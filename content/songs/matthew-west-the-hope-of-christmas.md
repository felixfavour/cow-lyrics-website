Take me back to eight years old
The little church on a dead end road
With a candle flicker in one hand
And dad's hand in the other
Take me back to silent night
My heart was full and the world was right
'Cause right now the world looks nothin' like
Those innocent Decembers
These days peace on Earth is hard to find
And I need you to remind me one more time
You're still the hope of Christmas
You're still the light when the world looks dark
You're still the hope of Christmas
And You're still the hope of my heart
Watch the snowflakes fallin' down
Like a blanket on this town
For a moment we can hardly see
The pain this year has brought us
May the sick find healing's touch
May hatred's fight be one with love
And may every heart make room for You
The one who came to save us
'Cause You're still the hope of Christmas
You're still the light when the world looks dark
You're still the hope of Christmas
And You're still the hope of my heart
You're the hope of Christmas
I bowed my head to pray tonight
Felt my little girl by my side
She slipped her tiny hand in mine
And we both talked to You
And it took me back to 8 years old
My daddy's hand and a story told
About Heaven's love and the manger lo
And a promise that's still true
You're still the hope of Christmas
You're still the light when the world looks dark
You're still the hope of Christmas
And You're still the hope of my heart
You're still the hope of Christmas
You're still the light when the world looks dark
You're still the hope of Christmas
You're still the hope of my heart
