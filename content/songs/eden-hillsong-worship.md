O Eden's tree
Where the seed of sin began
And the serpent thought it my defeat
I found Your grace
When I least deserved a chance
For I am Adam
I am Eve
And you made clothes to cover me
Now and then
Start to end
You are still restoring
For there is more
Up ahead
Than all that's gone before me
A life beyond mistakes
For Eden's not the end
O Calvary's tree
Where the second Adam died
And the devil tasted his defeat
Still I found Your grace
When I least deserved a chance
For I'm a thief upon a tree
And You say Glory waits for me
