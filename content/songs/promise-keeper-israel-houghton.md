[Chorus: Israel Houghton & 
Travis Greene
]
Promise Keeper, You will never fail
Your love is true
Promise Keeper, You deliver
On Your word
And I will trust You
You never lie, You never lie
You see my need, You hear my cry
You never fail, You never fail
You never have, You never will
[Pre-Chorus 1: Israel Houghton]
O-o-ooh
Your word remains forever
[Chorus: Israel Houghton & Travis Greene]
Promise Keeper, You will never fail
Your love is true
Promise Keeper, You deliver
On Your word
And I will trust You
You never sleep, You never sleep
You keep Your hand and Your eye on me
You always will, You always will
You're faithful now,  You were faithful then
