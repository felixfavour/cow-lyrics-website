red of hiding
Dead man's awakening
Old life behind me
Mourning is breaking
You're calling me out
Just as I am
Filthy now Holy
Your Spirit inside me
Graves into glory
Reviving whats dying
You're calling me out
Just as I am
From death to life, You'll be Glorified
The stone, You're moving is proving your might
I'm letting go, I'm leaving my Grave Clothes
The stone behind me
Real love before me
Breath in this body
Sinking in glory
You've called me out
Just as I am
From death to life, You'll be Glorified
The stone, You're moving is proving your might
I'm letting go, I'm leaving my Grave
My soul was sleeping, awakened to life
I dance in your freedom, I'm dressed in your light
I'm letting go, I'm leaving my Grave Clothes
Come and see
He's awakening
He is calling the grave back to life
Come and see
See his glory
He is calling the grave back to life
From death to life, You'll be Glorified
The stone, You're moving is proving your might
I'm letting go, I'm leaving my Grave
My soul was sleeping, awakened to life
I dance in your freedom, I'm dressed in your light
I'm letting go, I'm leaving my Grave Clothes
I'm leaving my Grave Clothes
