Trouble won't throw me, won't break me
Won't scare me no more
Fear must have thought I was faithless
When it came for my heart
[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I got a song that will never die
I know Your love is the reason why
I'll sing the night into the morning
I'll sing the fear into Your praise
I'll sing my soul into Your presence
Whenever I say Your name
Let the devil know not today
Let the devil know not today
Tell me did the enemy panic
As You took up that cross?
Tell me did the darkness cry mercy
As You rolled back that rock?
[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I know Your life is the life in mine
I know Your love is the reason why
