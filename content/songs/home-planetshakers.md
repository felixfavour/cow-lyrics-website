[Intro]
Home
Home
Now, my heart is open now
Your love advances, breaks my defences down
Go, Jesus, I始m letting go
Your grace is greater than every failure
Now I始m coming
Home, I know I am home
Safe within my Saviour's arms
Right back where I belong
Home
Home
Fall, Father, You broke my fall
Your mercy found me, wrapped arms around me
Now I始m coming
Now I'm running
Home, I know I am home
Safe within my Saviour's arms
Right back where I belong
Home, I始m forgiven, home
I hear Heaven's angels sing
Father, You welcome me
Home
