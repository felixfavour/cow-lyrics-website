God, Your presence
Means more than anything, more than anything
Just one moment
Is all I really need, all I really need
[Pre-Chorus]
There's fullness of joy, pleasures forevermore
In Your presence Lord
Closer, closer to Your heart
Close enough to hear Your voice, Lord
Never let me stray too far
Father, hold me in Your arms
Father, open
Heaven over me, Heaven over me
One word spoken
Changes everything, changes everything
[Pre-Chorus]
There's fullness of joy, pleasures forevermore
In Your presence Lord
