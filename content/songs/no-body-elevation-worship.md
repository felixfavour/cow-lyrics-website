Behold the Lamb upon the cross
Who takes away the sins of all
Forgiveness flows from hands and feet
As violence meets the Prince of Peace
Behold the King
[Chorus: Jonsal Barrientes]
Light of the world, Lamb that was slain
Lion who rose, mighty to save
The fullness of God won't be kept in a grave
Darkness, your hour is over
Behold the love, His dying plea
Behold the grace of calvary
That rugged cross, soon to be
The emblem of a risen King
Behold the King
[Chorus: Jonsal Barrientes]
Light of the world, Lamb that was slain
Lion who rose, mighty to save
The fullness of God won't be kept in a grave
Darkness, your hour is over
Light of the world, Lamb that was slain
Lion who rose, mighty to save
The fullness of God won't be kept in a grave
Darkness, your hour is over
