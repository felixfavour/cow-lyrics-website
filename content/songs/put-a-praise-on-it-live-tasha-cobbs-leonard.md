[Intro]
Hey, let's go
’Cause there's a miracle in this room
With my name on it
I need some radical praisers back in the back to wave at me
There's a healing in this room, I see you back there
And it’s here for me
Can I declare it over your life?
There's a breakthrough, it's in this room
And it's got my name on it
I need somebody to holler right there
Oh! Oh-oh-oh-ohhh
So I'm gonna put a praise on it
Can I sing it like I feel it?
I'm gonna put a praise on it (Oh, yeahhh)
Can I sing it like I feel it? Somebody say, yeah
'Cause there's a miracle in this room
With Tasha’s name on it
There’s a healing in this room
Anybody need healing?
And it's here for me
There’s a breakthrough, it's in this room
And it's got my name on it
Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!
I'm gonna put a praise on it
Somebody put a praise on it (Oh, yeahhh)
You outta put a praise on it (Oh, yeahhh)
I need you to lean on your neighbor like this and say
"Can you help me put a praise on it?" (Oh, yeahhh) 141
Let’s go, let's go
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Let's turn it up Passion, let's go, come on
Let's say it together
