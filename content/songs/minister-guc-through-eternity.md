THROUGH ETERNITY Lyrics by GUC
You've been here
Before Time Began
Yet You still know my Name
You Existed Through Eternity
Yet You still know my Name
You've been here
Before Time Began
Yet You still know my Name
You Existed Through Eternity
Yet You still know my Name
[Pre  Chorus]
Elohim, Elyon
You Remain The Same
Elohim, Adonai
What an Awesome God You are
Yeah, Yeah

You've been here
Before Time Began
Yet You still know my Name
You Existed Through Eternity
Yet You still know my Name

Before Time Began
Yet You still know my Name
You Existed Through Eternity
