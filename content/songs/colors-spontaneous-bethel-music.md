[Intro: Brian Johnson]
Oh, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Only You and You alone
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-ooh
You make all things new
You make all things new
When You walk in the room
You make all things new
When You walk into the room
Would You walk into the room?
Would You walk into the room?
Would You walk into the room, yeah?
Would You walk into the room?
[Chorus: Lindsey Strand]
Bring Your color in my life
Bring Your color in my life
Wipe away the dullness
Bring Your color in my life
Mmm, bring Your color in my life
