"Crashing"
When You love, You love with no limits
When You love, You love with no boundaries
When You love, You love without ending
No one else can love me like You do
When You love, You love with no limits
When You love, You love with no boundaries
When You love, You love without ending
No one else can love the way You do
An endless love, like waterfalls
And it's crashing down on me
Relentless love, like waterfalls
And it's crashing down on me
When You love, You love with no limits
When You love, You love with no boundaries
When You love, You love without ending
No one else can love the way You do
No one else can love the way You do
An endless love, like waterfalls
And it's crashing down on me
Relentless love, like waterfalls
And it's crashing down on me
Your love is running after me
Your love is running after me
Never gives up, never runs out
Always fighting for me
Your love is running after me
Your love is running after me
Never gives up, never runs out
Always fighting for me
Your love is running after me
Your love is running after me
Never gives up, never runs out
Always fighting for me
Your love is running after me
Your love is running after me
Never gives up, never runs out
Always fighting for me
Your love is running after me
Your love is running after me
Never gives up, never runs out
Always fighting for me
An endless love, like waterfalls
And it's crashing down on me
Relentless love, like waterfalls
And it's crashing down on me
