I could Sing of Your Love
For a Thousand Years
I could never be able to
Exhaust the Wealth of it
For God so Loved the World
That He gave His
Only Son for Me O
Love is the Answer for Life

No, No Fear in Your Love
I'm Amazed at Your Love
How You Pour out
Your Love for me
No, No Fear in Your Love
I'm Amazed at Your Love
Your Everlasting Love for me
(What a Powerful Love
Unchangeable Love
Your Everlasting Love for me)
In John Chapter Eight
Verse One to Ten
Mary Magdalene
Was Guilty as Charged
But in the Place of Condemnation
You gave her Love
Master Jesus
Master Jesus Omegom ife
I am like that Samaritan Woman
When I Tasted of Your Love
I couldn't keep it to myself

No, No Fear in Your Love
I'm Amazed at Your Love
How You Pour out
Your Love for me
No, No Fear in Your Love
I'm Amazed at Your Love
Your Everlasting Love for me
You know the Story
Of the Prodigal Son
With all that he did Oh
You are Still a Son
Because nothing can undo
The Love that Jesus give
Master Jesus
Jesus, Your Love
Changed my Life
I am not Afraid of Tomorrow
My Tomorrow is in You
My Tomorrow is You

No, No Fear in Your Love
I'm Amazed at Your Love
I'm in Awe of Your Love for me
No, No Fear in Your Love
I'm Amazed at Your Love

I'm Amazed at Your Love
How You Pour out
Your Love for me
No, No Fear in Your Love
I'm Amazed at Your Love
Your Everlasting Love for me
