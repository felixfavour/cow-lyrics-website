Oh Hallelujah
Don't look like what I have been through
A vessel that is broken by the Lord
Unworthy but He chose me I'm a living testimony.
Don't look like what I have been through
I'm a vessel that is broken by the Lord
Unworthy but he chose me
I'm a living testimony.
This is what I went through
I went through fire, it didn't burn me
I went through pain, it didn't kill me
I'm unworthy but He kept me
I'm a living testimony eeee
I went through fire, it didn't burn me
I went through pain, it didn't kill me
I'm unworthy but He fought for me
I'm a living testimony
I went through shame, It didn't kill me
I went through heart break
It didn't end me
Unworthy, but He came through for me.
I'm a Living Testimony
I went Through Fire
It didn't Burn me
I went Through Pain
It didn't Kill me
I'm Unworthy, but He
Came through for me.
I'm a Living Testimony
So, I will bow down,
And fix my eyes.
(The eyes of my heart)
Till my Last Breath
So, I will bow down,
And fix this Heart,
Till my Last Breath
So, I will bow down,
And fix my Heart,
Till my Last Breath
So, I will bow down,
And fix my Heart,
Till my Last Breath
