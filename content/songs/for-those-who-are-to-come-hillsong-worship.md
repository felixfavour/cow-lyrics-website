Since we are surrounded
By such a great cloud of witnesses
Let us run, let us run, with perseverance
The race marked out, let us make a way
For those who are to come, those who are to come
Every generation, every nation
Every tribe, every tongue
They will sing, they will cry, oh
With one voice,  they will sing
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna, hosanna
