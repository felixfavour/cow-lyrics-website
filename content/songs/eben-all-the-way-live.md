I know you feeling this song
And you like this boy
Feeeling my swag
Will you sing along
Hi hi high...
Put the sorrow away
Far away
Lets celebrate
All the way
No matter who you are
No matter who you are
No matter where your from
You sing along
Praise the Lord
Hi hi high
Lets celebrate
All the way
Brigde
So we go dey thank the lord for him mercys
Thank the lord for the things wey him do
Save me up and kept me from falling
Now my life is turn to brand new
Oh o hi (hi high)
Make we jolly
Shake body
The party don start
We go the hail
Hail your name
Day by day
All the way
All the way
We go the hail
Hail your name
Day by day
All the way
All the way
See my life i'm balling
All the money pileing
Baby no more dulling
Like the eagel i'm soaring
Hi hi high
No more delay
No delay
We be going higher
Forward ever
Loke loke
Backward never
Owom be na ko ri o
Ijo ti ya
E jo me ko o
Brigde
So we go dey thank the lord for him mercys

We go the hail
Hail your name
Day by day

I go horror on the enemies
The fall like a domino
So hot to reach when i criuse around
