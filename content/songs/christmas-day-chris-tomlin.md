Joy to the world
On a night like no other
Emmanuel
God is with us
Beggars and kings
Let us come and adore Him
Rest in His peace
And bow before Him
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin & 
We The Kingdom
]
Sing all you people
The Lord almighty reigns
Sing every creature of God
Come bless His name
For He is good, for He is good
He was born to conquer the grave
Light of the world
The reason for Christmas Day
Stars we have seen
Over deserts and oceans
The darkness was deep
But never hopeless
Redemption came
And His name is Jesus
