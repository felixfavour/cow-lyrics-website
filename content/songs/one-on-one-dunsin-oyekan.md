Everybody clap your...
Everybody clap your...
As faces are different
So our needs are
We have a father
Who's capable of reaching us
One on one
As faces are different
So our needs are
We have a father
Who's capable of reaching us
One on one
Though we are many
Yet you're engaging us
One on one
Though we are many
Your hand is touching us
One on one
Though we are many
Yet you're engaging us
Onе on one
Though we are many
Your hand is touching us
Onе on one
