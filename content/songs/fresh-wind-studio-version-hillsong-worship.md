Spirit sound
Rushing wind
Fire of God fall within
Holy Ghost
Breathe on us we pray
As we repent
Turn from sin
Revival embers smouldering
Breath of God
Fan us into flame
We need a fresh Wind
The fragrance of Heaven
Pour Your Spirit out
Pour Your Spirit out
For hearts that burn
With holy fear
Purified in faith and deed
Refinerâ€™s fire
Strengthen what remains
