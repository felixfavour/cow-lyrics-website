How beautiful you are! Oh lord
How magnificent are the works of your hand
Oh oh oh oh
The stars display your greatness and your wonder
Every sparkle and every twinkle explain your beauty further
The sun display the beauty of your love
Shining brightly above the skies for every man to see
The price you paid shows the worth of my life
From Calvary to heaven you're constantly thinking of me
The cross display the depth of your wisdom
Turning a symbol of shame to an icon of grace
The word you painted on the canvas of love
Our lives you beautified with goodness grace and joy
Your glory seen in everything that you have made
How magnificent are the works of your hand
The word you painted on the canvas of your love
Our lives you beautified with goodness grace and joy
Your glory seen in everything that you have made
 How magnificent are the works of your hand
Lord we praise you lord, how beautiful you are
How magnificent are the works, are the works of your hand
The price you paid shows the worth of my life
From Calvary to heaven you're constantly thinking of me
The cross display the depth of your wisdom
Turning a symbol of shame to an icon of grace
The word you painted on the canvas of love
Our lives you beautified with goodness grace and joy
Your glory seen in everything that you have made
 How magnificent are the works of your hand
The word you painted on the canvas of love
Our lives you beautified with goodness grace and joy
Your glory seen in everything that you have made
 How magnificent are the works of your hand
We praise your name almighty God
Author of Salvation, the beauty of creation
We praise your name almighty God (repeat)
