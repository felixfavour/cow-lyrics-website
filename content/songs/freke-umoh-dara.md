There will never be any God like Jehovah We will never see anyone like you Lord Anywhere you go goodness and mercy go follow
Anywhere you dey miracles go dey flow No be you dey make lame walk?
No be you dey make blind see?
No be you dey raise the dead oh?
Na you!
You alone are faithful
I am very grateful
That is why I praise you like this oh

Idara idara odu o.(There is joy)
