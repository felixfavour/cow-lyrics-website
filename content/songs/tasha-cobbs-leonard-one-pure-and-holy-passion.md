"One Pure And Holy Passion"
I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus
(Help me sing that Bre)
I have decided to follow Jesus
Yeah
I have decided to follow Jesus
Give me one pure and holy passion
Give me one magnificent obsession
Give me one glorious ambition for my life
To know and follow hard after you, hard after you
Give me one pure and holy passion
Give me one magnificent obsession
Give me one glorious ambition for my life, Lord
To know and follow hard after you, hard after you
Oh, I wanna follow you
Oh to know and follow hard after you
(To know and follow hard after you)
To go as your disciple in your truth
(To go as your disciple)
This world is empty, pale and poor
Compared to knowing you my Lord
Lead me on and I will run after you
Lead me on and I will run after you
To know and follow hard after you
(To know and follow hard after you)
To go as your disciple in your truth
(To go as your disciple)
This world is empty, pale and poor
Compared to knowing you my Lord
Lead me on and I will run after you
Lead me on and I will run after you
(Somebody ask him say)
Lead me on and I will run after you
(We make this back to you Lord say)
Lead me on and I will run after you
(Say lead me on)
Lead me on and I will run after you
(Somebody say lead me on)
Lead me on and I will run after you
(Lead me on)
Lead me on and I will run after you
(Oh am gonna follow you)
Lead me on and I will run after you
(Lead me on)
Lead me on and I will run after you
(Am gonna run after you Lord)
Lead me on and I will run after you
(Say lead me on)
Lead me on and I will run after you
(Ooh, lead me on)
Lead me on and I will run after you
