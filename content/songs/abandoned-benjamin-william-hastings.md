Somethin' isn't adding up
This wild exchange You offer us
I gave my worst, You gave Your blood
Seems hard to believe
You're tellin' me You chose the Cross?
You're tellin' me I'm worth that much?
Well, if that's the measure of Your love
How else would I sing?
But completely, deeply, sold-out, sincerely abandoned
I'm completely, freely, hands-to-the-ceiling enamored
My one-life endeavor
To match Your surrender
To mirror not my will, but Yours
Oh, I'm completеly, deeply, don't-care-who-sees-me abandoned
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I surrеnder all
I just can't get over it
What kind of self-control is this?
When You had angels at Your fingertips
But on the Cross You remained
And I can't repay that kind of love
But I can praise with everything I've got
Since death had all of it's power robbed
Then just like the grave
