Shh
They are the best and the worst you've created
Loving and hating and opinionated
Loners in basements and those congregated
Deliver me
Far from the peace, from ashore I was sinking
Deep in the ocean of thoughts they were thinking
Don't know what validation I was seeking
Deliver me from
People, people
When you said you could heal me from many things
Did you mean
People, people
Deliver me
'Cause I can't point 'em out
I won't say their names
I don't know the damage
Or which one to blame
It's just people, people
Deliver me
She was the reason I smiled in the morning
He took the last bit of joy I was storing
That's too much power for anything human
Deliver me from
People, people
I know you can heal me from many things
What about
People, people
Deliver me
'Cause I can't point 'em out
I won't say their names
I don't know the damage
Or which one to blame
It's just people, people
Deliver me, yeah
The hurt are hurting
And the broken are breaking (breaking)
And the ones who had their joy taken away
Are out here taking from other
People, people
People, people
Forgive these
People, people
Heal me from
People, people
Crazy
People, people
Trolling
People, people
Self-righteous
People, people
Entitled
People, people
Hating, lying (people, people)
Disrespectful, forgive me when I'm one of those (people, people)
People, people
Deliver me
