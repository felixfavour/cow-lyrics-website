From the world that presses in
Deliver us
From our faithlessness and from our fear
From our selfishness and sin
Deliver us, hosanna, Lord draw near
You are the lifeline
Through the tumult of this age
You are the lifeline
When the storms within us rage
You are the lifeline
You're the Master of the waves
You are the lifeline
The mighty God who saves
From all anxiousness and fright
Deliver us
From the enemy who would destroy
From the terrors of the night
Deliver us, hosanna, Lord bring joy
You are the lifeline
Through the tumult of this age
You are the lifeline
When the storms within us rage
You are the lifeline
You're the Master of the waves
You are the lifeline
The mighty God who saves
