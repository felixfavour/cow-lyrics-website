Troubles will be no more on the other shore
Peace and rest
Home at last
When we get over there
When we get over there
Oh how happy the day
When I say good bye to the troubles of this life
A city bright and fair
Where the streets are paved with gold
And they never grow old
He promised me a mansion there
Where they'll be no more worries and no more cares
And the joy that we'll share cannot compare
Oh what joy
Oh what peace
Oh what happiness
When we get over there
