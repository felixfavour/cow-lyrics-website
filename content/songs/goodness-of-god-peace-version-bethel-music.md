I love You, Lord, oh, Your mercy never fails me
And all my days, I've been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
All my life, You have been faithful
All my life, You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
I love Your voice, You have led me through the fire
In my darkest night, You are close like no other
I've known You as a father, I've known You as a friend
Oh, I have lived in the goodness of God, oh
And all my life, You have been faithful
All my life, You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So good
