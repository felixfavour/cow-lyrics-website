You are forever in my life
You see me through the seasons
Cover me with Your hand
And lead me in Your righteousness
[Pre-Chorus]
And I look to You
And I wait on You
I will sing to You, Lord
A hymn of love
For Your faithfulness to me
I'm carried in everlasting arms
You'll never let me go
Through it all
You are forever in my life
You see me through the seasons
Cover me with Your hand
And lead me in Your righteousness
[Pre-Chorus]
And I look to You
And I wait on You
