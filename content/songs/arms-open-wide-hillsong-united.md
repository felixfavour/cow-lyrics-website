Take my life I lay it down
At the cross where I am found
All I have I give to You oh God
Take my hands and make them clean
Keep my heart in purity
That I may walk in all You have for me
Oh oh oh oh
Here I stand, arms open wide
Oh oh oh oh
I am Yours, and You are mine
Take my moments and my days
Let each breath that I take
Be ever only for You oh God
Oh oh oh oh
Here I stand, arms open wide
Oh oh oh oh
I am Yours, and You are mine
Oh oh oh oh
Here I stand, arms open wide
Oh oh oh oh
I am Yours, and You are mine
