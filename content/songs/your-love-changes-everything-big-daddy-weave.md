My soul was a raging sea
Then  You reached down to me
Pulled  me up from the waves
Safe from the storm
I was an orphan child
Running  alone and wild
You  took this hopeless heart
And gave me a home
Your  love changes everything
Your grace covers all I've done
And I'm standing here today
All because of Your great love
I  see Your nail-scarred hands
I see Your open arms
You call me just as I am
'Cause Jesus that's who You are
Now nothing can separate
Nothing can stand against
The power that overcame the grave
Is giving me life that never ends
