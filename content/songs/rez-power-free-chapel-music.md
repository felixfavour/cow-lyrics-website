[Chorus]
Oh, clap your hands
All ye people
And shout unto God
With a voice of triumph, oh
With a voice of triumph, oh
You are the everlasting God
Shine Your light through us
For all the world to see, yeah
You are the hope of broken hearts
You overcame the grave
To save humanity
We're singing
Hallelujah, Jesus is alive
Come on
Oh, clap your hands
All ye people, hey
And shout unto God, yeah
Oh, clap your hands
All ye people
And shout unto God
With a voice of triumph, oh
With a voice of triumph, oh
