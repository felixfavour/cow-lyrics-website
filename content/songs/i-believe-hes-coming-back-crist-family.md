High upon a mountain, from where He ascended.
An angel of The Lord declared that it would be.
He said "Don't stand here grieving for the one that you see leaving.
In like manner He's coming back for you and me.
And I believe He's coming back like He said.
I believe that a trumpet's gonna sound so loud
One day it'll wake the dead.
In the twinkling of an eye,
He'll split the eastern sky.
And I believe that He's coming back like He said.
I believe the time is nearing,
We'll soon see His appearing.
Well this could be the hour, and this could be the day.
When the saints from every nation,
Gonna loose gravitation.
In the middle of the air be caught away.
And I believe that He's coming back like He said.
I believe that a trumpets gonna sound so loud,
One day it'll wake the dead.
In the twinkling of an eye,
He's gonna split the eastern sky.
And I believe that He's coming back like He said.
I believe that He's coming back like he said!
