Jesus bring glory to Your name
Jesus bring glory to Your name
Salvation, spring up from the ground
Lord, rend the heavens and come down
Seek the lost and heal the lame
Jesus, bring glory to Your name
Let all the prodigals run home
All of creation waits and groans
Lord, we've heard of Your great fame
Father, cause all to shout Your name
Salvation, spring up from the ground
Lord, rend the heavens and come down
Seek the lost and heal the lame
Jesus, bring glory to Your name
Let all the prodigals run home
All of creation waits and groans
Lord, we've heard of Your great fame
Father, cause all to shout Your name
Stir up our hearts, oh God
Open our spirits to awe who You are
Put a cry in us so deep inside
That we cannot find the words we need
We just weep and cry out to You
Salvation, spring up from the ground
Lord, rend the heavens and come down
Seek the lost and heal the lame
Jesus, bring glory to Your name
Let all the prodigals run home
All of creation waits and groans
Lord, we've heard of Your great fame
Father, cause all to shout Your name
Stir up our hearts, oh God
Stir up our hearts, oh God
Open our spirits to awe who You are
Put a cry in us so deep inside
That we cannot find the words we need
We just weep and cry out to You
We cry out to You
Salvation, spring up from the ground
Lord, rend the heavens and come down
Seek the lost and heal the lame
Jesus, bring glory to Your name
Let all the prodigals run home
All of creation waits and groans
Lord, we've heard of Your great fame
Father, cause all to shout Your name
Salvation, spring up from the ground
Lord, rend the heavens and come down
Seek the lost and heal the lame
Jesus, bring glory to Your name
Let all the prodigals run home
All of creation waits and groans
Lord, we've heard of Your great fame
Father, cause all to shout Your name
