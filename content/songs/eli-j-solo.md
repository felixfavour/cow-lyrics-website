Solo,
Remember say na for gutter you bin dey
Long ago time when things bin dey so rough
Remember say your trust in man bin fail
But I know say na God dey for your side
(Arhii)
Will-you Remember say you for die that day
Abi na you bring yourself come this world
You vex comot from church because dem wan give you solo you see
(Chorus)
Your Life no be your own
I wonder where you dey go
Me I dey tell you Solo
You no go fit go Solo
Your Life no be your own
I wonder where you dey go
Me I dey tell you Solo
You no go fit go Solo
(Arhhh x4)
Verse 2
Abeg no trust in your horses and chariot
If you dey think say na you try pass, you dey go the wrong (Chai)
If no b Jesus way, then na Soakaway
Meaning with time, everything go go down the drain
If nothing na who be the sun wey give you light
You forget say you no bin get Wetin you call your own
(Solo), you know say na him bin dey with you from yesterday
Yesterday when nobody bin know your name
Chorus
Your life be your own
I wonder where you dey go
Me I dey tell you Solo
You no go fit go Solo
Your life no be your own
I wonder where you dey go
Me I dey tell you Solo
You no go fit go Solo
Your life no be your own
I wonder where you dey go
Me I dey tell you Solo
(Whistle)
Jesus wan give you Solo
(hu.hu.hu-hu-hu-hu)
