Every time I come running
I find grace on repeat
You welcome me with open arms
No matter where I have been
Every time I surrender
Every time I fall
I find grace more precious than I did before
So I'm gonna lay my world down
Here at Your feet
Look to the heavens
For all I need
I'm gonna sing my heart out
Praise on repeat
To the God who's never given up on me
You're the mercy at midnight
You're the kindness of dawn
My hope in every waking hour
And the strength I lean on
Every time it comes to sundown
And the night sets in
Let my soul remember just how good You've been
And again and again
My heart will sing
I'm gonna lay my world down
Here at Your feet
Look to the heavens
For all I need
I'm gonna sing my heart out
Praise on repeat
To the God who's never given up on me
'Cause You're the God who's never given up on me
Grace upon grace
Morning by morning
Day after day will I sing
Praise upon praise
God be exalted
Over and over again
Oh, grace upon grace
Morning by morning
Day after day will I sing
Praise upon praise
God be exalted
Over and over again
Grace upon grace
Morning by morning
Day after day will I sing
Praise upon praise
God be exalted
Over and over again
I'm gonna lay my world down
Here at Your feet
Look to the heavens
For all I need
I'm gonna sing my heart out
Praise on repeat
To the God who's never given up on me
'Cause You're the God who's never given up on me
