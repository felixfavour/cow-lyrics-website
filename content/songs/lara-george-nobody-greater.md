Jesus lover of my soul
Your great love has made me whole
I can now declare
Nobody greater than You
The whole universe proclaims
Your Excellency reigns
You rule in all Your power
Nobody greater than You
Nobody greater than You
Nobody greater than You
Nobody greater than You
Oh my God
Nobody greater than You

Nobody greater than You
Jesus lover of my soul
Your great love has made me whole
I can now declare
Nobody greater than You
The whole universe proclaims
Your Excellency reigns
You rule in all Your power
Nobody greater than You
Nobody greater than You

Nobody greater than You
Oh my God
Nobody greater than You
