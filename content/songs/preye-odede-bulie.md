ti:Preye Odede - Bulie]
Eze ndi Eze
Idighi agbanwe agbanwe
If not for your grace
I would have been lost and gone
Eze ndi Eze
Ikariri Ihe anyi si na ibu
The reason I'm alive
Is just to worship you
From age to ages (Idighi agbanwe agbanwe)
You never never change
Chim o!
When I call on you (Idighi agharipu)
Ocean divider
Odighi onye dika gi
He's the king of all kings
Oh
Eze
When I think of all you've done for me oh God
My words won't be enough
To say I'm grateful
When I look around and see the beauty
My words won't be enough
To say you're wonderful
Lord I will never forget how you raised me up
I will never forget
How you wiped my tears
I will never forget
How you brought my feet back
Odighi onye dika
Idighi agbanwe agbanwe
Eze ndi eze
Idighi agbanwe agbanwe
If not for your grace
I would have been lost and gone
Eze ndi Eze
Ikariri Ihe anyi si na ibu
The reason I'm alive
Is just to worship you
Eze ndi eze
Idighi agbanwe agbanwe
If not for your grace
I would have been lost and gone
Eze ndi Eze
Ikariri Ihe anyi si na ibu
The reason I'm alive
Is just to worship you
From age to ages (Idighi agbanwe agbanwe)
You never never change
Chim o!
When I call on you (Idighi agharipu)
Ocean divider
Odighi onye dika gi
I'll lift you up
