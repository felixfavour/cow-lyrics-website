In the darkest night
When I couldn't see
I was sinkin' fast
When You rescued me
I felt a hand
And there You were
Nowhere else to turn
I was all alone
Kinda' lost my way
All my dreams were gone
Then I heard a voice
And there You were
I needed a touch from the Savior's hand
And that's just how the miracle began
I know I'll never be the same again
All I can say is
Thank You Jesus
Thank You Jesus
Thank You Jesus
Thank You Lord
When I think about
All You've done for me
Took away my fear
Filled my heart with peace
I'm grateful Lord
There You were
