I am Yours
Called by Your name
I bow down
To humble myself and pray
Father hear me
Father make it right
And use my generation to heal
The nations crying out
I won't delay
I won't hesitate
I will obey Your call
And abandon all to see
The power of God
Your glory revealed
My nation healed
Open up open up the heavens
Pour out healing rain
Open up open up the heavens
I want to see my nation healed
