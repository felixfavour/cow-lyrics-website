I rest my soul on Jesus
When the mountains shake
I put my trust in Jesus
The moment I awake
And when my soul is lost at sea
He will be my rock
My vision be in Christ alone
This grace is all we've got
His love is like the mighty ocean
His love for me will never stop
Oh, His arms are strong enough to carry me
Through it all, by the grace of God
So I, upon His shoulders
Safely brought this far
Helper of my helpless soul
The King of broken hearts
His love is like the mighty ocean
His love for me will never stop
Oh, His arms are strong enough to carry me
Through it all, by the grace of God
You are the passion of my life
Lord Jesus
You are the song within my soul
My strength
My hope
My all in all is You
Jesus, You
Thank You, Lord
When breath grows still and night draws near
I will not be afraid
I know the plans He has for me
Don't finish at my grave
His love is like the mighty ocean
His love for me will never stop
Oh, His arms are strong enough to carry me
Through it all, by the grace of God
Through it all, by the grace of God
By Your grace, I'm saved
