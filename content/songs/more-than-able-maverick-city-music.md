When did I start to forget
All of the great things you did
When did I throw away faith for the impossible
How did I start to believe
You weren't sufficient for me
Why do I talk myself out of seeing miracles
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do
Now I see all that I have
I've got my confidence back
I'll put my trust in the One who still does miracles
You do miracles
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do
