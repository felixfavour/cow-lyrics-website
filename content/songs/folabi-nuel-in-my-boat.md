even when I'm surrounded by the storm
I'll not be moved cos you're with me
And even when I'm surrounded by the fire
I'll not be shaken cos you're with me
b'cos I have gat you in my boat lord
every storm will cease.
I have gat you in my boat
gat you in in my boat.....
my storm is ceasing right now
and my joy is coming right now.
Jesus is right here with me ryt now.
my storm is ceasing right now
my storm is ceasing right now
",     ".
bcos I have got you.
