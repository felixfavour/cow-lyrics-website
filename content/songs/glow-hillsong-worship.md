Lost and stranded
Empty handed
Broken down and all alone
Your mercy, it entered
Into darkness
And enfolded us in love
Pre-Chorus:
We give You all we are
For the glory of Your name
We give all we are
For Your praise
Just a glimmer
Of Your glory
And the Earth falls to it?s knees
You leveln the mountains
With a whisper
And You calm the raging seas
Pre-Chorus:
We give You all we are
For the glory of Your name
We give all we are
For Your praise
