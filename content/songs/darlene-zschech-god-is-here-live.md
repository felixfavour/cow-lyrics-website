Open our eyes, Lord
We want to see You
Open our hearts, Lord
We want to know You
Open our ears, Lord
We need to hear You

He is able
We draw near
To see Jesus face to face
God is here

He is faithful
We draw near to see Jesus
Oh Jesus be revealed
Open the gates, Lord
Reveal Your glory
Open the nations
Establish Your Kingdom
Open the Heavens
Pour out Your Spirit

We draw near
To see Jesus face to face
