God yes you did, you gave it
yes you did, you gave it
Yes you did, you shed it
yes you did, you gave it
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I've been
They ask about the power
I've been walking in
And what is being saved now
And why I'm not afraid
And why my mind is made up
And why it just won't change
Chorus;
Cause you did, you gave it
Your Everlasting life
Ohhhh you gave to me
Your Everlasting life
ohhhh way back then you thought of me
Your Everlasting life
yes you did, you gave it
Your Everlasting life
Strength in my weakness
Banner in the war
Anchor in the ocean
Shelter in the storm
Lord you justified me
And you called me  friend
You wrote me in your story
The one that never ends
Chorus;
yes you did, you gave it
Your Everlasting life
yes you did, you gave it
Your Everlasting life
ohhhh yes you did, you thought of me yhhh
Your Everlasting life
I'm so glad that you shed it yeahhh
Your Everlasting life
 And we keep going as I think of the Love ,the sacrifice and the victory you gave
Your Everlasting life
yeahhh I'm so glad you thought of me when
Your Everlasting life
Not mumbling a word when (when) you stood up there for me yh
Your Everlasting life
Eyyyy Yes you did, you gave
Your Everlasting life
(Hallelujah!!! ) Hallelujah 3
yes you did, you gave it
Your Everlasting life
yes you did, you gave it
Your Everlasting life
ohhhh, you gave it
Your Everlasting life
Followed me,set me free oh yeah (gave it)
Your Everlasting life
.....
Your Everlasting life
