I love You, Lord
For Your mercy never fails me
All my days, I've been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

'Cause all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

And I will not be silent
I will always worship You
As long as I am breathing
I will always worship You

Here's my worship
All of my worship 
Receive my worship
All of my worship

⁠You are the Mighty God
The Great I Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You are the Mighty God
The Great I Am
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Iwo lagbara 
atobiju
Hallelujah ,hallelujah 

Afope F’Olorun, lokan ati lohun wa,

Gbat’a wa l’omowo, On na l’o ntoju wa
O si nf’ebun ife, se ‘toju wa sibe.

I've never seen this kind God before
Wonder, wonder
I've never seen this kind God before
Wonder, wonder
I've never seen this kind God before
Wonder, wonder
I've never seen this kind God before
Wonder, wonder

Jesus, nawa oh, na waya oh
Jesus, nawa oh, na waya oh
Jesus, nawa oh, na waya oh

I will never be ungrateful to you Lord.
I will never be ungrateful to you Lord.
I will never be ungrateful to you Lord.
I will never be ungrateful to you Lord.
I will never be ungrateful to you Lord.
