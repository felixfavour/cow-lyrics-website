(Come on we sing together)
Precious blood has left me forgiven
Pure like the whitest of snow
Powerful to make sin and shame retreat
This covenant is making me whole
(Come on we're gonna sing that again, the precious blood)
Precious blood has left me forgiven (You sing it out)
Pure like the whitest of snow (Remind yourself)
It's powerful to make sin and shame retreat
This covenant is making me wholе
So I will rise and lift my head
For by His mercy my lifе was spared
The highest name has set me free
Because of Jesus, my heart is clean
Purify my heart in Your presence (Even now, God)
Teach me to discover the joy
Of holiness that forms as You draw me close
In You what was lost is restored (Come on you sing it out)
So I will rise and lift my head (What a gift it is)
For by His mercy my life was spared
The highest name has set me free
Because of Jesus, my heart is clean (So I will rise)
