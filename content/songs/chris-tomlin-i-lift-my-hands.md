Verse1
Be still there is healer
his love is deeper than the seas
his Mercy is unfailling
his arms a fortress for the weak
let faith arise,let faith arise
chorus
I lift my hands to believe again,u r my refuse u r my strength
as I pour out my heart
these things I remember me
u r faithful God forever
Verse2
Be still there is a river
that flows from Calvary stream
a fountain for the thirsty
ur grace that washes over me
let faith arise,let faith arise
back to chorus
Bridge
let faith arise,let faith arise
open my eyes,open my eyes
let faith arise,let faith arise
open my eyes,open my eyes
back to chorus
