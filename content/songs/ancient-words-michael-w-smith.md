Holy words long preserved
For our walk in this world
They resound with God's own heart
Oh, let the ancient words impart
Words of life, words of hope
Give us strength, help us cope
In this world, where e'er we roam
Ancient words will guide us home
Ancient words ever true
Changing me and changing you
We have come with open hearts
Oh, let the ancient words impart
Holy words of our faith
Handed down to this age
Came to us through sacrifice
Oh, heed the faithful words of Christ
Holy words long preserved
For our walk in this world
They resound with God's own heart
Oh, let the ancient words impart
