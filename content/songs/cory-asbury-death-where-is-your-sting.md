For God so loved the world
He gave his son
To bear the weight of sin
He bled for us
From heaven's highest place
He took a fall
And there was just one life
Laid down for all
Death, where is your sting?
Grave, where is your victory?
He's alive, He's alive
He's risen
Behold the vacant tomb
That held our Lord
That grave became the stage
For Heaven's glory
And behold the risen King
In open skies
He is the Resurrection
He is the life
Death, where is your sting?
Grave, where is your victory?
He's alive, He's alive
He's risen
No weapon formed against us will prosper
The gates of hell won't stand
Your church will rise from glory to glory
In the name of Jesus
No weapon formed against us will prosper
The gates of hell won't stand
Your church will rise from glory to glory
In the name of Jesus
Death, where is your sting?
Grave, where is your victory?
He's alive, He's alive
He's risen
Death, where is your sting?
Grave, where is your victory?
He's alive, He's alive
He's risen
