The pages of my life tell of Your Goodness
Every chapter of my story show how You led me, Lord
I'm the handwriting of mercy by the Finger of the Lord
This is The Finger of The Lord, eii
You've been right here beside me
Through the fire, through the rain
I didn't burn, I didn't drown
'cause you were right by my side
I am a living testimony of the Goodness of the Lord, eii
This is The Doing of The Lord
What shall I render in deed, what shall I render?
What shall I rеnder to You, what shall I render?
Sɛ ɛnyɛ Nyamе na ɛwɔ mafa aa, anka ɛnyɛ oo
(Had it not been the Lord on my side, where would I be?)
Ɛnyɛ Nyame na ɛhu me mmɔbɔ aa (Had the Lord not shown me mercy)
Ɛnyɛ Nyame na ɛwɔ mafa aa (Had it not been the Lord on my side)
Ɛnyɛ Nyame na ɔyɛ m'adom (Had it not been the Grace of God)
This is... This is The Doing of The Lord
What shall I render in deed, what shall I render?
What shall I render to You, what shall I render?
