Are you looking for someone to be gentle
With your broken heart, your shattered dreams?
Are you searching for someone who'll be faithful
To you no matter what life brings?
Well I know the Maker of the storm, the sunrise;
He is both the Lion and the Lamb
He is strong enough to shake all earth and heaven
Yet meek enough to take me as I am
He says..
Come unto me all who are weary
And I will give you rest
Bring what hurts, bring your scars
Bring the load that you carry
And I will give you rest
Are the clouds above your head oh so heavy
Bursting with showers of despair?
Do you struggle under more than you can carry?
Has life given more than you can bear?
Would you like to trade your failures in for victories?
Like piles of ashes in for piles of gold
Can you fall down like a child who is helpless
So He can pick you up and make you whole?
He says....
