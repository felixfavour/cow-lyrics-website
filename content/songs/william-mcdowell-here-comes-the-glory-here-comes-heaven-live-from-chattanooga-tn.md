There's a holy expectation
Rising in the room
With great anticipation
We know our God will move
Faith is rising
Hearts are burning
As You're drawing near
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
There's a holy expectation
Rising in the room
With great anticipation
We know our God will move
Faith is rising
Hearts are burning
As You're drawing near
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
Here comes the glory
Here comes the glory
Here comes the glory
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Lift up your heads
Oh ye ancient doors
Here comes, here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory
Here comes the glory
Here comes Jesus
Lift up your heads
Oh ye gates
And be lifted up ye everlasting doors
And the King, The king of glory
He shall come in
He shall come in
Who is this king of glory
He's the Lord strong and mighty
He's the Lord mighty in battle
And here He comes
Here He comes
Here He comes
Here comes Heaven
Here comes Heaven
Sweeping in the room
Here comes Heaven
Here comes Heaven
Here comes healing
Here comes healing
Here comes freedom
Here comes freedom
Here comes Heaven
Here comes healing
Here comes freedom
Here comes Jesus
Here comes Jesus
Here comes Jesus
Here comes Jesus
Here comes Jesus
Here comes Jesus
Here comes Jesus
Here comes Jesus
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
