I met this fine chic for show way I go
She told me she's liking the way that I flow
ThAt she would like to be just like me when she grows
And we both had a laugh
It was clearly a Joke
Cos she was in her late twenties
But the matter way she carry plenty
I saw through the smiles
She was dying in pains
She's thinking of suicide
She no do again
Oya hold it
Hold it
I know just what you're thinking
But this God I serve that's in heaven
E go answer you if you call am
Oya hold it
Hold it
I know just what you're thinking
But this God You serve that's in heaven
E go answer you if you call am
ChAle make you wait first
You for pray first
If you never tell God
E no fit make sense
E be Jehovah way Dey bless handwork
Way Dey make am work
One touch e go make sense
ChAle make you wait first
You for pray first
If you never tell God
E no fit make sense
E be Jehovah way Dey bless handwork
Way Dey make am work
One touch e go make sense
Tell God
(Ireti E Ole Pe)
ChAle make you tell God
(Ireti E Ole Pe)
I say make you tell God
(Ireti E Ole Pe)
Master make you tell God

But this God I serve that's in heaven
E go answer you if you call am
Oya hold it

But this God You serve that's in heaven
E go answer you if you call am
