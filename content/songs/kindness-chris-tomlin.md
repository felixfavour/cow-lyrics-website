[x2]
Open up the skies of mercy
And rain down the cleansing flood
Healing waters rise around us
Hear our cries Lord let them rise
It's Your kindness Lord
That leads us to repentance
Your favor, Lord, is our desire
It's Your beauty, Lord
That makes us stand in silence
Your love
Your love
Is better than life
We can feel
Your mercy falling
You are turning our hearts back again
Hear our praises rise to heaven
Draw us near Lord
Meet us here
[x2]
