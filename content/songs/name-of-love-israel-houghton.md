I have a friend he likes to win
Looks at life as one big strategy
He's chasing dreams
But there's a hole in his soul
And he searches for significance
In emptiness
But
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
I have a friend she's super thin
She thinks that life's about appearances
Images she sees on screen
The types of hair the clothes she wears
Reflect the way she feels about herself
Compared to someone else
But I say
SO COME IN THE NAME OF LOVE
IN THE NAME OF LOVE
I have a friend my closest friend
He sees your life as something wonderful
Worth dying for
More than enough this kind of love
Living water if you drink it first
You'll never thirst again
And like I said
Humanity humanity
Is reaching out for something real
History our history
Is crying out for us to feel
That all we need yeah all we need
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
