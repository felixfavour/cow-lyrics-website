All my life-time plans
I got 'em in my hands
Balancing my fate upon a wire
Got to let it go
Everywhere I turn I see
There's nowhere left to go
All my dreams are far
Too much for me to hold
Still I hate to drop them
Weren't they from you?
What did I do?
You are the one that can see
Into the heart of me
Am I really giving up tomorrow?
Got, got, got to let it go
This is gonna hurt a little
Still it's right I know
Got to let it --
Even though I fear
Too much of me might show
I can't wait any longer for it
I've had enough!
I'll give it up!
Lord, here's my heart
I've been keeping it from you
And I got to let it go
Holding on just breaks me, worry
Got to let it go
Come and take it from me, hurry
Got to let it go
Go to let it -- got to let it go
Got to give up all of my control!
