I Started Out To Win This Race,
To Serve The Lord,
To Look Upon His Face.
But The Ways Been Long,
And The Way’s Been Rough.
But There’s One Thing For Sure,
I’ve Got My Mind Made Up.

I’ve Got My Foot On The Rock,
And My Mind’s Made Up.
Though I Walk Through The Lowly Valley,
Though I Drink From The Bitter Cup.
When The Devil Comes Knocking,
Showing Me An Easy Way.
I Stand Right Square On My Feet,
I Throw My Head In The Air,
I Look Him Square In The Eye,
I Say My Foot’s On The Rock,
And My Mind’s Made Up.

The Devil He Will Tempt You,
And Pull You Away With Strife.
He’ll Make You Sick In Body,
Even Try To Take Your Life.
Just Put Your Trust In Jesus,
And Say Lord I’ve Had Enough.
The Lord Will Say Move On Satan,
He’s Got His Mind Made Up.

I’ve Got My Foot On The Rock,
And My Mind’s Made Up.
Though I Walk Through The Lowly Valley,
Though I Drink From The Bitter Cup.
When The Devil Comes Knocking,
Showing Me An Easy Way.
I Stand Right Square On My Feet,
I Throw My Head In The Air,
I Look Him Square In The Eye,
I Say My Foot’s On The Rock,
And My Mind’s Made Up.

Now Job Was A Man,
Who Was Gentle In Every Way.
The Devil Took His Family,
He Lay Sick Both Night And Day.
His Wife She Came Saying,
Curse God You’ve Had Enough.
He Said You Talk Like A Foolish Woman,
I’ve Got My Mind Made Up.

I’ve Got My Foot On The Rock,
And My Mind’s Made Up.
Though I Walk Through The Lowly Valley,
Though I Drink From The Bitter Cup.
When The Devil Comes Knocking,
Showing Me An Easy Way.
I Stand Right Square On My Feet,
I Throw My Head In The Air,
I Look Him Square In The Eye,
I Say My Foot’s On The Rock,
And My Mind’s Made Up.
