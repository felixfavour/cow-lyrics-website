At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light
And the burden of my soul rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
Now no longer I but Christ in me
I will run to the cross
Where You opened up my eyes
I will sing of the love that saved me
I will bow in the place
Where Your death became my life
I will run, I will run to the cross
O how endless the hope
O how empty the grave
And the joy of a stone rolled away
It is there by grace I am raised to life
Now no longer I but Christ in me
I will run to the cross
Where You opened up my eyes
I will sing of the love that saved me
I will bow in the place
Where Your death became my life
I will run, I will run to the cross
Yes, I will run, I will run to the cross
It is no longer I
It is Christ who lives in me
Christ who lives in me
Christ who lives in me
[x4]
It's Christ
It is no longer I
It is Christ who lives in me
Christ who lives in me
Christ who lives in me
[x2]
It's Christ, it's Christ
It is no longer I
It is Christ who lives in me
Christ who lives in me
Christ who lives in me
[x2]
At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light
And the burden of my soul rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
Now no longer I but Christ in me
