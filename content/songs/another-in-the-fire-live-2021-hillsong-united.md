[Intro]
If ever a song
Was meant for this room, this moment
This song was written in New York City for New York City
For anyone who's in the middle of the fight of your life
For anyone who's in the middle of a storm
For anybody who's in the season where you can't see a way out
For anyone who's in the season where you might feel alone, I wanna promise you
There is one who never leaves or forsakes us
He is with you in every moment, there is hope for you
And this song is our declaration of faith
That the God who was faithful back then
Is faithful now and will be faithful to the end, in Jesus' name, amen
Come on, Chris
There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me
There is another in the fire
