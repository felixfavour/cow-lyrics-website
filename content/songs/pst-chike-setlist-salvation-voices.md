*Song list...* 


 *Up tempo* 

How Great is Our God 
Sing with me how great is our God 
And all will sing how great 
How great is our God 

Nobody's great, Nobody's great 
Nobody's greater than You

You are great yes You are 
Holy one 
You walked upon the seas , you raised the dead 
You reign in Majesty, Mighty one 
Everything written about you is great

What a Mighty God we serve 
What a Mighty God, we serve
Heaven and Earth adore Him 
Angels bow before Him 
What a Mighty God we serve! 

Now unto the Lamb upon the Throne 
We raise a Sound We raise a Sound
For He is worthy 
To receive glory honor and praise 
Now unto the Lamb upon the Throne 
We raise a Sound We raise a Sound
