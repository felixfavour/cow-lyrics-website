I've come to tell you 'bout Jesus Christ
How He walked on the water
Calmed the raging sea
King of David, seed of Abraham
Mighty Rose of Sharon
A meek and humble Lamb
Chorus:
Such a price He came to pay
Tell me what, what more can I say
You asked me how I know Him
How I know this Man;
He's a personal friend of mine
Children, He's a personal friend of mine
Verse
Chorus
Bridge:
Oh well, He made a way out of no way
Soothe my doubts and fears
Wiped away my tears
When I need Him, He's always near
Ready, willing, and able
To comfort and to cheer
Chorus
Bridge

Vamp 1:
It ain't nobody to me like like Him
No, no, nobody
It ain't nobody to me like like Him
No, no, nobody
Vamp 2:
Personal friend of mine
Ending:
It ain't nobody to me like like Him
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, nobody
