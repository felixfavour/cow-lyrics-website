I understand my purpose and what I'm here to do
My responsibility is that through me...
The world see you
Pre-chorus:
Let my life reflect You;
Let Your glory flow through
Here's my heart; I surrender all to You
Lord, be pleased in all I do
Chorus:
I will lift my hands; I will worship
I will honor You;
I will lift my voice in adoration
That's what I was created to do
I discovered my passion;
My identity has been revealed
You desire me to worship
And I long for You, oh God, to be revealed
(Pre-chorus - Chorus 2x)
Ending (worship leader ad lib):
I will, I will... (4x)
