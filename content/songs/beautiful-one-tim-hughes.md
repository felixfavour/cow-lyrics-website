Wonderful, so wonderful, is Your unfailing love
Your cross has spoken mercy over me
No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no heart could fully know
How glorious, how beautiful You are

Beautiful One, I love
Beautiful One, I adore
Beautiful One, my soul must sing!

My soul, my soul must sing
My soul, my soul must sing
My soul, my soul must sing
Beautiful one!

Powerful, so powerful, Your glory fills the skies
Your mighty works displayed for all to see
The beauty of Your majesty awakes my heart to sing
How marvellous, how wonderful You are

You've opened my hearts to wonders anew
You've captured my heart with this love
'Cause nothing on earth is as beautiful as You
Jesus
