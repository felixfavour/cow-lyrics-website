Oh, troubled Messiah
You prayed through the night
Unbearable sorrow
The world on Your mind
Betrayed by the kiss of a friend, You were taken
By Your own free will
Rejected and disowned by those You came to heal
Stripped of Your clothes, You were mocked, You were beaten
Made a King of fools
A crown of sorrow driven deep into Your brow
Yet You made no sound
[Post-Chorus]
What You went through to love me
I'll never understand
What blows my mind away is
You love me as I am
Thеy called for Barabbas
A King for a thief
Parading Your kindness
Likе rags through the streets
