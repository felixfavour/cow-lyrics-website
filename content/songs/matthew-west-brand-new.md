When you close your eyes, do you go back there
To a bended knee and a "Lord, I need you" whispered prayer?
Remember the moment you let Jesus in
Would you give anything to go back there again?
You feel like a million mistakes and a million miles
Away from the first time faith of a child
But oh, I want you to know
He's making you new
He's making you new
He's healing your heart right where you are
If only you knew
He's lifting your shame
He's changing your name
And when you look back
The only thing that you'll see is His grace
Has been making you brand new
He is making you brand new
When it just doesn't feel like the old you is gone
The shame keeps telling your heart that you should be further along
You can fix your eyes now on the truth you know
That you are held by the hands of a savior that won't let go
He's making you new
He's making you new
He's healing your heart right where you are
If only you knew
He's lifting your shame
He's changing your name
And when you look back
The only thing that you'll see is His grace
Has been making you brand new
He is making you brand new
Anyone in Christ is now a new creation
Every day you're closer to the you He's making
So take one last look back and see your past erasing
You're not who you were, that's over and done
So lift up your eyes to the one
Who's making you new
He's making you new
He's healing your heart right where you are
If only you knew
He's lifting your shame
He's changing your name
And when you look back
The only thing that you'll see is His grace
Has been making you brand new
He is making you brand new
Yes, He is making you brand new
