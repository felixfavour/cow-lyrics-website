Not going back, I'm moving ahead
I'm here to declare to you my past is over, I'm in You
All things are made new surrendered my life to Christ
I'm moving, moving forward
What a moment You have brought me to
Such a freedom I have found in You
You're the Healer who makes all things new
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Not going back, I'm moving ahead
I'm here to declare to you my past is over, I'm in You
All things are made new surrendered my life to Christ
I'm moving, moving forward
You have risen with all power in Your hands
You have given me a second chance
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Not going back moving ahead
I'm here to declare to you my past is over I'm in You
All things are made new surrendered my life to Christ
I'm moving
Not going back, moving ahead
I'm here to declare to you my past is over I'm in You
All things are made new surrendered my life to Christ
I'm moving, moving forward
