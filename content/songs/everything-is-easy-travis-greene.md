If you can walk on water
Then you can walk on air
If you're a living martyr
Then you surpassed all flesh
And if you can heal the blind
Then you can see forever
Tell the sun to shine
Control the waging weather
If you can take a little food
And feed a lot of men
And you can take a dying fool
And give him life again
If you can do all this
Then this world belongs to you
If you can still love me
There is nothing that you can't do
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
Everything is easy for you
Because you're God
