Persecuted not abandoned
Struck down not destroyed
We are more than overcomers
Hard-pressed but not crushed
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh Lord our Lord
We look to You
Our hope our strength
We trust in You
Heaven is open
Blessings are falling over us
Creation is groaning
For sons and daughters to rise up
We're chasing Your glory
We're chasing Your glory
[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh
You're changing the story
We'll be transformed
From glory to glory
