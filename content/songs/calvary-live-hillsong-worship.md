The Saviour alone carried the cross
For all of my debts, He paid the cost
Salvation complete, now forever I'm free
Calvary covers it all
Calvary covers it all
My sin and shame, don't count anymore
All praise to the One, who has ransomed my soul
Calvary covers it all
No power on earth, not even the grave
Can separate us, from mercy and grace
He is faithful to save, oh His blood never fails
Calvary covers it all
Calvary covers it all
My sin and shame, don't count anymore
All praise to the One, who has ransomed my soul
Calvary covers it all
[Bridge]
No one but Jesus
Can make us pure as snow
We stand in Your freedom
Calvary covers it all
