DEAREST SHEPHERD  Eli-J & LoveWorld Singers
VERSE 1
Lord, You're our dearest shepherd
And so we shall not want
Lord, You're the strength of our lives
Of whom shall we be afraid?
You gave us a Kingdom
That cannot be moved
We Your saints, thank You, Lord
For the conquests in Your name
CHORUS
Lord God, You are with us
We will not be dismayed
Lord Jesus, we are the fruits
And splendour of Your deeds
Master, You kept Your word
Just as You said, You would
All that we would desire
You willed it all to us
VERSE 2
We're not afraid of what's before us
The life we now live is by faith
And knowing You have gone before us
To make the crooked places straight
Every day is a glorious day
The glory we have is not of this world
For the world and its lust will pass away
But we won't fade away
OUTRO
(All we've known)
(Is Your voice)
(And there's not been a feeble one through the years)
(All because)
Lord, You're our dearest shepherd
