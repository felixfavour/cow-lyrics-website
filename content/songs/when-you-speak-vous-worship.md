I hear Your voice
Even in the distance
Even in the silence
Even in the static
I see You move
Even in the dark night
Even in the half-light
Even in the stillness
[Pre-Chorus]
And after the fire, and after the wind
When chaos subsides, I listen again
And after the earth shakes, You're calling me in
A voice in the quiet, a whisper within

When You speak, I am still
I believe You are near
Speak to me, draw me in
Where You are, I'll remain
I feel Your love
Even in the heartache
Even though my heart breaks
Even then Your word stays
I know You're here
Even when I'm broken
Even when I'm hopeless
I know where my hope is

When You speak, I am still
I believe You are near
Speak to me, Lord, draw me in
Where You are, I'll remain
[Spontaneous]
Ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause there is joy in Your presence
There is peace in Your presence, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
[Bridge]
There's hope when I'm hopeless
There's light in the darkest hour
There's peace when I'm restless
It's not over, it's not over
There's grace when I'm anxious
There's joy when I'm brokenhearted
There's power in Jesus
It's not over, it's not over
There's hope when I'm hopeless
There's light in the darkest hour
There's peace when I'm restless
It's not over, it's not over
There's grace when I'm anxious
There's joy when I'm brokenhearted
There's power in Jesus
It's not over, it's not over
There's hope when I'm hopeless
There's light in the darkest hour
There's peace when I'm restless
It's not over, it's not over
There's grace when I'm anxious
There's joy when I'm brokenhearted
There's power in Jesus
It's not over, it's not over
(It's not over)
It's not over, it's not over

When You speak, oh, I am still
I believe You are near
Speak to me, draw me in
Where You are, I'll remain

[Outro]
There's hope when I'm hopeless
There's light in the darkest hour
There's peace when I'm restless
It's not over, it's not over
There's grace when I'm anxious
There's joy when I'm brokenhearted
There's power in Jesus
It's not over, it's not over
There's hope when I'm hopeless
There's light in the darkest hour
There's peace when I'm restless
It's not over, it's not over
There's grace when I'm anxious
There's joy when I'm brokenhearted
There's power in Jesus
It's not over, it's not over
It's not over, it's not over
It's not over, it's not over
