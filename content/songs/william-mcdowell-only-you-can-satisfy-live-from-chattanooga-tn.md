Only You Can Satisfy"
(feat. Chris Lawson)
Only You can satisfy my heart
Only You can satisfy my soul
Only You can satisfy my heart
Jesus, Jesus
Only You can satisfy my heart
Only You can satisfy my soul
Only You can satisfy my heart
Jesus, Jesus
Only You can satisfy my heart
Only You can satisfy my soul
Only You can satisfy my heart
Jesus, Jesus
If I take what the world has offered
I'll have to come again, again and again
With just one drink of his living water
I'll never thirst again, I'll never thirst again
Only You can satisfy my heart
Only You can satisfy my soul
Only You can satisfy my heart
Jesus, Jesus
Only You can satisfy my heart
Only You can satisfy my soul
Only You can satisfy my heart
Jesus, Jesus
Only You can satisfy my heart
Only You can satisfy my soul
Only You can satisfy my heart
Jesus, Jesus
If I take what the world has offered
I'll have to come again, again and again
Just one drink of his living water
I'll never thirst again, I'll never thirst again
Jacob's well will never do
So I will draw from You
This old world will never do
So I will draw from You
Jacob's well will never do
So I will draw from You
This old world will never do
So I will draw from You
Jacob's well will never do
So I will draw from You
This old world will never do
So I will draw from You
Jacob's well will never do
So I will draw from You
This old world will never do
So I will draw from You
