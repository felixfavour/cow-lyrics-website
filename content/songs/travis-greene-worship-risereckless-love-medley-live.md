from here till death
worship is filling the atmosphere
but now and then
don't turn your love will never end
and day and night
as we bow down
our praises will rise
inside and out
all that I am will shout
let my worship rise
but like a sweet perfume
I'll pour my love my love all over you
let my worship rise
but like a sweet perfume
I'll pour my love my love all over you
all over you+3
oh the overwhelming never ending reckless love of God
oh it chases me down fights till am found leave the ninety nine
I couldn't earn it
I don't deserve it
still u give yourself away
oh the overwhelming never ending reckless love of God
no shadow u won't light up
mountain u won't climb up
coming after me
no wall u won't kick down lie u won't tear down coming after me
no Shadow you won't light up
mountain you won't climb up coming after me
no wall you won't kick down
lie you won't tear down coming after me
oh the overwhelming never ending reckless love of God
oh it chases me down fights till am found leave the ninety nine
I couldn't earn
I don't deserve it still u give urself away
oh the overwhelming never ending reckless love of God
