I know you’re tired from the nights that left you broken
I know you hold onto the days they keep you going
I know you’re fighting just to keep your smile together
But child it's okay to cry
So when the tears come
Don’t try and stop them
You can let them out just let them fall
No you’re not breaking
Though your heart is aching
Don’t have to say a word just let them talk
We’re only human and life can be overwhelming
And it’s confusing to have faith when you’re hurting
So don’t be sorry for the questions that you’re facing
Just be still and know He’ll meet you therе
He hears
He knows
Hе’s near
He’s close
