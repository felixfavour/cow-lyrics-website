The cry you would cry when the saint have gone,cry it now when the saint are still around
The shout you would shout when you heard that the saint have gone Ehnn,shout it now when the saint are still around
After rapture there would be no more mercy this is the time to ask for those mercy when the saint are still around,mercy will not be available when the saint have gone,grace will not be available when the saint have gone
Mercy and grace will not be available when the saint have gone. Repentance is now when the saint are still around, repentance is now when the saint are still in the world this is the time to serving in truth and spirit be conscious of eternity don't leave your life anyhow ooo heaven is real, hell is real come to Jesus today
Seek him when he can be found tomorrow might be too late oooo he is knocking at the door of your heart let him in he is waiting for you.
Remember he would not wait for ever he is available now ooooo let him in he is waiting for you .
