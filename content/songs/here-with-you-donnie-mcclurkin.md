You bring the sunshine that brightens up my day
You hold the key that fits my heart, I'll never worry
I'll cast on you all of my cares
As the future unfolds, I know you'll be there
So I want to spend tomorrow here with you
There's no one else beside you who can love me the way you do
No one else knows my future or cares for me like you do
So I want to spend my tomorrows right here with you, right here with you
You make me happy, you bring me joy
Your love's the light that lights my way
With you beside me, I can conquer everything
I can face anything as long as you're here
I want to spend tomorrow here with you
There's no one else beside you who can love me the way you do
No one else knows my future or cares for me like you do
So I want to spend my tomorrows right here with you
The road before me is filled with winding turns
(Winding turns)
I need your light to guide my way, I won't last one day
(Not one day without you)
I won't last one day
(Not one day without you)
I won't last one day without you
