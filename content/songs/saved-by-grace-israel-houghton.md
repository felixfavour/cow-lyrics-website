Where would I be without Your grace?
I'd be lost without Your grace
How could I live without Your grace?
The life that I have is by Your grace
I am free, I'm forgiven
By Your work at Calvary
You gave me a life worth living
Now the chains are broken, chains are broken
I am saved by grace
Love abounding, mercy found me
I am saved by grace, yeah
And I have life and it's only by Your grace, oh, oh yeah
It's only by Your grace, oh, oh
Where would I be without Your grace?
I'd be lost without Your grace
How could I live without Your grace?
The life that I have is by Your grace
I am free, I'm forgiven
By Your work at Calvary
You gave me a life worth living
Now the chains are broken, chains are broken
Chains are broken
