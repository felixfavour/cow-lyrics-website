On the day, that death surrendered
To the mighty cross of Jesus Christ
The earth would shake, beneath the weight
Of darkened skies
On His brow, a crown of sorrow
For a King whose weakness was our strength
No word He spoke, His love was shown
For all to see
O the cross of Jesus Christ
Is the reason I'm alive
For His blood, has set me free
It will never lose, its power for me!
Now the dawn, of resurrection
Floods the night, as hope prevails to shine
Salvation wakes, our chains to break
And we arise!
O the cross of Jesus Christ
Is the reason I'm alive
For His blood, has set me free
It will never lose, its power for me!..
