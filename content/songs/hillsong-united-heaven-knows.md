hold my heart don't let it bleed no more
sometimes forgiveness is like a man at war
God only knows why love is worth the fall
maybe that's what makes it love
maybe that's what makes it love
I can hear it now the everlasting sound
roaring like a lion deep within me
and I won't hold it long I wasn't made that strong
sweet surrender hold my heart and not let go
I'm letting go
and heaven knows
I love you so
hold my heart don't let it break like fear
sometimes a moment feels like a thousand years
God only knows why love is drenched in tears
maybe that's what makes it love
maybe that's what makes it love
I can hear it now the everlasting sound
roaring like a lion deep within me
I won't hold it long I wasn't made that strong
sweet surrender hold my heart and not let go
I'm letting go
and heaven knows
I love you so
then sings my soul
then sings my soul
how great your love is
how great your love is
then sings my soul
then sings my soul
how great your love is
how great your love is
