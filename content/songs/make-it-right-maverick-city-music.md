[Intro: Dante Bowe]
Alright, alright, alright
I remember when sin was sin
And I remember when wrong was wrong
And I remember when we all fell short
And got back up much quicker than before
[Chorus: Dante Bowe & Jekalyn Carr]
Well, I'm praying that You open our eyes (Ayy)
Praying that You open our eyes again (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Father, please open our eyes (Oh, yeah)
Father, please open our eyes again (Yeah)
[Interlude: Todd Dulaney]
Woah, na-na
Hey, hеy, hey, hey, hey, hеy, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, na-na-na-na-na-na
I remember when the left was left, yeah
Said I remember when we had respect, ooh-na-na-na-na
I remember when my mother said, "No"It's exactly what she meant and then she followed up and said, "Because I told you so" (Hey)
