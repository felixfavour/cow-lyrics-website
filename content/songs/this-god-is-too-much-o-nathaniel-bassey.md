I know a God who's merciful and kind
Faithful and gracious

I'm the apple of his eyes
The thought that fills his heart every morning noon and night

He loved me when I didn't care
And was patient til I came running back into his arms

Look how he turned my life around
Made me a shining star
His glory to reveal

I will worship him forever
Love him forever because
This God is too good oh

I will worship him forever
Love him forever because
This God is too good oh

Don't look too far to see how good he is
Just look at me 
He took me from the miry clay
Set my feet upon the rock I'm standing in his righteousness

HE took away my sin and shame
Gave me a brand new name a brand new name
His beloved and the redeemed

Look how he turned my life around turned my life around
Made me a shinning light
His glory to reveal


This God is so good oh

Jesus you're too good oh

Jesus you're too much oh

This grace is too much oh

His love is too deep oh
