We'll go sweepin' through the city
Where thy captain has gone before
Someday we're gonna sit down
By the banks of the river
I won't be back
I won't be back
I won't be back
No more, no more, no more
We'll go sweepin' through the city
Where thy captain has gone before
Someday we're gonna sit down
By the banks of the river
I won't be back
I won't be back
I won't be back
No more, no more, no more
Blessed are the pure in heart
For they'll go (sweepin' through the city)
Blessed are those that mourn
For they'll go (sweepin' through the city)
Blessed are the poor in spirit
For they'll go (sweepin' through the city)
Blessed are the peacemakers
