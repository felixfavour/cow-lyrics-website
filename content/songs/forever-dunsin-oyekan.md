There's no better way to spend my life
No better way to spend my time
Forever it's Your presence I'll chase
Everything else proceeds from it

There's no better way to spend my life
No better way to spend my time
Forever it's Your presence I'll chase
Everything else proceeds from here

I'll forever sing in Your presence
I'll forever sing in Your presence
I'll forever, I'll forever
I'll forever sing in Your presence

Everybody say
There's no better (there's no better way to spend my life)
No better way (no netter way to spend my time)
Forever (forever it's Your presence I'll chase)
Everything else (everything else proceeds from here)

No better way to spend my time
