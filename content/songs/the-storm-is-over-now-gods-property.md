[Chorus: God's Property]
It's over now
It's over now
I feel like I can make it
The storm is over now
It's over now
It's over now
I feel like I can make it
The storm is over now
[Male Lead]
It's over now
It's over now
I feel like I can make it
The storm is over now
[Female Lead]
No more cloudy days
They're all gone, gone away
I feel like I can make it
The storm is over now
Can you help me say
[Chorus: God's Property, 
Female Lead
]
No more cloudy days
(
They're all gone, they're all gone
)
They're are gone away (
Gone away
)
I feel like I can make it (
The storm is
)
The storm is over now
