Lord, You promised if I keep my mind on You
You'd keep me in perfect peace
(Yes you would, you'd keep me in perfect peace)
With a sincere heart if I called upon Your name
You'd never turn away from me
(No, no you'd never turn away from me)
Said you'd give me everything I need
(You'd give me everything I need)
I came for deliverance
Deliverance I'll receive
You said You'd deliver me
And that's what I believe
So now every promise is mine, Lord (It's mine)
I claim it (Oh yes, I know It's mine)
By faith I receive it it's mine (It's mine)
Won't leave here like I came ; I'm never gonna be the same
I know (It's mine)
By faith I believe I believe (Oh yes, I know It's mine)
Reach out and receive now (It's mine)
Won't leave here like I came; I'm never gonna be the same
You can be saved just say'
