Here before Your Throne 
Most Holy, Almighty God 
Loving Father loving us all
For You, we pour our love in song

Hallowed be Your Name 
Great and Mighty God
Hallowed be Your Name 
All sufficient One
Hallowed be Your Name 
Shepherd of my soul
Hallowed be Your Name

Basking in the light of You 
Lamb of God full of Grace and Truth
I remember Your death on the cross
For You, I pour my love in song

Basking in the light of You
