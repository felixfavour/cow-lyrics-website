you unravel me
with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance,
 from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone
 I'm no longer a slave to fear
 I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
 I am a child of God
From my mothers womb You have chosen me
Love has called my name
 I've been born again,
 into a family
Your blood flows through my veins
 I'm no longer a slave to fear
 I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
 I am a child of God
 I'm no longer a slave to fear
 I am a child of God
 I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
 I am surrounded
By the arms of the father
 I am surrounded
By songs of deliverance
We've been liberated
From our bondage
Were the sons and the daughters
Let us sing our freedom
oh, oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,ohoh,oh
You split the sea So I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me And I will stand and sing
I am the child of God
You split the sea So I could walk right through it
You drowned my fears in perfect love
 You rescued me And I will stand and sing I am the child of God (yes I am)
 I am a Child of God I am a Child of God (yes I am)
 I am a Child of God (full of faith yes)
 I am a Child of God I am a Child of God I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
