Idi Ebube(you are great)
Idi Omimi(you are indescribable)
Look what the Lord has done
Look what the Lord has done
Onu’m apu gi koya(my mouth cannot tell it all)

Testimonies
So good to be true
But the evidence
This world cannot deny
Can you see what the Lord has done
Look what the Lord has done
Onu’m apu gi koya(my mouth cannot tell it all)

Idi Ebube(you are great)
Idi Omimi(you are indescribable)
Look what the Lord has done
Look what the Lord has done
Onu’m apu gi koya(my mouth cannot tell it all)

Some things are good
Some things are beautiful
But there are things that you will see oh
Things that you will hear of
You’ll know that this is the hand of God

Some things are good
Some things are beautiful
But there are things that you will see oh
Things that you will hear of
You’ll know that this is the hand of God

Idi Ebube(you are great)
Idi Omimi(you are indescribable)
Look what the Lord has done
Look what the Lord has done
Onu’m apu gi koya(my mouth cannot tell it all)

What the Lord has done
What the Lord has done
What the Lord has done
It’s so amazing

Idi Ebube(you are great)
Idi Omimi(you are indescribable)
Look what the Lord has done
Look what the Lord has done
Onu’m apu gi koya(my mouth cannot tell it all)
