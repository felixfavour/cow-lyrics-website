How can I describe Your beauty
O for words to tell it all
Love Divine, You're mine completely
None can rival You at all
The more I know You
The more I love You
You are beautiful to me
The more I see You
The more I need You
Jesus, beautiful to me
Beautiful to me
Who would dare compare Your glory
Who could e're behold Your face
I will spend my life exploring
How You take my breath away
The more I know You
The more I love You
You are beautiful to me
The more I see You
The more I need You
Jesus, beautiful to me
