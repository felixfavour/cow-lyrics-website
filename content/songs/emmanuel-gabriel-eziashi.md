This is a victory song Jesus is glorified
He has taken the pain and given me laughter
There's a melody in my heart And a new song in my mouth
I will sing for joy tell the world of his great works
Emmanuel has done it again
I have come to testify
He has done it again
The blind can see again ooo
The lame can walk again ooo
The dump can speak again ooo
We have come to testify He has done it again
The single is married again ooo
The barren is fruitful again ooo
Shame is taken away ooo
We have come to testify He has done it again
Cancer is healed again ooo
Diseases are healed again away ooo
Doors are opened again ooo
We have come to testify He has done it again
Chains are broken again ooo
Diseases disappears again ooo
The pain is gone again ooo
We have come to testify He has done it again
