[Chorus]
Like oil from the jar
Water from the well
Out of Your heart, it won't stop
It's a never-ending love
I was empty
In need of grace
I was searching
In every wrong place
Desperate for love
Crying for help, uh
Out of nowhere You came running
Now I'm running out to tell
Like oil from the jar
Water from the well (Whoo!)
Out of Your heart, it won't stop
It's a never-ending love (Hey!)
Joy, grace flowing
Unending love
Joy (Hey), grace (I brought a witness), flowing
You left heaven
To walk beside men
Faced temptation (
Oh, yeah, yeah
)
Still You knew no sin
Tried and crucified
You took the nails and died (
Preach
)
Out of the tomb (
Out the tomb
)
You came running (
You came running
)
Now I'm running out to tell
