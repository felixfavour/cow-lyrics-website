Children weep no more
Hope is on the horizon
Weary world behold
Your promised Messiah
Angels let your song begin
Here comes heaven
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Here comes heaven
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Angels let your song begin (Gloria)
Here comes heaven (Gloria)
Gloria in excelsis's deio
O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear
