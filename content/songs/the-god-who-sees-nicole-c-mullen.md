Hagar was a single mother
She was abandoned by the family she belonged to
And there in the wilderness with her son alone
With very little provision
She was wondering
She was questioning
Does anyone care?
She's crying in the desert
She's lost in her despair
She thinks nobody loves her
Hagar thinks nobody's there
But God says
I will be a ring of fire around her
And I will be the glory in her midst
And the power of my presence
Will bring her to her knees
And I will lift her up again
For I'm the God who sees
I'm the God who sees
Then He speaks in gentle whispers
And He softly calls her name
She feels His arms enfold her
As He holds her
And she'll never be the same
