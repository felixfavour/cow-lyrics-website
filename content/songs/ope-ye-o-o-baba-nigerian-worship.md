Ope ye O o Baba
Ope ye O o Omo
(my Father You deserve my gratitude)

Eledumare as'oore kaari aiye
(The Creator who shares His blessings throughout the world)
O s'oore f'Oba O tun se t'ijoye loto
(You give to kings You give to rulers)

Ko ma gbagbe emi omo Re rara
(You also give to Your children)
Ope ye O o Baba
(My Father You deserve my gratitude)
