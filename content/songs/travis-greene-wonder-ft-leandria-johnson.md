I've been through hurt
I've been through pain
Wish I had time
So I could explain
How God's been good
Oh, He made a way
Every time I was in trouble
Somehow, He won the battle
Now I know
It was nobody
Now I know
It was nobody but You
When my soul looks back and wonder
Oh, how I made it over
When my soul looks back and wonder
Now I know
It was nobody
Nobody but You
I've been through ups and downs
Doctor's reports
With no one around
But You've been there
When I needed You most (When I needed You most)
Every time I was in trouble
Somehow, You won the battle
Now I know
It was nobody (It was nobody)
Now I know
It was nobody but You
When my soul looks back and wonder
How I made it over (How I made it over, ooh)
When my soul looks back and wonder (Since I've been with Him)
Now I know
It was, it was nobody
Nobody but You
It was nobody
Oh Lord, it was nobody but you
So we lift our voice and we cry
Hallelujah, thank You Lord
You have been a wonder in my soul
Hallelujah, thank You Lord
Oh, You have been a wonder in my soul
Hallelujah, thank You Lord
You have been a wonder in my soul
Hallelujah, thank You Lord
You know I thank You Lord
You have been a wonder in my soul, yeah
When my soul looks back
How I made it over (I couldn't imagine with out You)
When my soul looks back and wonder (Lord, I couldn't live without You, yeah)
Now, now I know
It was nobody, no
Nobody but You
Nobody but You Lord
(How do You feel with Him? What would it be without You?)
