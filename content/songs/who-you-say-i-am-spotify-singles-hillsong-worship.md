Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me
I was lost but He brought me in
Oh, His love for me
Oh, His love for me
[Chorus: Brooke Ligertwood & Jad Gillies]
Who the Son sets free
Oh, is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
Free at last, He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep
While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me
Yes He died for me
[Chorus: Brooke Ligertwood & Jad Gillies]
Who the Son sets free
Oh, is free indeed
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
In my Father's house
There's a place for me
I'm a child of God
Yes I am
