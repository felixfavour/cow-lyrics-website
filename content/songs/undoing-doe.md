[Intro]
Ah, yeah
Oh, oh
Mm, mm
Mm, oh
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
The more I learn You
The more I find, the more I know, the more I love You, mm
For who You are
I thought I knew You
But You unlocked and You unraveled me to see You
For who You are
And I love
And I love, I love, I love what You've been doing, mm
It's undoing
The lies, the lies that I believe
(I love) And I love, I love, I love what I'm unlearning
And I've been learning (And I've been learning)
The truth is setting me (The truth is setting me), yeah, ooh
Free, oh (Ah)
You're changing the way that I think
The way I receive
The love that You offer me so freely
It's just who You are (Mm, da)
And I thought I didn't I belong
I had it so wrong
And now I'm finally believing
It's just who You are
