Beneath the surface
Of my anxious imagination
Beckons a calmness
That is found in You alone
It washes over
Every doubt, every imperfection
Jesus, Your presence
Is the comfort of my soul
There's nowhere I'd rather be
When You're singing over me
I just wanna be here with You
I'm lost in Your mystery
I'm found in Your love for me
I just wanna be here with You
Here in the waiting
I won't worry about tomorrow
No need to focus
On the things I can't control
All my attention
On the wonder of this moment
Jesus, Your presence
Is the comfort of my soul
