Oh, let the Son of God enfold you
With his Spirit and his love
Let him fill your heart and satisfy your soul
Oh, let him have the things that hold you
And his Spirit, like a dove
Will descend upon your life and make you whole
Jesus, O Jesus, come and fill your lambs
Jesus, O Jesus, come and fill your lambs
Oh, come and sing the song with gladness
As your hearts are filled with joy
Lift your hands in sweet surrender to his name
Oh, give him all your tears and sadness
Give him all your years of pain
And you'll enter into life in Jesus' name
Jesus, O Jesus, come and fill your lambs
Jesus, O Jesus, come and fill your lambs
Oh, let the Son of God enfold you
With his Spirit and his love
Let him fill your heart and satisfy your soul
Oh, let him have the things that hold you
And his Spirit, like a dove
Will descend upon your life and make you whole
Will descend upon your life and make you whole
