All to you, All to You
I give it all to You
All to you, All to You
I give it all to You
I lay my life before You
Lord I surrender all
All that I have been through
I give it to You now
And though I have some questions
Things I'll never understand
I come into Your presence
And I place them in Your hands
All to you, All to You
I give it all to You
All to you, All to You
I give it all to You
I know that You are faithful
That Your promises are true
Your mercy will sustain me
And Your grace will see me through
So i lift my hands before You
As a sacrifice and praise
I cast my cares upon You
And I come to You in faith
