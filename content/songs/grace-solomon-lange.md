Amazing grace is the sweetest sound
That saved my life
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
You took my shame, You took my pain
My Jesus gave me His name
Now I reign, I reign with Him
All my days, I'll sing His praise
Everywhere that I go, everything that I do
All I see is grace
Everywhere that I go, everything that I do
All I see is grace
Grace, grace, grace (I see grace)
Grace, grace, grace (all I see is grace)
Grace, Great, grace (I see grace)
Grace, Great, grace (all I see is grace)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Amazing grace, amazing grace
Is the story of my life
It's not by power, it's not by might
It's by the Spirit of the Lord
It's not by hard work, it's not by skills
Divine help is what I enjoy
I'm not afraid of tomorrow
I have grace, great, grace
Everywhere that I go, everything that I do
(All I see is grace)
Everywhere that I go, everything that I do
(All I see is grace)
Grace, grace (I see grace)
Great, grace (all I see is grace)
Grace, grace (I see grace)
Great, grace (all I see is grace)
I am the Jehovah is at work in my life
The Spirit of Yahweh is at work in my heart
Everywhere that I go, everything that I do
(All I see is grace)
Everywhere that I go, everything that I do, eh
(All I see is grace)
Everywhere that I go (I see grace)
Everything that I do (all I see is grace)
Everywhere that I go (I see grace)
Everything that I do (all I see is grace)
I have help, help (I see grace)
The help of God (all I see is grace)
The grace of God is my advantage (I see grace)
The grace of God is my advantage (all I see grace)
The weapons of our warfare are not carnal (I see grace)
They are mighty
They are mighty through God (all I see is grace)
(I see grace)
Great grace (all I see is grace)
Great grace
Great grace
Oh-oh-oh
Great grace
All I see is grace
All I see is grace
The grace of our Lord Jesus
The love of the Father
And the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit
Abiding with us all the days of our life and forever
