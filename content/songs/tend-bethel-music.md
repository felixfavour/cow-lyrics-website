In the landscape of my life
You don't rush through any season
You always take Your time
A careful hand, a gentle guide
You take what's dead away
And You prune what's runnin' wild
So be the gardener of my heart, tend the soil of my soul
Break up the fallow ground, cut back the overgrown
And I won't shy away, I will let the branches fall
So what You want can stay and what You love can grow
Through the winter, I'm still alive
What You've planted in the dirt
Is ever reaching to the light
You prepare me for darkened times
You'll sustain what You have started
And You'll teach me to abide
Be the gardener of my heart, tend the soil of my soul
Break up the fallow ground, cut back the overgrown
And I won't shy away, I will let the branches fall
So what You want can stay and what You love can grow, grow
