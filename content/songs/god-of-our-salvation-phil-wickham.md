Come and see His glory
Come just as you are
Come and hear the story of His heart
[Pre-Chorus]
God so loved His children
He gave His Only Son
That we might be forgiven
Death has been overcome
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You are the God of our salvation
You have conquered
You have risen
You are the God of our salvation
Come, you tired and you weary
Come just as you are
Come and let His mercy heal your heart
[Pre-Chorus]
For God so loved His children
That He gave His Only Son
That we might be forgiven
Death has been overcome
