Comforter for every time I've been left forsaken
Dem blow me shot but you da pada
Never go down never undertaken
So many times me I don fall down
E be your mercy be talking for me

I never see your pikin forsaken
Holy water omi yale

You Dey bless me Sunday to Sunday
I don count am over complete
I try talk am e no finish
I don check am I dey convinced say

On God e sure me say
Condemna condemnation dey far away
Ibukun just dey come my way

Never never to turn away
Say make nobody bother me
I've decided say all my days
Na for Jesu to control e o control e yaya
Holy water omi yale
I no gok am mo sa wole
Crown of glory Adewole
You Dey bless me Sunday to Sunday
I don count am over complete
I try talk am e no finish
I don check am I dey convinced say
Baba do me correct o
Anointing for head o
I Dey steady collect o
On God e sure me say
Baba do me correct o
Anointing for head o
I Dey steady collect o
On God e sure me say
