You and me
That I like the most
Imisi okan
Come Holy Ghost
Fade off the partition
There's no sweeter sensation
Than you and me close
How far can I go
You're the one I call home
Away you should know
Only you
Only you satisfy
Satisfy my soul
You're everywhere I go
Oh you're my antidote
Only you
For Only you
Fire! I'm burning
All for your loving
It's you or nothing
(Burn burn it up up burn it up up)
Oh
Show me something
There's no higher calling
As long as you love me
(Burn burn it up up burn it up up)
You're the one I want
You're the one that I need I wanna eh
The one I want
You're the one that I need ah eh
You're the one I want You're the one
That I need I wanna eh eh
(Burn burn it up up burn it up up)
O come hold me and
You're the one I want
You're the one that I need I wanna eh
The one I want
You're the one that I need ah eh
You're the one I want You're the one
That I need I wanna eh eh
(Burn burn it up up burn it up up)
O come Holy Holy
You and me
There's nothing less to see
It's just more
It's just ever, innit?
Weighing your persuasion
Oh
I have no objections
I'll damn everything else
How far can I go
You're the one I call home
Away you should know
Only you
Only you satisfy
Satisfy my soul
You're everywhere I go
Oh you're my antidote
Only you
For Only you
Fire! I'm burning
All for your loving
It's you or nothing
(Burn burn it up up burn it up up)
Oh
Show me something
There's no higher calling
As long as you love me
(Burn burn it up up burn it up up)
You're the one I want
You're the one that I need I wanna eh
The one I want
You're the one that I need ah eh
You're the one I want You're the one
That I need I wanna eh eh
(Burn burn it up up burn it up up)
O come hold me and
You're the one I want
