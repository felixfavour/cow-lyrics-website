You make it easy to love You
You are good and You are kind
You bring joy into my life
You make it easy to trust You
You have never left my side
You've been faithful every time
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, all I want is You, Jesus
All I want is You (Come on)
You are the refuge I run to
You are the fire that leads me through the night
I’ll follow You anywhere
There's a million reasons to trust You
Nothing to fear, for You are by my side
I'll follow You anywhere
Oh Jesus, You came to my rescue
Took my place upon that cross
You redeemed what I had lost
Now my whole world revolving around You (Yes)
You’re the center of my life
You're the treasure, You're the prize
