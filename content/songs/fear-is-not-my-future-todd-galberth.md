Let him turn it in your favor
Watch him work it for your good
He's not done with what he started
He's not done until it's good
Let him work it for your favor
Watch him turn it for your good
He's done with what he started
He's not done until it's good
Hello peace, hello joy, hello love
Hello strength, hello hope it's a new horizon
If you're ready for a breakthrough
You can open up and just receive
Cause what he's pouring out is nothing
You've ever seen
Hello peace, hello joy, hello lovе
Hello strength, hello hopе it's a new horizon
It's a new horizon
Fear is not my future, you are
Sickness, not my story, you are
Heartbreak's not my home, you are
Death is not the end, you are
