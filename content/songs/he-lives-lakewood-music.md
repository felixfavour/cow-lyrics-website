More than a day He in a manger
To nobles would humbly bow their knee
For the young man who ever knew a Savior
He is alive in me
More than the man who walked on water
Or the one who 'cause blinded eyes to see
Greater than all the signs and wonders
He is alive in me
He lives, He lives
He conquered the grace, He covered our sins
He lives, He lives
Death would not hold the promise within, He lives
More than the man who heard Hosanna
From the same who cried, "Crucify the King"Freely He gave as they demanded
Still He's alive in me
More than the man, mankind rejected
With nails in His hands and through His feet
But the end told much more than they expected
For everyone knows that three days He rose
With power forever to redeem, yeah, you and me
