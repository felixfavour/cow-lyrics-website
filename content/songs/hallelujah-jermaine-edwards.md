I come just now to say thank you oh King
You're not just a part of my life but my everything
Your love reaches way down deep within
Passes human understanding
There will always be a song for you I'll sing
One word alone just can express my heart desires
Gratitude for one more day my needs supply
Your warm embrace and tenderness
Patient with me through all my mess
I come to one conclusion
You are the best

Hallelujah
To our King
Hallelujah
I will sing
You are great
Almighty
All honour
