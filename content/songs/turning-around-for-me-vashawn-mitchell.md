Sometimes discouraged but not defeated
Cast down but not destroyed
There're times I don't understand
But I believe its turning around for me
I've had troubles and disappointments
There're times I felt so alone
Some of my friends they let me down
But I still believe its turning around for me
Around for me, around for me
Around for me
It's turning around for me
Around for me, around for me
Around for me
It's turning around for me
I can see the breaking of day
God is making a way
A change is coming for me
If I stand strong and believe
There is no reason to doubt
I know he's working it out
It's turning around for me
It won't always be like this
He will perfect that concerning me
And sooner or later it'll turn in my favor
Sooner or later, turn in my favor
It's turning around for me
