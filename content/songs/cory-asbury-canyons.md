And I've scaled all the highest of mountains
And I've stood at the edge of their peaks
But I still couldn't see to the edge of
Your love for me
And I've walked on the wildest of waters
And I've sunk to the depths of the sea
But I still couldn't fathom the depths of
Your love for me
Canyons wide, oceans deep
Can't contain all Your love for me
No matter how high or far I reach
There's no end to Your love for me
And I've wrestled belief in the valley
And I barely hung on through the night
But just when I thought it was darkest
The sun began to rise
Canyons wide, oceans deep
Can't contain all Your love for me
No matter how high or far I reach
There's no end to Your love for me
Where could I run that You wouldn't run after me?
How could I fall when You already took the fall for me?
Beyond the stars to the very breath I breathe
There's no end to Your love for me
Where could I run that You wouldn't run after me?
How could I fall when You already took the fall for me?
Beyond the stars to the very breath I breathe
There's no end to Your love for me
Canyons wide, oceans deep
Can't contain all Your love for me
No matter how high or far I reach
There's no end to Your love for me
Your love for me
Nothing but Your love.
