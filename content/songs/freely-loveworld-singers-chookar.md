Freely
Freely You gave me eternal life
Life so indestructible

Freely
Freely You gave me Your righteousness
To live for You in liberty

Freely
Freely You gave me eternal life
Life so indestructible

Freely
Freely You gave me Your righteousness
To live for You in liberty

If I could afford to pay for everything You gave to me
It'd still be with all the wealth You gave me freely

If I were to estimate or quantify the value of Your love
It'd still be with all the wisdom You gave me

Father of love, You truly are
You made the sun shine on all creation
Father Your love is unreserved
Freely You blessed me beyond imagination

Father of love, You truly are
You made the sun shine on all creation
Father Your love is unreserved
Freely You blessed me beyond imagination

Freely
Freely You gave me unhindered access
To stand before Your presence

Freely
Freely You gave me the Holy Spirit
That's how come I know about the things
You freely gave to me

That's how I know how to harness
Every gift You have given to me

If I could afford to pay for everything You gave to me
It'd still be with all the wealth You gave me freely

If I were to estimate or quantify the value of Your love
It'd still be with all the wisdom You gave me 

Father of love, You truly are
You made the sun shine on all creation 

Father Your love is unreserved 
Freely You blessed me beyond imagination
