God was there at the beginning, His Spirit brooding like a dove
Spoke the earth into existence, formed creation that He loved
Man was born of perfect image, made to be a friend of God
Meant to dwell within His presence, yeah, it's where we all belong
Holy Spirit
All we need is more of You, we want more of You
Holy Spirit
All we need is more of You, we want more of You
When sin had spoiled creation, the Creator sent a flood
On the cusp of new beginning, He again released the dove
And after all the searching, it found a place to land
On Christ, the perfect son who would redeem it all again
Looking for the branches, it landed on the vine
The one for our redemption who would bridge eternal life
Holy Spirit, the truth, the living water
All we need is more of You, we want more of You
Holy Spirit, the helper and the healer
All we need is more of You, we want more of You
Holy Spirit, the truth, the living water
All we need is more of You, we want more of You
Holy Spirit, the helper and the healer
All we need is more of You, we want more of You
