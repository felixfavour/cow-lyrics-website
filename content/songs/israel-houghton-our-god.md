Water you turn into wine, open the eyes of the blind,  there's no one like you , none like you.
Into the darkness u shine, out of the ashes we rise, there's no one like you none like you,,
(chorus)
Ooh, our God is greater, our God is stronger, lord you are higher than any other, our God is healer awesome in power  our God, our God.
oooo ooooo ooooo oooooo
Into the darkness u shine, out of the ashes we rise, there's no one like you (no one like you) none like you..
And if our God is for us then who can ever stop us, And if our God is with us no one can stand against
