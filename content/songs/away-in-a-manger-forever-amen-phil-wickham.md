Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus, laid down His sweet head
The stars in the sky, looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay
The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes
The dawn of salvation, beginning to break
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, oh, gift from above
The King of the Heavens, forever with us! (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah! (Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, mm (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh, mm (Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh-oh) Oh, oh, oh, oh
I worship You, Jesus, for all of my days!
The highest of praises be unto Your name!
My God and my Savior!
My King and my friend!
Yours is the glory, forever, Amen!
Yours is the glory, forever, Amen!
Yours is the glory, forever, Amen!
