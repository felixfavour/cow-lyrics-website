All the way my savior leads me
Who have i to ask beside
How could i doubt his tender mercy
Who through life has been my guide
All the way my savior leads me
Cheers each winding path i tread
Gives me grace for every trial
Feeds me with the living bread
You lead me and keep me from falling
You carry me close to your heart
And surely your goodness and mercy will follow me
All the way my savior leads me
O, the fullness of his love
O, the sureness of his promise
In the triumph of his blood
And when my spirit clothed immortal
Wings its flight to realms of day
This my song through endless ages
Jesus led me all the way
Jesus led me all the way
