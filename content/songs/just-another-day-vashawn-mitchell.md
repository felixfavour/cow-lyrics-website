Lead
Just another day the Lord has kept me
Just another day the Lord has blessed
Inspite of my struggles and my trouble
I'm still here
Just another day the Lord has kept me
Just another day the Lord has blessed
Inspite of my struggles and my trouble
I'm still here, im still here
Chorus
Just another day the Lord has kept me
Just another day the Lord has blessed
Inspite of my struggles and my trouble
I'm still here
Just another day the Lord has kept me
Just another day the Lord has blessed
Inspite of my struggles and my trouble
I'm still here, im still here
Just another day to give Him glory
(just another day to lift my hands)
Another day to tell the world the story
(how He gave me another chance)
How he gave me another chance
Chorus
Just another day the Lord has kept me
Just another day the Lord has blessed
Inspite of my struggles and my trouble
I'm still here
Just another day the Lord has kept me
Just another day the Lord has blessed
Inspite of my struggles and my trouble
I'm still here, im still here
