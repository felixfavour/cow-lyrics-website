We laid our lives down here at Your feet
To the One who's worthy, we give everything
Oh, how You love us, how can it be?
No greater mercy, You gave everything
To You be all the glory, to You be all the honor
Forever be praised, forever be praised
For You alone are worthy and You alone are holy
Forever be praised, forever be praised
Wе bow in reverencе before our King
The only sovereign, oh, what majesty
We sing Your praises, how could we not?
We're filled with wonder, Lord, we stand in awe
To You be all the glory, to You be all the honor
Forever be praised, forever be praised
For You alone are worthy and You alone are holy
Forever be praised, forever be praised
[Bridge]
Be magnified, be glorified
Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Lamb
As one we cry, be lifted high
Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Lamb
Be magnified, be glorified
Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Lamb
As one we cry, be lifted high
Worthy is the Lamb, worthy is the Lamb
