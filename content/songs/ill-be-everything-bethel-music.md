When you're underwater, don't know up from down
You don't need to fight it, just surrender now
I know your heart is aching, you feel in the dark
You are not alone, I know where you are
And lay your burdens down, lay it all on Me
Rest your weary head and I'll be all you need
I'll be everything, everything, yeah
I'll be everything, everything, yeah
I'll be everything, everything, yeah
Ooh-ooh
You are rising up to the surface now
You will get through this, I will show you how
Now your mind is clearing and your heart is strong
I am taking you to where you belong
And lay your burdens down, lay it all on Me
Rest your weary head and I'll be all you need
I'll be everything, everything, yeah
I'll be everything, everything, yeah
I'll be everything, everything, yeah
