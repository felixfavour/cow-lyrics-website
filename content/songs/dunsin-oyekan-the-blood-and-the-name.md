The Blood And The Name"
When I call the name of Jesus
I hear the blood crying out
He who owns the name
Has the blood
And He speaks
Better things for me
When I call the name of Jesus
I hear the blood crying out
He who owns the name
Has the blood
And He speaks
Better things for me
So I call Jesus
And I see the blood working
I call Jesus
And His blood yet speaks for me
When I call the name of Jesus
I hear the blood crying out
He who owns the name
Has the blood
And He speaks
Better things for me
When I call the name of Jesus
I hear the blood crying out
He who owns the name
Has the blood
And He speaks
Better things for me
So I call Jesus
And I see the blood working
I call Jesus
And His blood yet speaks for me
So I call Jesus
And I see the blood working
I call Jesus
And His blood yet speaks for me
