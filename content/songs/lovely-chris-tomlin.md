I watch Your wonders fill the sky
Over the mountains, reaching high
The same majesty floods my life
I stand in awe
Lovely, there is none more lovely
In all the universe, there is no one lovelier
Worthy, there is none more worthy
I try to find the words
There's so much more You're worthy of
Up on the cross with open arms
The love of God reaches far
The same majesty floods my heart
I stand in awe
Lovely, there is none more lovely
In all the universe, there is no one lovelier
Worthy, there is none more worthy
I try to find the words
There's so much more You're worthy of
