Hear my cry oh God
Hear my cry oh God
Attend unto my prayer
From the ends of the earth
From the ends of the earth
Will I cry unto thee
When my heart is overwhelmed
When my heart is overwhelmed
Lead me to that rock
Lead me to that rock
That is higher than I
For Thou has been
For Thou has been
A shelter for me
A mighty strong tower
From the enemy
When my heart is overwhelmed
When my heart is overwhelmed
Lead me to that Rock
Lead me to that Rock
That is higher than I
