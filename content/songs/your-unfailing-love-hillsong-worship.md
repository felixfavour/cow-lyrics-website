When the darkness fills my senses
When my blindness keeps me from Your touch
Jesus come
When my burden keeps me doubting
When my memories take the place of You
Jesus come
And I'll follow You there
To the place where we meet
And I'll lay down my pride
As You search me again
Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love
Your unfailing love over me again
Your unfailing love, Your unfailing love
Your unfailing love over me again
When the darkness fills my senses
When my blindness keeps me from Your touch
Jesus come
When my burden keeps me doubting
When my memories take the place of You
Jesus, Jesus come
