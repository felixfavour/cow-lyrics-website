Alagbada Ina
The One who's clothed with fire
Your voice resounds like thunder
We glorify your name

The One with eyes of fire
Your name is full of wonders
Come and manifest Yourself

You are the Holy one
Dwelling in light so bright
You made the sun and the moon
But you shine brighter than all
As we rejoice and call upon Your name
Please come and take Your place
And manifest Yourself

All things are possible
Nothing is hard for You
If we believe in Your name
And we can stand on Your word
These are the days

Days of miracles and power

Adversaries surrender
At the sound of your voice

Revival is here
The nations will worship
Worship Jesus alone
We worship You
We bless Your name
