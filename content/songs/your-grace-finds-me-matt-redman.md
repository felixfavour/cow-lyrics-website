It's there in the newborn cry
There in the light of every sunrise
There in the shadows of this light
Your great grace
It's there on the mountain top
There in the everyday and the mundane
There in the sorrow and the dancing
Your great grace, oh, such grace
From the creation to the cross
There from the cross into eternity
Your grace finds me
Yes, Your grace finds me
It's there on a wedding day
There in the weeping by the graveside
There in the very breath we breathe
Your great grace
The same for the rich and poor
The same for the saint and for the sinner
Enough for this whole wide world
Your great grace, oh, such grace
