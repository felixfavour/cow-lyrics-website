se 1:
Oh everlasting king
Your goodness and love endures
Your mercy is ever sure
And your reign forevermore
God omnipotent one
Sufficient and full of grace
No one compares to you
So we've come to reference you
Chorus:
Bo Itoro (2x)
You have done what no man has done
Receive all our praise today
Venue 2:
Highly exalted one
Your wisdom no man can search
Holy anointed one
You are faithful, you are true
Wonderful loving God
All glory is yours forever
Worthy of all our praise
We will bow and worship you
Chorus:
Bo Itoro (2x)
You have done what no man has done
Receive all our praise today
You have done what no man has done
You have Healed Who no man Can Heal
You have Saved who no man can save
Receive all my Praise Today
