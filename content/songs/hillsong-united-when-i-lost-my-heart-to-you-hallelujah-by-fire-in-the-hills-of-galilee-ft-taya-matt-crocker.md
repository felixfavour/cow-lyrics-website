Love
Laid its breath against my chest
My skin was thick
But You breathed down all my walls
Love
Like the fire steals the cold
The ice wore thin
As Your light tore through my door
You have my heart
You have my heart
You have my heart oh God
You have my heart
Oh hallelujah
Hallelujah
Oh hallelujah
I found Your love
When I lost my heart to You
Love
Trading crowns to wear my shame
The Prince's throne for the cross that bore my thorns
Oh love
Like crashing waves of endless grace
You won't relent
Until all I am is Yours
You have my heart
You have my heart
You have my heart oh God
You have my heart
Oh hallelujah
Hallelujah
Oh hallelujah
I found Your love
When I lost my heart to You
Oh hallelujah
Hallelujah
Oh hallelujah
I found Your love
When I lost my heart to You
You have my heart oh God
And I have this love in You
