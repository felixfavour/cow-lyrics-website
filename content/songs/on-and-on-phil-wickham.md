[Intro]
(Oh, oh, ooh)
(Oh, oh, ooh)
A love beyond what I could dream
You sent Your Son to rescue me
The light of all the stars will fade away
But God, You stay the same
Forever faithful to forgive
You will be faithful 'til the end
[Pre-Chorus]
The kingdoms of the earth will fade away
But God, You stay the same
You'll never stop chasing us
You'll never stop reaching out
You'll never give up on us
Your love goes on and on and on
And if I lose my way
You'll come and seek me out
You'll never give up on us
Your love goes on and on and on and on
