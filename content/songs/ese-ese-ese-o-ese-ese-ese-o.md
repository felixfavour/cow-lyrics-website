My victory is in your blood
My confidence is in your name
You took the shame so I can shine
So much you did without a price

This is not just a lovely song
This is the story of my days
I'm a product of your grace
I won't be here without your love

I just want to thank you, for your love
For the perfect sacrifice you made for me on the cross
I just want to thank you

Lord I just want to thank you for the blood you sent
That set me free and make me live
Oh, lord i’m grateful

Lord where would I be without you
Lord where would we be without you
Oh, oh I'm grateful
Grateful
Grateful

After all his said and done
I’m who I am because of you
What can I give for all this love
What can I say but give you thanks
