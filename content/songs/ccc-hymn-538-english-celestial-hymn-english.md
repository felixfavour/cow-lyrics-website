1.  THE world had been bent to one side
Satan is driven with Shame,
Oh sinners come on 
board the last ship,
So that you may not be missing.

2.  Father’s mercy is soon to an end
He no more would listen to prayers
Unrest and epidemic diseases
And difficulties
draweth near the world.

3.  Father wants sinners perish not,
Also He wants them not to die,
Come to me said the Salvation Voice,
I will redeem ye altogether.

4.  All ye be in genuine love,
And be of better behaviour,
Ye continue to be prayerful,
I’ll be with you to the last time. 
 Amen
