Who can stand against the Lord
No one can, No one will
Who can stand against the king
No one can, No one will
Ohhh, ohhh
Victory Belongs To Jesus
Victory belongs to Him
We put our trust in you
We put our hope in you
You will deliver, you're a provider
I find my victory in you
Forever victorious, forever we win
I find my victory in you
Victory Belongs To Jesus
Victory belongs to Him
Ohhh, ohhh
Victory Belongs To Jesus
Victory belongs to Him
