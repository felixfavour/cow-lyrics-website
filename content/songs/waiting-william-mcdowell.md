The Lord is here, the Lord is here
And I can feel His presence here
And I don't know what I should do
So I will wait on You
The Lord is here, the Lord is here
And I can feel His presence near
So be still and know that He is God
Just wait... right here
Oh Lord, teach me how to wait
When there's no words to say
Even then, give me grace to stay
Right here, in the secret place
Where time doesn't matter, eternity waits
And I will not move 'till I stand face to face
With You... with You
All I want is You
[Repeat several times]
