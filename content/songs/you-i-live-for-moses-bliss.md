Hallelujah
I live above the systems of the world
I totally rely on Your word
No matter what may come my way
No matter what I face
It's You, You, You I live for (I live above)
I live above the systems of the world
I totally rely on Your word
No matter what may come my way
No matter what I face
It's You, You, You I live for
(We live for You alone, in the world)
In a world of so many voices
Lord, I will trust in Your precious word
I believe in Your name
In a world where everyone's talking
Lord, I delight in Your precious word
I bеlieve in Your name (in a world of so many voicеs)
In a world of so many voices
Lord, I will trust in Your precious word
I believe in Your name
In a world where everyone's talking
Lord, I delight in Your precious word
I believe in Your name (it's only You that matters)
Only You matter
Only You make sense
Doesn't matter what the world says
It's only You I live for
Only You matter
Only You make sense
Doesn't matter what the world says
It's only You I live for
Only You matter
Only You make sense
It doesn't matter what the world says
It's only You I live for
Only You matter
Only You make sense
Doesn't matter what the world says
It's only You I live for
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh Lord
It's You I live for
Oh-oh-oh yeah, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
It's You I live for
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
It's You I live for
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
It's You I live for
In a world of so many voices
Lord, I will trust in Your precious word
I believe in Your name
In a world where everyone's talking
Lord, I delight in Your precious word
I believe in Your name
In a world of so many voices
Lord, I will trust in Your precious word
I believe in Your name
In a world where everyone's talking
Lord, I delight in Your precious word
I believe in Your name
Only You matter
Only You make sense
Doesn't matter what the world says
It's only You I live for
Only You matter
Only You make sense
Doesn't matter what the world says
It's only You I live for
Oh-oh, it's You I live for
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
It's You I live for
I live above the systems of the world
I totally rely on Your word
No matter what may come my way
No matter what I face
It's You, You, You I live for
