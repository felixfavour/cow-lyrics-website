Eyes haven't seen
And ears haven't heard
The kind of blessings
The kind of blessings
That's about to fall on me, woah
'Cause victory is here
Kicked defeat out the door
God's doing a new thing, yeah
Get ready for overflow
'Cause I'm getting ready
(I'm getting ready to see)
Something I've never seen
(Something I've never seen)
Prophesy over your life saying
(I'm getting ready to see)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ohh
Something I've never seen
(Something I've never seen)
Saying I'm getting ready oh-oh-oh, ohh
(I'm getting ready to see)
Something I've never seen
(Something I've never seen)
Say it again, I'm getting ready!
(I'm getting ready to see)
Something I've never seen
(Something I've never seen)
