Yes, the world will bow down and say You are God
Every man will bow down and say You are King
So let's start right now, why would we wait?
King of Glory, fill this place
We just wanna be with You
Just wanna be with You
King of Glory, fill this place
Just wanna be with You
Just wanna be with You
Yes, the world will bow down and say You are God
Every man will bow down and say You are King
So let's start right now, why would we wait?
We can praise You now, in victory
King of Glory, fill this place
We just wanna be with You
We just wanna be with You
King of Glory, fill this place
We just wanna be with You, oh
We just wanna be with You
