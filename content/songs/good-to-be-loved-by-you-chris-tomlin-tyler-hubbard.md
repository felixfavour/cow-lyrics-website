No, I won't fear
No, I won't worry
I know you're here
So who can bring me down?
You never leave
You don't forget me
You're listening
Even when I don't make a sound
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, woah, Heaven knows that I've never been perfect
Oh, woah, there's nothing I can do to deserve it
It's good to be loved by you
It's good to be loved by you
Though my brokenness has seen some days
Your mercy's still brand new
It's good to be loved by you
So good to be loved by you
It don't run out
It's nevеr-ending
It goes as far
As the еast is from the west
