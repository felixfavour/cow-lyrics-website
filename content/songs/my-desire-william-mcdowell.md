Lord we come
With our hearts wide open
Lord we know
You have made us one
Lord, we are waiting
Anticipating
We are creating
A place for you
Lord we come 
(Oh)
With our hearts wide open 
(Open)
Lord we know
You have made us one 
(Made us one)
Lord, we are waiting 
(Anticipating)
Anticipating 
(We are creating)
We are creating
A place for you
[Chorus: Choir feat. 
Melodie Joy
]
My desire 
(My desire)
Is to see 
(A move of God)
A move of God 
(A move in me)
A move in me 
(Oh)
My desire 
(Is to do)
Is to do
All the things 
(He's showing me)
He's showing me 
(Let us create)
Let us create 
(Create a place)
Create a place 
(Releasing your faith)
Releasing faith
For God to move 
(For God to move)
So we will see 
(The power of God)
The power of God 
(And we will know)
And we will know 
(That He is)
That He is God 
(God)
