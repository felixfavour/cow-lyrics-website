I’m pressing on the upward way,
New heights I’m gaining ev'ry day;
Still praying as I’m onward bound,
“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”

Refrain:
Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
By faith, on heaven’s tableland;
A higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell where these abound,
My constant aim is higher ground. 

Beyond the mist, i fain would rise
To rest beneath unclouded skies
Above earth's turmoil, peace is found
By those who dwell on higher ground

I longed to scale the utmost height,
And catch a glimpse of glory bright;
But still I’ll pray till heav’n I’ve found,
“Lord, lead me on to higher ground.” 

Lord, lead me up the mountain side
I dare not climb without my guide
And heaven gained, i'll gaze around
With grateful heart from higher ground
