There is no one greater than You
All our praise belongs to You
Holy in power
Faithful and true
There is none like You
There is no one stronger than You
Sin forever conquered by You
Fearless in life
Faithful in death
There is none like You
Lord You reign
You reign alone
Exalted over all the earth enthroned
The majesty and greatness of Your name
Let all creations sing Lord You reign
There is none more loving than You
Near to all who call out to You
Your mercies anew
You're faithful and true
There is none like You
Lord You reign
You reign alone
Exalted over all the earth enthroned
The majesty and greatness of Your name
Let all creations sing Lord You reign
No one is higher than
The King above all nations
No one is like You God
The name of Jesus is
Higher than any other
No one is like You God
No one is higher than
The King above all nations
No one is like You God
The name of Jesus is
Higher than any other
No one is like You God
Lord You reign
You reign alone
Exalted over all the earth enthroned
The majesty and greatness of Your name
Let all creations sing Lord You reign
Lord You reign
You reign alone
Exalted over all the earth enthroned
The majesty and greatness of Your name
Let all creations sing Lord You reign
Let all creations sing Lord You reign
Let all creations sing Lord You reign
