What to say, Lord? It's
You who gave me life and I
Can't explain just how
Much You mean to me now
That You have saved me, Lord
I give all that I am to You
That everyday I can
Be a light that shines Your name
Everyday, Lord, I'll
Learn to stand upon Your word
And I pray that I
That I might come to know You more
That You would guide me with every single step I take, that
Everyday I can
Be Your light unto the world
Everyday, it's You I live for
Everyday, I'll follow after You
Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord
Everyday, Lord, I'll
Learn to stand upon Your word
And I pray that I
That I might come to know You more
That You would guide me with every single step I take, that
Everyday I can
Be Your light unto the world
Everyday, it's You I live for
Everyday, I'll follow after You
Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord
It's You I live for, everyday
It's You I live for, everyday
It's You I live for, everyday
It's You I live for, everyday
Everyday, it's You I live for
Everyday, I'll follow after You
Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord
Everyday, it's You I live for
Everyday, I'll follow after You
Everyday, I'll walk with You, my Lord
