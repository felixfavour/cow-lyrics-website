Well I could sing unending songs
Of how you saved my soul
And I could dance a thousand miles
Because of your great love
Well I could sing unending songs
Of how you saved my soul
And I could dance a thousand miles
Because of your great love
My heart is bursting Lord
To tell of all you've done
Of how've you changed my life
And wiped away the past
I want to shout it out
From every roof top sing
For now I know
My God is for me, not against me
I could sing unending songs
Of how you saved my soul
Well, I could dance a thousand miles
Because of your great love
My heart is bursting Lord
To tell of all you've done
Of how've you changed my life
And wiped away the past
