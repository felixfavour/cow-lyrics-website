Oh, the weight of His glory, oh, the wonder of His grace
The power of salvation, oh, that brought me from the grave
This hope is not empty, and forever He will reign
And He won't be put to shame
And, oh, my soul, sing to the God of the ages
Sing to the Lord of creation, sing His praise again
And, oh, my soul, sing like the Heavens are waiting
Roar like an army of angels, sing His praise again
From the moment of rescue, I have never been the same
When His love took me captive, and my sin was washed away
Now I stand here forgiven, and I know that I am saved
And I won't be put to shame
And, oh, my soul, oh, sing to the God of the ages
Sing to the Lord of creation, sing His praise again
And, oh, my soul, sing like the Heavens are waiting
And roar like an army of angels, sing His praise again
[Bridge]
And remember how our God has never failed, never failed us
Remember that His name will make a way, He'll make a way
And from the cross to the grave, He is risen and He reigns
Oh, praise the Lord and sing His praise again, remember
Oh, and remember how our God has never failed, never failed us
Remember that His name will make a way, He'll make a way
And from the cross to the grave, He is risen, now He reigns
Oh, praise the Lord, oh, sing His praise again
