Triumphant
I am not defeated
Triumphant
The battle's already won
There's a greater power in me
There's a greater power in me
I will not be defeated
For I know that there's victory for me
I've already won because of the blood
Jesus said on Calvary
Triumphant
If I say it until I can see it
Claim it, it's already mine
The power of life and death is in the tongue
I speak life
Triumphant
I am not defeated
Triumphant
The battle's already won
There's a greater power in me
There's a greater power in me
