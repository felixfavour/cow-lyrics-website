Wandering into the Night
Wanting a Place to Hide
This weary Soul, this Bag of Bones
And I Tried with all my Mind
And I just can't Win the Fight
I'm Slowly Drifting, oh Bag of Bone
And just when I Ran out of Road
I met a Man I didn't know
And he told me that
I was not Alone

He Picked me Up
Turned me Around
Placed my Feet on Solid Ground
I Thank the Master
I Thank the Savior,
Because he Healed my Heart
Changed my Name
Forever Free, I'm not the same
I Thank the Master
I Thank the Savior, I Thank GOD
I cannot deny what I See
Got no Choice but to Believe
My Doubts are Burning
Like Ashes in the Wind
So, so Long to my Old Friends
Burden and Bitter night
You can't just keep them Moving
No you ain't Welcome here
From now till I walk
The Streets of Gold
I'll Sing of how you Saved my Soul
This Wayward Son
Has Found his way back Home

He Picked me Up
Turned me Around
Placed my Feet on Solid Ground
I Thank the Master, I Thank the Savior,
Because he Healed my Heart
Changed my Name
Forever Free, I'm not the same
I Thank the Master
I Thank the Savior, I Thank GOD

{ Hell Lost another One
I am Free, I am Free, I am Free
Hell Lost another One
I am Free, I am Free, I am Free } [Repeat]

He Picked me Up
Turned me Around
Placed my Feet on Solid Ground
I Thank the Master, I Thank the Savior,
Because he Healed my Heart
Changed my Name
Forever Free, I'm not the same
I Thank the Master
I Thank the Savior, I Thank GOD

If he did it for me, He can do it for You
Get-Up, get Up, get Up
Get Up out of that grave
Get-Up, get Up, get Up
Get Up out of that grave
If he did it for me, He can do it for You
The Testimony of Jesus
Is the Spirit of Prophesy
That means what he did for another
He can do it again
That means what he did for another
He can do it again
{ Get-Up, get Up, get Up
Get Up out of that grave
Get-Up, get Up, get Up
Get Up out of that grave } [Repeat]

He Picked me Up
Turned me Around
Placed my Feet on Solid Ground
I Thank the Master, I Thank the Savior,
Because he Healed my Heart
Changed my Name
Forever Free, I'm not the same
I Thank the Master
I Thank the Savior, I Thank GOD
