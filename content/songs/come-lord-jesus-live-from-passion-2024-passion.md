Come, Lord Jesus, come (Let Your glory go out, let Your glory go out)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Yes, Lord, we pray, we pray)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (It's the prayer and the song, the people of God sing)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Oh, sing)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Yes, Lord, yes Lord)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Spirit and the bride are praying today, we sing)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Yes, Lord, yes, Lord)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Lord, we long for the day, we long for the day)
Come, Lord Jesus, come
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Now think about your campus, think about your city, sing)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Think about your family, think about your friends, sing)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Think about the lost, think about the broken, sing, pray)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Oh Lord, all the captives, we sing)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Come and do what You do and set Your people free, sing)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Yes Lord, yes Lord)
Oh, come, Lord Jesus, come (One more time, keep going, keep going)
Oh, come, Lord Jesus, come
Oh, come, Lord Jesus, come
Come, Lord Jesus, come
Oh, come, Lord Jesus, come (Hear the roar, it's a holy roar in the place today, sing)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (All the desperate fall, the desperate, Lord)
Come, Lord Jesus, come (Oh, we pray)
Come, Lord Jesus, come
Come, Lord Jesus, come
