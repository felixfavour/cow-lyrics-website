Looking at the landscape of this broken life
Triage to decipher, if anything survived
The blast had quite an impact
Radius for miles
From the southern coast of Florida to the hills of Carolina
And everything has changed (Has changed)
When you're just a kid, words can take a toll
A word unfitly spoken, can steal an apple’s gold
Stranded in the fallout, wounded and alone
This is an emergency, is anybody home?
And everything has changed
Is this what growing up's supposed to look like?
Thought I'd be learning how to love, instead I’ve only learned to fight
And I was only trying to walk beside You
I guess I just got in the way
Sometimes all you need is the medicine of time
To lead you to the gold beneath the wreckage of our minds
'Cause I was not your failure and you were never mine
And we were made to see through much more sympathetic eyes
But everything has changed
