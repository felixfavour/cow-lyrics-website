I think your the prettiest girl
probably in the whole wide world
sometimes I watch you brush your hair
you don't even know I'm there , now I'm here
baby you don't want catch a cold
as your kneeling down and zipping up my coat
your always looking out for me
but your kiss upon my cheek
kiss me warmer than you know
   Chorus
I had never had to find out
whats like to be alone
and as far as I know Mom
is  just anthor word for home
They say I'm spitting image of
the one I look up too
and I just smile
cause anyone can see it true
I'm becoming me because of you,you
Chocolate ice cream melting down my chin
Ferries wheels goes round and round again
Happy Birthday   make a wish
Can it always stay like this
Finally kissed those training wheels good bye
But you've always made me feel like I could fly
An d i fall  and scrape my knee
The first one running after me is you
Saying ,"Give it one more try"
    Chorus
And every morning I could hear you talking to Jesus by your bed
Well, you pray for me and the strength to face the day ahead
And more than anything in this whole world,  I wana be like
So,I talk to Jesus
I smell cookies baking down the kitchen
And you will be calling me down any minute
So, I guess I would better go, I just wanted you to know
Anyone can see its true
I'm becoming me because of you
