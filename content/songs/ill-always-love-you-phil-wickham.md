In the world that is falling apart, I have found my hope
'Cause the power that brightens the stars brought to life my soul
Now I'm calling from rooftops shouting from mountain peaks
[Pre-Chorus]
You're everything to me
Forever I will tell You, yeah, I'll scream until it hurts
That I can't live without You, You are Heaven, and I am earth
And even from the moment that You saved my life, I knew
That I'll always love You
Hallelujah, the battle is won, let the church bells ring
Hallelujah, salvation is come and it came for me
What was lost now is found, and the heart that was bound is free
[Pre-Chorus]
Your grace amazes me
Forever I will tell You, yeah, I'll scream until it hurts
That I can't live without You, You are Heaven, and I am earth
And even from the moment that You saved my life, I knew
That I'll always love You
