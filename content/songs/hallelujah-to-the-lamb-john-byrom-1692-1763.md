VERSE 1
Lord I stand in the midst of a multitude
Of those from every tribe and tongue
We are Your people redeemed by Your blood
Rescued from death by Your love
There are no words
Good enough to thank You
There are no words to express my praise
But I will lift up my voice
And sing from my heart
With all of my strength

CHORUS
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
T o the Lamb
Hallelujah hallelujah
By the blood of Christ we stand
Every tongue every tribe
Every people every land
Giving glory giving honor
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God

VERSE 2
Lord we stand by grace in Your presence
Cleansed by the blood of the Lamb
We are Your children called by Your name
Humbly we bow and we pray
Release Your power
To work in us and through us
Till we are changed
To be more like You
Then all the nations will see
Your glory revealed
And worship You

CHORUS
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
To the Lamb
Hallelujah hallelujah
By the blood of Christ we stand
Every tongue every tribe
Every people every land
Giving glory giving honor
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God

BRIDGE
Every knee shall bow
Every tongue confess
That You are Lord of all

CHORUS
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
To the Lamb
Hallelujah hallelujah
By the blood of Christ we stand
Every tongue every tribe
Every people every land
Giving glory giving honor
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God

Giving praise unto the Lamb of God
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God
Jesus Christ Lamb of God
