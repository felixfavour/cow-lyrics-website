[Intro: Paul McClure]
Yes, our hearts adore You, oh
I just want Luke to play piano over you right now
Just raise your hands, close your eyes
Something happens when Luke plays the piano
Just let the peace of God fall on you right now
Just receive His love, receive His peace
[Instrumental]
[Chorus: Paul McClure]
So we breathe out Your praise
And we breathe in Your peace
Yes, we'll breathe out Your praise
And we'll breathe in Your peace
We don't have to make it so hard
We'll just love You, Jesus
We'll just give You our whole heart
And let You be God
[Chorus: Paul McClure]
So we'll breathe out Your praise
And we'll breathe in Your peace
Yes, we'll breathe out Your praise
And we'll breathe in Your peace
