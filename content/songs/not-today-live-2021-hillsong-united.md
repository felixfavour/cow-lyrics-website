Trouble won't throw me, won't break me
Won't scare me no more
Fear must have thought I was faithless
When it came for my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I got a song that will never die (Come on)
I know Your love is the reason why (So you sing)
I'll sing the night into the morning (Come on)
I'll sing the fear into Your praise
I'll sing my soul into Your presence
Whenever I say Your name (Shout it out)
So let the devil know not today (Woo)
Tell me did the enemy panic
As You took up that cross? (You know it was his worst day)
Tell me did the darkness cry mercy
As You rolled back that rock?
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know Your life is the life in mine
And I know Your love is the reason why (So we sing)
