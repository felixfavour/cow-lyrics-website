Bubbles! Bubbles!
Bubbles!
Yo, Bubbles, kick a beat!
I know people who say that I'm crazy
For believing in a place out there
(Tell 'em, girl!)
Darkness huffin', puffin', 'cause I continue
Tellin' people of the bright and fair
(Sing it!)
Jesus is and I know will always be
My bright and morning star
(Bright and morning star)
He has led, oh, I know that He has led
Me safely through thus far
People, what are we coming to
A generation with nothing more to do
Than sit and wonder where we're headin'
The future's not bleak, so why are you frettin'
Nothing else can make me happy
Nothing else can make me glad
No one else can make me happy
Or forget about the life I have
