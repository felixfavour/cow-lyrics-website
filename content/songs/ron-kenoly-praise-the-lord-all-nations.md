Jubilee (echo) (2x)
The time for jubilee is here (echo) (2x)
Praise the Lord all nations (echo)
Lift Him up all people (echo)
For His love to us is great
And His faithfulness forever (2x)
He has kept us by His mercy
We're surrounded by His love
There's a refuge in His presence
Gather 'round and praise The Lord of glory
Praise the Lord all nations (echo)
Lift Him up all people (echo)
For His love to us is great
And His faithfulness forever
He has kept us by His mercy
We're surrounded by His love
There's a refuge in His presence
Gather round and praise the Lord
Praise the Lord, Lord of glory
Praise the Lord (6x)
