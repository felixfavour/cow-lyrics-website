1 I have a Shepherd, One I love so well;
How He has blessed me tongue can never tell;
On the cross He suffered, shed His blood and died,
That I might ever in His love confide.

Refrain:
Following Jesus, ever day by day,
Nothing can harm me when He leads the way;
Darkness or sunshine, whate'er befallâ€”
Jesus, the Shepherd, is my All in All.

2 Pastures abundant doth His hand provide,
Still waters flowing ever at my side,
Goodness and mercy follow on my track,
With such a Shepherd nothing can I lack. [Refrain]

3 When I would wander from the path astray,
Then He will draw me back into the way;
In the darkest valley I need fear no ill,
For He, my Shepherd, will be with me still. [Refrain]

4. When labour's ended and the journey done
then he will lead me safely to my home
there i shall dwell in rapture sure
and sweet {round his feet with all the loved ones gathered}
