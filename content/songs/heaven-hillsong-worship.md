Comm'on if you love Jesus
Why don't you make some noise one more time
Comm'on
Holy
No measure knows Your worth
Face down
Where mercy finds me first
Comm'on
If you sought perfection
I'd die tryin' to reach it
But this broken heart is all You want
Comm'on
Singin' Holy
Heart like heaven
Singin' Holy
God almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singin' Holy is Your name
Singin' Holy is Your name
Own the sound forever
Heart and heaven together
Singin'Holy is your name
And if it lifts you higher
Burn in me your desire
A passion worthy of Your name
