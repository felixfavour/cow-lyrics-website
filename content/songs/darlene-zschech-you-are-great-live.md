Here I am safe, in the arms of my Saviour
Deep in my heart, You are with me
Found in Your love, I am lost in Your presence
I will not fear, You are with me
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Jesus You reign, You're the King of Glory
You are my victory song

You are great
Greater than the world, has ever seen
Higher than the heavens over me
You are great
No one in this world, can have Your fame
So let the earth declare Your holy Name
Jesus!
Here, at the cross, there is power to save us
Caught in Your beautiful grace
All; through the ages, eternally faithful
You are the Rock, that we stand on
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Yours is the Kingdom, that won't be shaken
Jesus, my victory song

You are great
Greater than the world, has ever seen
Higher than the heavens over me
You are great
No one in this world, can have Your fame
So let the earth declare Your holy Name
Jesus!
[Bridge]

We; stand in awe
We; stand in awe
Jesus
We; stand in awe
We; stand in awe
We; stand in awe
Jesus
We; stand in awe
We; stand in awe
We; stand in awe
Jesus
We; stand in awe
We; stand in awe
We; stand in awe
Jesus!
