[Instrumental]
In the quiet, in the stillness
I know that You are God
In the secret of Your presence
I know there I am restored
[Pre-Chorus 1]
When You call I won't refuse
And each new day again I'll choose
There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise
In the chaos, in confusion
I know You're sovereign still
In the moment of my weakness
You give me grace to do Your will
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And when You call I won't delay
And this my song through all my days
