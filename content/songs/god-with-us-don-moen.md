He walked where I walked
He walked where I walked
He stood where I stand
He stood where I stand
He felt what I feel
He felt what I feel
He understands
He understands

He knows my frailty
He knows my frailty
Shared my humanity
Shared my humanity
Tempted in every way
Tempted in every way
Yet without sin
Yet without sin

God with us
So close to us
God with us
Emmanuel

God with us
So close to us
God with us
Emmanuel
Emmanuel

One of a hated race
One of a hated race
Stung by the prejudice
Stung by the prejudice
Suffering injustice
Suffering injustice
Yet he forgives
Yet he forgives

Wept for my wasted years
Wept for my wasted years
Paid for my wickedness
Paid for my wickedness
He died in my place
He died in my place
That I might live
That I might live

God with us
So close to us
God with us
Emmanuel

God with us
So close to us
God with us
Emmanuel
Emmanuel

God with us
Emmanuel
