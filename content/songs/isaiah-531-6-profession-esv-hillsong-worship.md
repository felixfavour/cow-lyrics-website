[Isaiah 53:1-6 (ESV)]
Who has believed what He has heard from us?
And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
For He grew up before Him like a young plant
And a root out of dry ground
He had no form or majesty that we should look at Him
And no beauty that we should desire Him
He was despised and rejected by men
A Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief
And as one from whom men hide their faces
He was despised and we esteemed Him not
Surеly He has borne our griefs
And carriеd our sorrows
Yet we esteemed him stricken
Smitten by God and afflicted
But He was pierced for our transgressions
He was crushed for our iniquities
Upon Him was the chastisement that brought us peace
And with His wounds, we are healed
All we like sheep have gone astray
We have turned every one to His own way
And the Lord has laid on Him
The iniquity of us all
