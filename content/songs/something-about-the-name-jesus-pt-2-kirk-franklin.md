Gather 'round and let me tell you 'bout Jesus
See this world, they don't know nothing 'bout Jesus
You can try but there's nobody like Jesus
Son of man, Son of God, Jesus
Springtime, summer or fall
Wherever you are, you can just call
The sweetest name that will never change is
Jesus, Jesus
In the world, things have changed
Look around, all I see is pain
And through it all one thing's the same
I still believe the power of Your name
I was sick deep in my soul
I needed someone to make me whole
I let Jesus take control
You see, I'm not crazy and I want you all to know
Gather 'round and let me tell you 'bout Jesus
See this world, they don't know nothing 'bout Jesus
You can try but there's nobody like Jesus
Son of man, Son of God, Jesus
Springtime, summer or fall
Wherever you are, you can just call
The sweetest name that will never change is
Jesus, Jesus
