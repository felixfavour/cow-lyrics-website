[Chorus]
He put a new song in my mouth
A hymn of praise unto our God
Many will see and fear
And put their trust in the Lord
He put a new song in my mouth
A hymn of praise unto our God
Many will see and fear
And put their trust in the Lord
As we worship the Lord
In spirit and in truth
May the voice of the Lord
Be heard in all the Earth
He put a new song in my mouth
A hymn of praise unto our God
Many will see and fear
And put their trust in the Lord
He put a new song in my mouth
A hymn of praise unto our God
Many will see and fear
And put their trust in the Lord
