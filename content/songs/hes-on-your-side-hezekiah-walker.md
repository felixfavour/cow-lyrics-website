Troubles come and troubles go
Long nights, me pacing the floor
When will these problems ever end
Where can I find a friend;
For Jesus Christ will abide, He's on Your side
Sometimes dark clouds fill my sky
People don't always know why
That's when I hear down in my heart
Jesus, my Lord won't depart
For He's always been my guide, He's on my side
He's on your side
He will be with you in trouble
All your prayers He will not deny
He will hear your faintest cry
He's on your side
Love stays, it will never go away;
He'll stay, nobody but Jesus, I know
