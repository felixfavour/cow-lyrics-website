KIRK FRANKLIN:
FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT ARE GOING THROUGH
I WANT YOU TO WIPE EVERY TEAR FROM YOU EYE
CAUSE JESUS SAID HE'LL MEET US SOMEDAY
DOWN BY THE RIVERSIDE
CAN I GET A WITNESS UP IN HERE
CHOIR:
IT'S FRIDAY AND MY BILLS ARE DUE
MY 3 MONTH OLD BABY NEED SOME SHOES
CAN'T YOU FEEL WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH
CLOCK ON THE WALL KEEPS TICKING TOCKING
NO STOPPING AND SOMEBODY'S KNOCKING
ON MY DOOR TELLING ME TO GO
BROTHER I CAN'T TAKE NO MORE
SO WIT MY KNEES I HIT THE FLOOR
AND SAY HELP ME JESUS, HELP ME JESUS
CHORUS:
LET'S GO DOWN BY THE RIVERSIDE
LEAVE YOUR PROBLEMS ALL BEHIND
YOU CAN REST TOUBLED MINDS
DOWN BY....
THE RIVERSIDE
KIRK FRANKLIN:
I DON'T THINK YOU HEARD ME THE FIRST
SO THEN WHY DON'T I SAY IT ONE MORE TIME
EVERYBODY JESUS IS GOING TO MEET US DOWN THERE
BY THE RIVERSISE
ONE TIME FOR THE HOLY MIND
