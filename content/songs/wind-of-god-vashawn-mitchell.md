The wind of God is blowing my way
The wind of God is blowing my way
The wind of God is blowing my way
The wind of God is blowing my way
I don't know where it's coming from
But it's blowing in my direction
There's something about the wind of God
That changes everything
And it's blowing my way
Blowing my way
It's blowing my way
I feel the wind blowing (blowing my way)
Oceans are lifted and mountains destroyed
When the wind of God blows
The enemy's defeated and dry bones live
When the wind of God blows
All of my problems are carried away
When the wind of God blows, yea
Everything will be ok
When the wind of God blows
Oceans are lifted and mountains destroyed
When the wind, wind of God blows, hey
The enemy's defeated and dry bones live
When the wind of God blows
All of my problems are carried away
When the wind of God blows
And everything will be ok
When the wind of God blows
And it's blowing my way
Blowing my way (Can we sing that?)
It's blowing my way (Oh God it is)
Blowing my way
Can you feel the wind blowing
Can you feel the wind blowing
Can you feel the wind blowing
The wind is blowing
And I feel breakthrough
The wind is blowing
And I feel miracles
The wind is blowing
I feel, I feel breakthrough
The wind is blowing
And I feel, I feel miracles
Sing Halle, Hallelujah
Halle, Hallelujah
God will love you
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Thank you for the wind
Thank you for the wind
The wind of healing (thank you)
The wind of blessing (for the wind)
The wind of promotion (thank you)
The wind of elevation (for the wind)
The wind of change (thank you)
Whatever it is (for the wind)
That you ask in his name
It shall be (thank you)
It shall be (for the wind)
It shall be (thank you)
Shall be (for the wind)
Lord (thank you)
Tell them (for the wind)
Unto the power of your own tongue (thank you for the wind)
We believe, and we receive it
We believe it, and we receive it
Whatever I need is coming my way
Whatever I need is coming my way (You say it!)
Whatever I need is coming my way
Whatever I need is coming my way
Whatever I need is coming my way
I can feel it moving (whatever I need)
I can feel it changing (is coming my way)
I can feel it coming (whatever I need)
I can feel it coming (is coming my way)
I can feel it shifting (whatever I need)
Whatever I need (is coming my way)
Whatever I need (whatever I need)
Whatever I need (is coming my way)
Whatever I need (whatever I need)
Whatever I need (is coming my way)
Is coming my way
