They say this mountain can't be moved
They say these chains will never break
But they don't know You like we do
There is power in Your name
We've heard that there is no way through
We've heard the tide will never change
They haven't seen what You can do
There is power in Your name
So much power in Your name
Move the unmovable
Break the unbreakable
God we believe
God we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God we believe
God we believe for it
We know that hope is never lost (oh)
For there is still an empty grave
God we believe no matter what
There is power in Your name
So much power in Your name
Move the unmovable
Break the unbreakable
God we believe
God we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God we believe
God we believe for it (hey)
You are the way
When there seems to be no way
We trust in You
God You have the final say, yeah
You are the way
When there seems to be no way (yes You are)
We trust in You
God You have the final say
(You are the final say)
Move the unmovable
Break the unbreakable
God we believe
God we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God we believe
God we believe for it
God we believe
God we believe for it
