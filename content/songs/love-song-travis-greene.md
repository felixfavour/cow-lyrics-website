Music starts, dancing begins
You grab my heart and pull it in
Closer to Your heartbeat is the tempo now
Here we are, no one is left
The two of us and nothing else
Ever compares to this moment
[Chorus: Travis Greene]
I love to sing to You
There is nothing else that I would rather do
Everything that I desire is found in You
Oh, Jesus
Oh, Jesus You are my love song
The times have changed, sound has evolved
But You remain unmoved at all
By anything I've done to You
So I'm coming back with a voicе
Don't need a stage
To open up, so much to say
I will let my hеart do the talking
[Chorus: MDSN]
I love to sing to You
There is nothing else that I would rather do
Everything that I desire is found in You
Oh, Jesus
Oh, Jesus You are my love song
