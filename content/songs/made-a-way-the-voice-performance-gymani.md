You made a way
Don't know how but you did it
You made a way
Standing here not knowing how we'll get through this test
But holding onto faith you know best
Nothing can catch you by surprise
You've got this figured out and you're watching us
And you made a way
When our backs were against the wall
And it looked as if it was over (oh woah)
You made a way
And we're standing here
Only because you made a way
You made a way
Now we're here
Looking back on where we come from
Because of you and nothing we've done
To desеrve the love and mеrcy you've shown
But your grace was strong enough to pick us up
*
Now everybody say You made a way (you made a way)
When our backs were (When our backs were against the wall)
And it looked as if (And it looked as if it was over)
Lord (You made a way)
And we're standing here (And we're standing here)
Only because you (Only because you made a way)
