Been ostracized for 12 years
I'm used to being alone
Spent everything i had
And now it's gone
I'm used to being put down
My issues tell it all
My only hope is anchored
In this fall
If I could just touch the hem of His garment
I know I'd be made whole
If I could just press my way through this madness
His love would heal my soul
If only one touch
So many people calling
How could He ever know
That just a brush of Him
Would stop the flow
Ife he knew would He rebuke me
Or shame me to the crowd
Well I'm desperate 'cause it's never or it's now
