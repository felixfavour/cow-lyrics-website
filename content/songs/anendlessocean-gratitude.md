Look will I fathom
Or comprehend
This Love You give
Tell me where do I begin
Look at my hands up
Kin ma ke bi Cherubim
(And let me cry like cherubim)
Tabi Seraphim
(Or seraphim)
Lowo oh
(At this moment)
Lowo Lowo ti mo wa yi oh
(At this moment I'm at)
Iwo ni mo fi shasho bora
(You are my blanket)
Your mercy, your goodness
Ni mo man fi gara
(Is what I use to boast)
And I feel it
Oh I see it
Gratitude is it
And So with everything in me
I say
Eshe oh
(Thank you)
