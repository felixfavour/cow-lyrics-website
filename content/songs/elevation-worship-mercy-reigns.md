Solo1:
My God is strong enough to raise me from the grave,
Your love is great enough to take away my shame,
Your mercy reigns...
(instrumentals)
My God is making new the wreckage of my heart,
Your hand is reaching down to pull me from the dark,
Chorus:
Your mercy reigns,
Your mercy covers me.
Your grace Jesustains,
Your grace is all I need.
Solo 2:
Your spirit is my strength to overcome the past,
I set my eyes on you and found the grace that lasts,
Chorus:
Your mercy reigns...
Bridge:
I'm forgiven, washed inside the love that never lets go,
Never let go...
I'm forgiven, washed inside the love that never lets go,
Never let go...
Back to chorus
My God is strong enough to raise me from the grave.
