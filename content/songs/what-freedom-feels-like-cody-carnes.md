Sunrise
You brought the sun into my dark night
Wide-eyed
You brought the color to my black and white
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooooo, oo-ooo-oo, ooooo
Feel like I'm living for the first time
Ooooo, oo-ooo-oo, ooooo
And now I'm dancing in Your light
This is what freedom feels like
This is what freedom feels like
This is what freedom feels like
This is what freedom feels like, feels like
Landslide
Your love came crashing into my life, ooo-ooo
High tide
Your grace is washing every wrong right
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooooo, oo-ooo-oo, ooooo
Feel like I'm living for the first time
Ooooo, oo-ooo-oo, ooooo
And now I'm dancing in Your light
