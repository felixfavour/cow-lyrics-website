Dominion,
You have won the victory,
You have set the captives free, hallelujah,

You have healed my broken heart.
you have made me new again,
Hallelujah.

Dominion is mine,
Dominion is mine,
Dominion is mine.

Your power is mine,
Your power is mine,
Your power is mine.

Lord, I am yours,
And you are mine,
We will never never be separated,
Never never be separated.

Dominion is mine,
Dominion is mine,
Dominion is mine.

Your victory is mine,
Your victory is mine,
Your victory is mine.


Dance in the Holy Ghost,
Proclaim your victory now.

Dominion is mine, Your glory is mine,
Your favour is mine, Your victory is mine.
