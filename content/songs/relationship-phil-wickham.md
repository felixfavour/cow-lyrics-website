[Intro]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
I know the One who made the stars
I met Him on the bathroom floor
When everything was torn apart
Didn't know what I was livin' for
I almost gave up
I almost gave up
You met me in the mess I made
And told me I was meant for more
You pulled me out of my mistakes
And led me through that open door
That's when I woke up
That's when I woke up, yeah
My sin is gone and forgiven
That shame at the bottom of the sea
You didn't come for religion
You want a relationship with me
And I found the gates of heaven
Took me a little while but now I see
You didn't come for religion
You want a relationship with me
Yeah, You want a relationship with me
