He's got it all in control
God's got it all in control
He's put that reassurance
Way down in my soul
He's got it all in control
I've put my life in His hands
I've put my life in His hands
So every road I walk down
I know it's in His plan
'Cause I've put my life in His hands
He holds the stars in the sky
He holds the land back from the sea
If He can do all of that
Surely he can take good care
Of you and me, yeah
He's got it all in control
God's got it all in control
He's put that reassurance
Way down in my soul
He's got it all in control
God's got it all in control
He's got it all in control
He's put that reassurance
Way down in my soul
He's got it all in control
