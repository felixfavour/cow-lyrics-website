ti:6 Onye]
(Instrumentals)
If you had allowed
The enemy to strike me down
Onye kam nga akoro
Onye kam nga akoro
If you had allowed
Shame all over me
Onye kam nga akoro
Onye kam nga akoro
Agam ebuli gi elu (4x)
Papa mu oh
Daddy mu oh
Well it's been many years and months
But you never fail
You never change
If you never died
For me on calvary
Onye kam nga akoro
Onye kam nga akoro
And if you had allowed
My life to waste away
Onye kam nga akoro
Who do i run to
You've been good to me
All the time
In the rain and summer time
Even in the darkest hour
You've always been there
This life you gave to me
That i'm giving it back to you
So do what you want with it
Do what you want with it
Agam ebuli gi elu oh
Agam ebuli gi elu oh
Papa
Papa
Agam ebuli gi elu oh
Agam ebuli gi elu oh
Papa
Papa
