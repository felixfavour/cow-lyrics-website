Everyone hurts, and goes through pain
Whatevers first, it feels the same
Be young or poor, old age or fame
Know this for sure, everyone hurts, we all feel pain
Everyone hurts, everyone falls
We let love in, still heartbreak calls
Tell me how much can my soul take
We make mistakes, we hurt we need amazing grace
So we pray tonight, that you don't get weak
And please pray that I, don't forget what I believe
Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work
Pray until He heals the hurt
I trust god will heal the hurt
Everyone hurts, we all ask why
Sinner or saint, everyone tries
Life cuts so deep, feels like your dying
No cross no crown can't give up now please heal tonight
So we pray tonight, that you don't get weak
And please pray that I, don't forget what I believe
Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work
Pray until He heals the hurt
I trust God will heal the hurt
