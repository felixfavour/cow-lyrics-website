The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice
He wraps himself in Light, and darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
Age to age,He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end
The Godhead Three in One
Father, Spirit and Son
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
[Bridge]
Name above all names, worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing how great is our God
Name above all names, You are worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing how great is our God
