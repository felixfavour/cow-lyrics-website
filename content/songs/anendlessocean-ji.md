yea how can I hide from your goodness
Tell me How could i hide from your love
Boyensshemi yea i need you the closest
It's unforgettable,  I'm reminded  who you are
When I'm up you're my spiral
you're my backbone my spinal
me I do everything  you say
cause your every word is final you're my rock you're  my solid yea
you're my pillow my pilot
I mean i look at what u made
And everything is special.
Ji ji Mo ji lowuro
you're the one i call
lekan o gbemi sokan
O'n gbo
I need you, only you in each and every way
on each and every day

On the matter of who you are!
When I'm up you're my spiral
you're my backbone my spinal
me I do everything  you say
cause your every word is final you're my rock you're  my solid yea
you're my pillow my pilot
I mean i look at what u made
And everything is special.
