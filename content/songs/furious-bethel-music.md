Nothing can tear us from
The grip of His mighty love
We've only glimpsed, His vast affection
Heard whispers of, His heart and passion
It's pouring down
His love is deep, His love is wide, and it covers us
His love is fierce, His love is strong, it is furious
His love is sweet, His love is wild, and it's waking hearts to life
The Father loves and sends His son
The Son lays down His life for all
He lavishes His love upon us
He calls us now, His sons and daughters
He's reaching out
His love is deep, His love is wide, and it covers us
His love is fierce, His love is strong, it is furious
His love is sweet, His love is wild, and it's waking hearts to life
His love is deep, His love is wide, and it covers us
His love is fierce, His love is strong, it is furious
His love is sweet, His love is wild, and it's waking hearts to life
