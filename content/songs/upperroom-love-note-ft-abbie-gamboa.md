I sent my only son
To be with whom I love
You are all I want
The wonder of it all
From havens gates
You catch my gaze
And I love you
In the morning
In the noontime
In the evening
You're my one thing
You're my dearest
Here's my love note
Can you hear it?
A dinner for two
Just me and you
Let's take some time
To sit down in dawn
I broke my bread
And poured out my wine
I did what it took
To make you my bride
I'm bringing you back to the garden
Back were it all started
All of your sins have been parted
Now we just get to be together
Now we just get to be together
Now we just get to be together
Now we just get to be together
Now we just get to be together
And I love you
In the morning
In the noontime
In the evening
You're my one thing
You're my dearest
Here's my love note
Can you hear it?
And I love you
In the morning
In the noontime
In the evening
You're my one thing
You're my dearest
Here's my love note
Can you hear it?
Can you hear?
Do you hear
Writing words over you
Singing songs over you
I'm above you
I'm beneath you
I'm before you
I'm behind you
I'm above you
I'm beneath you
I'm before you
I'm behind you
I'm above you
I'm beneath you
I'm before you
I'm behind you
I'm above you
I'm beneath you
I'm before you
I'm behind you
I'm all around you
I'm all around you
Baby I'm all around you
I'm all around you
I'm above you
I'm beneath you
I'm before you
I'm behind you
I'm above you
I'm beneath you
I'm before you
I'm behind you
I'm above you
I'm beneath you
I'm before you
I'm behind you
I'm above you
I'm beneath you
I'm before you
I'm behind you
I'm all around you
I'm all around you
I'm all around you
I'm all around you
And I love you
In the morning
In the noontime
In the evening
You're my one thing
You're my dearest
Here's my love note
Can you hear it?
And I love you
In the morning
In the noontime
In the evening
You're my one thing
You;re my dearest
Here's my love note
