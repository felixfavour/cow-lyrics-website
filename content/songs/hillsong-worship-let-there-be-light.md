There's no darkness in your ways
There's no question in ur mind
God of Almighty
God of mercy
There's no hiding from ur face
There's no striving in grace
God of mercy
God Almighty
let there be light
open the eyes of the blind
purify our heart to your fire
breathe in us we pray
Jesus have ur way
There's no borders in ur love
no division in ur heart
God of heaven
God of freedom
There's no taking back the cross
No regret in what it cost
God of freedom
God of heaven
let there be light
open the eyes of the blind
purify our heart to your fire
breathe in us we pray
Jesus have ur way
let there be light
open our eyes to ur heart
desperate just to know who u are
shine in us we pray
Jesus have ur way
Good news embracing the poor
comfort for all those who mourn
For the broken hearted
We sing louder
release from prison and shame
oppression turning to praise
For every captive
sing louder
restoring sight to the blind
breaking the curse of the night
For those in darkness
sing louder
proclaiming freedom for all
this is the day of the Lord
beauty for ashes
let there be light
open the eyes of the blind
purify our heart to your fire
 breathe in us we pray
Jesus
let there be light
open our eyes to ur heart
desperate just to know who you are
shine in us we pray
let the light that shine above
become the light that shine in us
there's no darkness in ur way
so have your way
