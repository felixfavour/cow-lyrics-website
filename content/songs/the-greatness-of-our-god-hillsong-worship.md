Give me eyes to see
More of who You are
May what I behold
Still my anxious heart
Take what I have known
And break it all apart
For You my God, are greater still
No sky contains
No doubt restrains
All You are
The greatness of our God
I spend my life to know
And I'm far from close
To all You are
The greatness of our God
Give me grace to see
Beyond this moment here
To believe that there
Is nothing left to fear
That You alone are high above it all
For You my God, are greater still
No sky contains
No doubt restrains
All You are
The greatness of our God
I spend my life to know
And I'm far from close
To all You are
The greatness of our God
