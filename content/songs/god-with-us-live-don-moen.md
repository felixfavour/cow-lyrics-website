He walked where I walked
He stood where I stand
He felt what I feel
He understands

He knows my frailty
Shared my humanity
Tempted in every way
Yet without sin

God with us!
So close to us
God with us
Emmanuel

God with us!
So close to us
God with us
Emmanuel
Emmanuel

One of a hated race
Stung by the prejudice
Suffering injustice
Yet He forgives!

Wept for my wasted years
He paid for my wickedness
He died in my place
That I might live

God with us!
So close to us
God with us
Emmanuel

God with us!
So close to us
God with us
Emmanuel 
Emmanuel
