Dear God, I've been trying awful hard to make you proud of me
But it seems, the harder that I try, all the harder it becomes
And I feel like giving up, most of the time
Dear God, I've been chasing their approval and it's killing me
And I know the more I try to prove, all the less I have to show
And I'm stuck inside my head, most of the time
But if I pray a little harder, if I follow all the rules
I wonder could I ever be enough
Cos I try, and try
Just to fall back down again
And I ask myself why do I try to chase the wind
I should lean into the mystery
Maybe hope is found in a melody
So I wanna try again
Oh I'm gonna try again
Dear child, I hope you know how much I love you and am proud of you
Please believe, the thoughts I have for you will never change or fade away
When you felt like giving up, I never did
Cos I'm not scared of imperfections or the questions in your head
Know that you have always been enough
Cos you try, and try
And I saw you wrestle with
Every how and every why
I was right there listening
So just fall into the mystery
I'll meet you in the melody
Try, just to try again
My child would you try again?
My child you can love again.
