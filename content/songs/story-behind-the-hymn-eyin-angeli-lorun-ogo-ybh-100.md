"Eyin Angeli Lorun Ogo - YBH 100"

The Hymn "Angels from the Realms of Glory" was written by Henry Thomas Smart and popularly tuned by James Montgomery.

James Montgomery was born on November 4, 1771, in Scotland. 

His father, John Montgomery, was a Moravian minister, and his mother, Mary Montgomery, was a devout Christian. James was the second of five children, and his family moved to England when he was a young boy.

Montgomery received his early education at the Moravian school in Fulneck, Yorkshire.

He later attended the Moravian seminary in London, where he studied theology and prepared for the ministry. 

However, Montgomery's interests lay more in literature and poetry than in theology, and he eventually left the seminary to pursue a career in writing.

Montgomery wrote "Angels from the Realms of Glory" in 1816, specifically for the Christmas services at the Sheffield parish church. The hymn was inspired by the biblical account of the angels' appearance to the shepherds in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 2:8-14). 

Montgomery's hymn was meant to be a celebration of the angels' joyful announcement of Jesus' birth.
