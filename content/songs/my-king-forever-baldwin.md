You gave Your life for mine
Nailed to the cross You crucified
all of my sin and shame
It was washed by Your mercy

You are the treasure I find
My reason for living 
so let my life become an offering
to the One who is worthy

All praise to the Lord most high
All praise to the One who saved my life
All praise to Jesus Christ
High KIng of heaven, my King forever

You stormed the gates of my heart
the veil in between was torn apart
now You hold the keys to the grave
'cause You bring things to life
You roll stones away

All praise to the Lord most high
All praise to the One who saved my life
All praise to Jesus Christ
High KIng of heaven, my King forever

I lift my hands up lay my whole life down
my whole life down before You
I lift my hands up lay my whole life down
my whole life now is for You
(repeat)

All praise to the Lord most high
All praise to the One who saved my life
All praise to Jesus Christ
High KIng of heaven, my King forever
(repeat)
