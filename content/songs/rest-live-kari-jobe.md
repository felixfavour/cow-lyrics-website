I see it clear now
You're all around me
In every little thing
Where can I go now
To flee Your presence?
There's nowhere You won't be
[Pre-Chorus]
To hear Your voice
To call You friend
To know Your thoughts
How rare, how beautiful
You're with me here
I feel You breathing
You're closer than I thought was possible
So I'll rest right here with You
So I'll rest right here with You
Oh with You, with You
Breathtaking wonder
In every color
You're showing off to me
You come likе thunder
Then a gentlе whisper
You're found in everything
