There's a table that You've prepared for me
In the presence of my enemies
It's Your body and Your blood You've shed for me
This is how I fight my battles
There's a table that You've prepared for me
In the presence of my enemies
It's Your body and Your blood You've shed for me
This is how I fight my battles
And I believe You've overcome
And I will lift my song of praise for what You've done
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how
In the valley I know that You're with me
And surely Your goodness and mercy follow me
So my weapons are praise and thanksgiving
This is how I fight my battles
And I believe You've overcome
And I will lift my song of praise for what You've done
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
This is how I fight my battles
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
It may look like I'm surrounded but I'm surrounded by You
