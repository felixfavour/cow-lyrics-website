[Intro: Chandler Moore]
I know You'll come through
This mountain is moving
I fix my eyes on You
If You said it, You’ll do it
[Pre-Chorus]
Because You are God, no matter the odds
The outcome is always the same
The words on the pages, the promise You made us
Still have the final say
You will make a way, You always make a way
You will make a way, You always make a way
I won't fear tomorrow
'Cause You're already in it
My hope and my future
Is already written
[Pre-Chorus]
Because You are God
No matter the odds
The outcome is always the same
The words on thе pages
The promise You madе us
Still have the final say
