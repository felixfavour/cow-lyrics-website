No more tears
And no more fears
Ever since I met the Holy One
Yes He is so sweet
And He comforts me
I'm gonna take Him wherever I go
There's a sweet, sweet spirit
In this place
And I'm going to take that spirit
With me every day
There's a sweet, sweet spirit
In this place
And I'm going to take that spirit
With me every day
There's been a change
A change in me
I've got a new attitude
A whole different personality
And it's you, Spirit
And I want the world to know
I'm not at all acting funny
Because of You I have a spiritual glow
There's a sweet, sweet spirit
In this place
And I'm going to take that spirit
With me every day
There's a sweet, sweet spirit
In this place
And I'm going to take that spirit
With me every day
There's something about Your spirit
There's something about Your spirit
There's something about Your spirit
There's something about Your spirit
I'm going to take it
I'm going to take it
I'm going to take it
I'm going to take it
I'm going to take it
I'm going to take it
I'm going to take it
I'm going to Every day!
I'm going to take it
I'm going to take it
I'm going to take it
I'm going to -- Every day!
I'm going to take it
I'm going to Every day!
I'm going to take it
I'm going to Every day!
