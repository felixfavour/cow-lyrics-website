I'll wait for You to come
I'll wait for You to come
'Cause when I'm with You Lord
It always leaves me wanting more
Here's our praise, You can dwell within
[Chorus: Brandon Lake]
Come again, come again
Let the glory in
I'm open, I'm open
Come again
Let the glory in
I'm open, I'm open
I'll wait for You to come (Yeah)
I'll wait (Yeah) for You to come
('Cause when I'm with)
When I'm with You Lord
It always leaves me wanting more
(Say it)
Here's our praise, You can dwell within
[Chorus: Chandler Moore & Brandon Lake]
(Come) Come again
(Come again) come again
(Lеt the glory in) Let the glory in
(I'm opеn) I'm open, I'm open
(Oh come again) Come again
(Jesus come again) Let the glory in
(I'm open) I'm open, (I'm open) I'm open
(I'm open) I'm open, I'm open
