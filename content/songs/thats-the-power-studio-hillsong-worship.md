There's a name that levels mountains
And carves out highways through the sea
And I've seen its power unravel battles
Right in front of me (Yeah)
Oh, there's a faith that stands defiant
Sends Goliath to his knees
I've seen His praise unravel shackles
Right off my feet
That's the power of Your name
Just a mention makes a way
Giants fall and strongholds break, and there is healing
And that's the power that I claim
It's the same that rolled the grave
And there's no power like the mighty name of Jesus
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah!
There's a hope that calls out courage
In the furnace unafraid
The kind of daring expectation
That every prayer I make is on an empty grave
