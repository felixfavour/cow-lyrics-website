[Chorus: David Binion]
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
Heaven is on the move
Jesus is on the throne
No other nations rage
I know God is in control
His Kingdom is coming now
Changing the atmosphere
Rolling in like a cloud
The King of glory is here
[Chorus: Nicole Binion]
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Here comes the glory of the Lord
Sweeping in the room
