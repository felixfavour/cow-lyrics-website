I was sink­ing deep in sin, Far from the peace­ful shore, Very deep­ly stained with­in, Sinking to rise no more, But the Mas­ter of the sea, Heard my des­pair­ing cry, From the wa­ters lift­ed me,
Now safe am I.

Love lift­ed me! Love lift­ed me! When no­thing else could help Love lift­ed me!
Love lift­ed me! Love lift­ed me! When no­thing else could help Love lift­ed me!

All my heart to Him I give, Ever to Him I’ll cling In His blessed pre­sence live,
Ever His prais­es sing, Love so migh­ty and so true, Merits my soul’s best songs, Faithful, lov­ing serv­ice too, To Him be­longs.

Love lift­ed me! Love lift­ed me! When no­thing else could help Love lift­ed me!
Love lift­ed me! Love lift­ed me! When no­thing else could help Love lift­ed me!

Souls in dan­ger look above, Jesus com­plete­ly saves, He will lift you by His love, Out of the an­gry waves. He’s the Mas­ter of the sea, Billows His will ob­ey,
He your Sav­ior wants to be, Be saved to­day.

Love lift­ed me! Love lift­ed me! When no­thing else could help Love lift­ed me!
Love lift­ed me! Love lift­ed me! When no­thing else could help Love lift­ed me!
