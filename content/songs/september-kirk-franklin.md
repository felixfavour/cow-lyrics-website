[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Whoa, it's your boy
Let's go
This is a tribute right here
And it's about to go down!
Do you remember, when it was like September?
Before you grew cold like December
And all you saw were cloudy days
And I remember, that day when you surrendered
You stopped hurting cause you remembered
The season it won't last always
Ba de ya, tell me you remember
Ba de ya, when your heart felt like September
Still had the joy, and God was just a prayer away
[Post-Chorus]
Ba doo doop ba doop, ba doo doop ba doop
(I can see clearly now)
Ba doo doop ba doop, ba doo doop ba doop
(The sun is much brighter now)
Ba doo doop ba doop
(The season it won't last always)
