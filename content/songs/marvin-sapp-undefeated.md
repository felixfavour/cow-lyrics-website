People infatuated with their own thing
Some self proclaim they're the GOAT
History provides that my God's the One
No losses, he's won the most
Undefeated Champion
Be seated on Your Throne
Ruler, Redeemer
Savior of the World
Who else could take
The sting of death as a man
Resist temptation like mine
You've proven Your power
And showed us the way
So we could win every time
Undefeated Champion
Be seated on Your Throne
Ruler, Redeemer
Savior of the World
Undefeated Champion (undefeated)
Be seated on Your Throne (be seated on Your Throne)
Ruler, Redeemer (Ruler, Redeemer)
Savior of the World (Savior of the World)
Who is Greater than our God?
Nothing can defeat our God
So rise up, Champion
We're victorious
Who is Greater than our God?
Nothing can defeat our God (nothing can defeat our God)
Rise up, Champion (rise up, Champion)
We're victorious (we're victorious)
Who is greater? (Who is greater then our God?)
Nothing can, nothing can defeat our God (nothing can defeat our God)
Rise up, rise up (rise up, Champion)
We're victorious (we're victorious)
Say it again, say
Who is Greater than our God? (say it again, say)
Nothing can defeat our God
Rise up, rise up (rise up, Champion)
We're victorious (we're victorious)
I lost my jam
But I didn't loose my joy
(You reign)
I have hope in You
Because I have You as my Source
(You reign)
Said nothing can stop You
Nothing can defeat You
You reign (You reign)
Said You Reign (You reign)
King of Glory (King of Glory)
(You reign) said You reign
King of Glory (You reign)
Adonai (You reign)
Healing the sick and the broken
Undefeated Champion
Be seated on Your Throne
Ruler, Redeemer
Savior of the World
Undefeated Champion
Be seated on Your Throne
Ruler, Redeemer
Savior of the World
