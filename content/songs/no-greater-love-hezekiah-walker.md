No greater love than this, oh no
No greater love than this, but from the Lord
Love as sweet as candy
Sweeter than the honey in the honeycomb
And love is more than money
Love is more than silver and gold
No greater love is this, oh no
No greater love is this but from the Lord
Love will never leave you
It will always be there by your side
And love will not forsake you
It will guide you through the darkest night
No greater love is this, oh no
No greater love is this but from the Lord
Try Him, try the Lord
Oh, try Him
Try Him, try the Lord
Oh, try Him, try Him
