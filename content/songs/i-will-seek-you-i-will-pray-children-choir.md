I will seek you I will pray
I will fast to know your will, 
I will seek you, seek you every day
I will seek you I will pray, 
I will fast to know your will, so let your will be done.

Daniel an exile, worked with the king
He fasted and prayed devoting his time to the books
He stood in the gap for the land
To free them from captivity
By seeking the face of God

I will seek you I will pray
I will fast to know your will, 
I will seek you, seek you every day
I will seek you I will pray, 
I will fast to know your will, so let your will be done.

Esther rose up as a queen in the land 
She fasted and prayed knowing the adversary’s plan
She won victory for her people
She saved them from annihilation 
By seeking the face of God

I will seek you I will pray
I will fast to know your will, 
I will seek you, seek you every day
I will seek you I will pray, 
I will fast to know your will, so let your will be done.

My Lord and saviour you fasted and prayed 
for 40 days seeking the will of God
That you will achieve God’s plan
To save man kind from sin and death
By seeking strength from God

I will seek you I will pray
I will fast to know your will, 
I will seek you, seek you every day
I will seek you I will pray, 
I will fast to know your will, so let your will be done.

I have decided to walk in your ways 
To live for you and do what your will demands
I’m willing to learn your ways.
To fast and pray and seek your face
I’ll do  your will Oh Lord.

I will seek you I will pray
I will fast to know your will, 
I will seek you, seek you every day
I will seek you I will pray, 
I will fast to know your will, so let your will be done.

I will fast and pray, 
I will fast and pray, 
I will learn the discipline 2x
