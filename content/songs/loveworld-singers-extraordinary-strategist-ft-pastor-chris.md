you are my helper
In the time of trouble
My extraordinary strategist yeah
You're the lifter of my head and keeper
You're my pride and joy forever
Extraordinary strategist
You are for me
There's no helper
That's greater than you
The reason why am flying high
When contrary wind comes against me
I climb the winds like an eagle
High above clouds of troubles
Nothing can bring me down
No, no, no
I mount up my wings and fly
Over mountains of fears and doubts
Above situations and circumstances
That try to bring me down
But like an eagle
Am stable and strong
In dark clouds
When contrary wind comes against me
I climb the winds like an eagle
High above clouds of troubles
Nothing can bring me down
No, no, no
I mount up my wings and fly
Over mountains of fears and doubts
Above situations and circumstances
That try to bring me down
But like an eagle
Am stable and strong
In dark clouds
I know my way in the skies
I live above all
With the extraordinary strategist
Holy Spirit
The extraordinary strategist
My strengthener and my advocate you are
Holy Spirit
The extraordinary strategist
My standby, guide and teacher Lord you are
Strategist 3x
The extraordinary strategist
Strategist 2x
The extraordinary strategist
The extraordinary 4x
The extraordinary strategist
