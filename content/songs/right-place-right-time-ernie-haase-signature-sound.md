It's the right place and the right time
We're meeting in obedience to Your Word
In the right place at the right time
Not a thing against my brother
We're just here to love each other
In the right place at the right time
Lifting hearts and hands in one accord
In the right place and the right time
Anticipating good things from You, Lord
What a joy to be here
In Your presence one more time
Pressing forward
Leaving all our troubles far behind
We're in the right place
At the right time
Anticipating good things from You, Lord
(Repeat Chorus)
Thinking on the things
That make us strong and help us grow
We can dare to risk and reach
And stumble when we know
We're in the right place
At the right time
Anticipating good things from You, Lord
Anticipating good things from You, Lord
From You, Lord (from You, Lord)
From You, Lord (from You, Lord)
From You, Lord (from You, Lord)
