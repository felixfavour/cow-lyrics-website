Marvellous grace of our loving Lord Grace that exceeds, our sin and our guilt
Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured,
There where the blood of Lamb was  spilled
Grace grace, God's grace
Grace that will  pardon and cleanse within
Grace grace, God's grace
Grace that is greater than all our sin
Marvellous infinite matchless grace Freely bestowed, on all who believe You that are longing to see his face
Will you this moment his grace receive
Grace grace, God's grace
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
Grace grace, God's grace
Grace that is greater than all our sin
Grace grace, God's grace
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
Grace grace, God's grace
Grace that is greater than all our sin
