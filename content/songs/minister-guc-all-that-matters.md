I will put you in Front
In front of my Melody
You're all that Matters
You're all that Matters
I'll make room for Two
You and I Jesus
You're all that Matters
You're all that Matters
Owei, Owei (Yes, Yes)
You're all that Matters
Owei, Owei (Yes, Yes)
You're all that Matters
Owei, Owei (Yes, Yes)
You're all that Matters
What would I live for
If I don't have you in my Life
What would I Gain
If you take the Holy Ghost
What would have become of me
If I didn't see your Light
What would have been said of me
If you didn't hold my Hands
Now I've come to realise
That you are all I have
You're all that matters
You're all that matters
I will put you in Front
In front of my Melody
You're all that Matters
You're all that Matters
I'll make room for Two
You and I Jesus
You're all that
