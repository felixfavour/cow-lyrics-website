O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel!
O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free
Thine own from Satan's tyranny;
From depths of hell Thy people save
And give them victory o'er the grave
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel! Yeah
O come, Desire of nations, bind
And won the hearts of all mankind
Bid Thou our sad divisions cease
And be thyself a King of peace
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel!
So rejoice! Rejoice! Emanuel
Has come to thee, O Israel!
Has come to thee, O Israel!
Israel
