Ah ah ah
...(Native language)
I'm amazed by all you do
I'm amazed you came through for me
Even in my darkness moments
Baba you lit up my world
I'm amazed by how you care
I'm amazed you're so full of love
You've been good from distant past
And yet you're still doing good
Obinigwe
Obinigwe
Obinigwe
Two-four, seven day every day you come
You come through for me
I had no essence, had no meaning Lord
You showed up for me
What did I do to deserve this kind of love
What did I do to sit at your right hand?
What did I do to deserve this kind of love
Ooh oh oh oh oh
... (In tongues)
Ooh Oh oh oh oh oh Ooh
... (In tongues)
Ooh oh oh oh oh Ooh
Ooh Oh oh oh oh oh Ooh
I'm amazed, I'm amazed
I'm amazed you came through for me
I'm amazed, I'm amazed
I'm amazed you showed up for me
Obinigwe (Uuh uh uh uh Uuh)
... (In tongues)
(Uuh uh uh uh Uuh)
(Uuh uh uh uh Uuh)
I had no essence, I had no meaning
Lord, You came through for me
I had no standard, I had no helper
Lord, you showed up for me
What did I do to deserve this kind of love
What did I do to sit at your right hand
What did I do to deserve this kind of love oh
(And God said in that, when we were yet sinners He came)
(When we had no anointing)
(When we had no faith)
(When we had no Christ, when we had no pride He came)
(Nothing to make us proud He came, no car, nothing nothing He came)
(Have you asked yourself that question)
(What did you do to deserve this kind of love)
(Wherever lift-up your hands and begin to bless Him)
(It's good to dance it's good to jump around)
(But sometimes it's good to reflect)
(In one minute just begin to think about all the things God has done)
I'm amazed, I'm amazed
I'm amazed you came through for me
Obinigwe (Uuh uh uh uh Uuh)
Obinigwe (Uuh uh uh uh Uuh)
...(In tongues)
(Uuh uh uh uh Uuh)
(Uuh uh uh uh Uuh)
So worthy is the lamb
That sits upon the throne
So worthy is the lamb
That sits upon the throne
What did I do to deserve this kind of love
What did I do to sit at your right hand
I had no essence, had no meaning
Lord, you showed up for me
I had no helper, I had no platform
Lord, you showed up for me
I call you Obinigwe
(Uuh uh uh uh Uuh)
(Uuh uh uh uh Uuh)
...(In tongues)
(Uuh uh uh uh Uuh)
(Uuh uh uh uh Uuh)
I had no meaning, had no essence
Lord, you showed up for me
You had nothing, you had no meaning
And yet, he showed up for you
What did you do to deserve this kind of love
What did you do to sit at his right hand?
Worthy is the lamb
That sits up-on the throne
(He is called the lifter of men)
(He picks one that is down and sets him for the world to see)
(That is the God we came to serve)
(If it is that same God I came to serve can you lift up you hands)
(And open up your mouth and begin to bless in other tongues)
(At least I can hear people)
...(In tongues) (In tongues) (In tongues)
Oh oh oh ooh oh oh oh ooh
...(In tongues) (In tongues) (In tongues)
I had no essence, had no meaning
Lord, you showed up for me
I had no oil, had no anointing
Lord
What did you do to deserve this kind of love
(It's not by work that any man should boast)
