This is the gospel of Jesus Christ
This is the gospel of Jesus Christ, yes
And I believe every word of the gospel of Jesus Christ
This is the gospel of Jesus Christ
This is the gospel of Jesus Christ, yes
And I believe every word of the gospel of Jesus Christ
People gathered around to see the Savior crucified
Seems like nobody really cared that He died at all
(No one, seemed liked no one cared)
They didn't know that it all fit in His plan
He said if He died, He would rise again on the third day
(Rise up, said He'd rise)
He came
He came from heaven above
He lived
He lived a life full of love
He died
He died to take away sin
And He rose
He rose and He'll come back again
