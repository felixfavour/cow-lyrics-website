 Dunsin Oyekan  Fragrance To Fire
First it was Fragrance
Then it Turned to Fire
My Worship is my Weapon
That is how you Win a Battle

{The Fragrance of my Worship
Rose up to the Father
Noises, Thundering's, Earthquakes
Were the Response to my Worship
The Fragrance of my Worship
Rose up to the Father
Noises, Thundering's, Lightnings
Were the Response to my Worship}[x2]

First it was Fragrance
Then it Turned to Fire
My Worship is my Weapon
This is how I Win my Battle
First it was Fragrance
Then it Turned to Fire
My Worship is my Weapon
This is how I Win my Battle

{The Fragrance of my Worship
Rose up to the Father
Noises, Thundering's, Earthquakes
Were the Response to my Worship

Rose up to the Father
Noises, Thundering's, Lightnings
Were the Response to my Worship}[x2]
