Miracles are about to break off in your life
I need you to tap three people
And tell them for the next seven years
I'm experiencing nothing but endless miracles, breakthroughs, signs, and wonders
But guess what's going to happen
A bunch of haters are going to start coming to you
Trying to make you discount what God has done in your life
So I heard the Spirit of the Lord say let this be your testimony
Jesus did it
Jesus did it
Healed my body
Changed my life
Yes he did
I need somebody to go crazy in the room
I need somebody to go crazy in the room
Some of y'all go back to the doctor and
They're not going to be able to find what it is they found before
You outta walk right up in the room with a doctor's report and shout
Jesus did it
Jesus did it
Jesus did it
Jesus did it
Yes he did
