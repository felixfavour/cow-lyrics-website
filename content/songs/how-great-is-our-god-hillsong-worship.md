The splendor of a King, clothed in majesty
Let all the Earth rejoice
All the Earth rejoice
He wraps himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
Age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end
The Godhead Three in One
Father Spirit Son
The Lion and thе Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb
How great is our God, sing with mе
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
Name above all names (how great is our God, sing with me)
Worthy of our praise (how great is our God, and all will see)
My heart will sing
How great is our God
You're the name above all names (how great is our God, sing with me)
You are worthy of our praise (how great is our God, and all will see)
And my heart will sing
How great is our God
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God, and all will see
How great, how great is our God
