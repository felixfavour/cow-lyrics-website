This holy desire
Is burning and it just gets brighter
Can't put out this fire
I've just gotta lift You higher
[Pre-Chorus]
If there's ever been a time, the time is now, right now
If there's ever been a name to sing out loud, out loud
Jesus, You deserve it
You are worth it
All of my passion
All of my passion
Jesus, I can't contain it
My love, my praises
All of my passion
All of my passion
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Not manmade emotions
Oh, this is from a deep devotion
Not fleeting like feelings
I'll sing as long as I am breathing
