Behold, the King has come
Divinity incarnate
Creator of the world
Breathing our air
Behold what light has come
And the dark cannot contain it
The Savior of the world
Is finally here
[Chorus: Phil Wickham]
Oh, come, let us adore Him
Come, let us adore Him
For He alone is worthy
Christ the Lord
Behold, the Father's love
Beyond all comprehension
He gave His only Son
To die in our place
Go and see that empty tomb
He’s not there, for He is risen
Every heart prеpare Him room
Jesus Christ, the King of Hеaven
