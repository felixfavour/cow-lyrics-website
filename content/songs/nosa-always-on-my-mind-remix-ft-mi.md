I tell you say na you I dey think of when you call
If I tell you say I no forget you at all at all
You no go believe wetin I dey talk
If I tell you say na you I dey think of when you call
If I tell you say I no forget you at all at all
You no go believe wetin I dey talk
Cause everyday, if I remember you, smile dey come my face
Day by day, January to December, you dey for my prayers
So make you believe me, wetin I dey talk
Cause you're always on my mind
Always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Yes you are
You're always on my mind
If I tell you say I dey with you through your ups and downs
If I tell you say I dey with you even if I'm not around
Shey you go believe wetin I dey talk?
Cause in this our case
Out of sight no be out of mind
And by God's grace one day
we go dey together just like old times
Shey you dey feel everything I talk
And you're always on my mind
No forget you're always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Yes you are always on my mind.I no forget you at all at all
always on my mind.yes you are
make i no preach cause i no be pastor but
when me and God talked one thing that i asked for is
that his grace would never pass you by
you'd be strong during trouble they gon ask you why
cause you got somebody praying for you as you cry
see time is like bugatti mehn how fast to fly
and anytime soon we go jam
i know that you been praying for me to thats why we fam
meanwhile fly as high as you can
if the sun burns * like cigarettes
we will only go higher God will deliver us
no wilderness no bitterness no sickness
we dont see each other everyday but i find
maybe thats why people say that love is blind
see yesterday is gone and we cant rewind
it dont even matter though cause you aways on my mind
on my mind
always on my mind
always on my mind
you no comot your always on my mind
always on my mind
believe me when i say
i love you soo
always on my mind
always in my mind
you are always on my mind
