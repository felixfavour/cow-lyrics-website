In my mother's womb
You formed me with Your hands
Known and loved by You
Before I took a breath
When I doubt it, Lord, remind me
I'm wonderfully made
You're an artist and a potter
I'm the canvas and the clay
You make all things work together
For my future and for my good
You make all things work together
For Your glory and for Your name
There's a healing light
Just beyond the clouds
Though I've walked through fire
I see clearly now
I know nothing has been wasted
No failure or mistake
You're an artist and a potter
I'm the canvas and the clay
You make all things work together
For my future and for my good
You make all things work together
For Your glory and for Your name
You're not finish with me...
When I doubt it, Lord, remind me
I'm wonderfully made
You're an artist and a potter
I'm the canvas and the clay
And I know nothing has been wasted
No failure or mistake
You're an artist and a potter
I'm the canvas and the clay
