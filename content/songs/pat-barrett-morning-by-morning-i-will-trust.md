Daily, daily I surrender
Grace for today is all that I need
Surprised by a mercy that's new every morning
Awaken my soul to sing
Oh, awaken my soul to sing
I will trust where You lead
I will trust when I can't see
Morning by morning
Great is Your faithfulness to me
Breath by breath overtaken by wonder
One step at a time when I'm overwhelmed
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow
Awaken my soul to sing
Awaken my soul to sing
I will trust where You lead
I will trust when I can't see
Morning by morning
Great is Your faithfulness to me
I will trust with all my heart
You are good, You always are
Morning by morning
Great is Your faithfulness to me
All fear be reminded
My future is secure
My Father has spoken
And He keeps His every word
All fear be reminded
My future is secure
My Father has spoken
And He keeps His every word
So I will trust
I will trust You
Morning by morning
Morning by morning
I will trust where You lead
I will trust when I can't see
Morning by morning
Great is Your faithfulness to me
I will trust with all my heart
You are good, You always are
Morning by morning
Great is Your faithfulness to me
