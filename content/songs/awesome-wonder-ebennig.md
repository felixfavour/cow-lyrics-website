Oh lord my God
When am in awesome wonder
Consider all the works
Thy hands has made
I see the star
I hear the rolling thunder
The power throughout the universe display
When through the woods and forest glade i wonder
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
When i look down from lofty mountain grandure
And hear the brook and feel that gentle breeze
Then sing my soul
My saviour lord to thee
How great thou art
How great thou art
Then sings my soul my saviour lord to thee
How great though art
How great thoug art
When christ shall come
With shout of acclamation
And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart
Then i shall bow
In humble adoration
And then proclaim
My God how great though art
Then sings my soul
My saviour lord to thee
How great thou art
How great thou art
Then sing ma soul
My saviour lord to thee
How great thou art
How great thou art
