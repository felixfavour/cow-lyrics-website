More Of You
(chorus)
More of You, and less of me;
Lord, I pray that there might be
More of You and less of me
More of You, and less of me;
Lord, I pray that there might be
More of You and less of me
Like a grain of wheat that falls to the earth
And dies to live anew;
All my plans and earthly desires
I lay them down to follow You
