Verse]
We know you are Rewarder
Of those who diligently
Seek your Face
All Power is in your Hands
With you, nothing is impossible to do [x4]
This is the Confidence
That when we come to you

What you cannot Fix
What you cannot Do
What you cannot Solve
Does not Exist [x2]

We know you are Rewarder
Of those who Diligently
Seek your Face
All Power is in your Hands
With you, nothing is impossible to do [x2]
{This is the Confidence
That when we come to you

What you cannot Fix
What you cannot Do
What you cannot Solve [x4]
