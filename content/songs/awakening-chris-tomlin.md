In our hearts, lord, in this nation
Awakening
Holy spirit, we desire
Awakening
For you and you alone
Awake my soul, awake my soul and sing
For the world you love
Your will be done, let your will be done in me
In your presence, in your power
Awakening
For this moment, for this hour
Awakening
For you and you alone
Awake my soul, awake my soul and sing
For the world you love
Your will be done, let your will be done in me [x2]
[Bridge]
Like the rising sun that shines
From the darkness comes a light
I hear your voice and this is my
Awakening [x2]
