I'm living proof
Of what the mercy of God can do
If you knew me then, you'd believe me now
He turned my whole life upside down
Took the old and He made it new
That's just what the mercy of God can do

Now I'm alive to tell the story
How I've overcome
By His goodness and mercy
And the power of the blood
And I'm so glad that my freedom
Wasn't based on what I've done
But His goodness and mercy
And the power of the blood
I thought I deserved
To be six feet beneath the earth
For all the things I've done and the things I've said
The choices made that I regret
Oh, I would still be lost
Oh, but for the mercy of God

Now I'm alive to tell the story
How I've overcome
His goodness and mercy
And the power of the blood
And I'm so glad that my freedom
Wasn't based on what I've done
But His goodness and mercy
And the power of the blood

There's power in His blood
I know 'cause it healed me
Yeah, I know 'cause it changed me
There's wonder-working power in the blood

And was the Cross meant for me
That my Savior carried?
Oh, I've been made free
By the mercy of God
Was the grave meant for me
Where my sin lay buried?
Now I stand redeemed
By the mercy of God
Was the Cross meant for me
That my Savior carried?
Now I've been made free
By the mercy of God
And was the grave meant for me
Where my sin lay buried?
Now I stand redeemed
By the mercy of God

And I'm alive to tell the story
How I've overcome
It's His goodness and mercy
And the power of the blood
And I'm so glad that my freedom
Wasn't based on what I've done
But His goodness and mercy
And the power of the blood
His goodness and mercy
And the power of the blood
It's His goodness and mercy
And the power of the blood

Mm, wonder-working power
It's life-changing power
It's heart-healing power
In His blood
Oh, in His blood

At the Cross, at the Cross
Where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rode away
It was there by faith
I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day
At the Cross, at the Cross
Where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rode away
It was there by faith
I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day

Was the Cross meant for me
That my Savior carried?
Oh, I've been made free
By the mercy of God
Was the grave meant for me
Where my sin lay buried?
Now I stand redeemed
By the mercy of God
By the mercy of God
