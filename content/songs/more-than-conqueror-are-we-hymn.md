1. Conquerors victorier now are we
Through the precious blood of Jesus
we've victory
lf the Lord for us, we can never fail
Nothing against His mighty can
n'erprevail

chorus
Conquerors are we, through the
blood of Jesus
God will give us
victory, through the blood of Jesus.
Thro the Lamb for sinners slain
Yet who lives and reigns again
More than conquerors are we
more than conquerors are we

2. In the name of Israel's God well
onward press
Overcoming sin all
unrighteousness
Not to us, but unto Him the praise
shall be
For salvation and for blood brought
victory

chorus
Conquerors are we, through the
blood of Jesus
God will give us
victory, through the blood of Jesus.
Through the Lamb for sinners slain
Yet who lives and reigns again
More than conquerors are we
more than conquerors are we

3. Unto him that overcometh shall be
pow'r
Here to eat of hidden manna sent
from heaven
Over yonder he the victors palm
shall bear
And a robe of white and golden
Crown shall wear

chorus
Conquerors are we, through the
blood of Jesus
God will give us
victory, through the blood of Jesus.
Thro the Lamb forsinners slain
Yetwholives and reigns again
More than conquerors are we
more than conquerors are we
