[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
This is for that little child with no father
For that man that doesn't have a place to stay
For that little boy living with AIDS
[R. Kelly] Can I tell you a story, tell you a story
[Kirk] You can lean on me
There's a man
Standing on the corner
He has no home
He has no food
And his blue skies are gone
Can't you hear him cryin' out
And there's a girl
Searching for a father and a friend
Praying that the storm someday will end
But instead of walking away
Open up your heart and say
[Hook: Choir]
I, am here
You don't have to worry
I can see, your tears
I'll be there in a hurry when you call
[Choir] Friends are there to catch you when you fall
[Choir] Here's my shoulder, you can lean on me
