Grace, glorious grace
Grace, glorious grace
At the cross, You called it finished
Grace, wonderful grace
Grace, wonderful grace
At the cross all of my sin is
Covered, covered, covered by Your grace, oh
Covered, covered, covered by Your grace, oh
Grace, beautiful grace
Grace, beautiful grace
At the cross, love everlasting
Grace, powerful grace
Oh, grace, powerful grace
At the cross all of my past is
Covered, covered, covered by Your grace, oh
Covered, covered, covered by Your grace
[Bridge]
No matter what I’ve done, no matter where I’ve been
No matter how I fall, You pick me up again
You have removed my shame, You take me as I am
You call me justified, now I am covered by Your grace
