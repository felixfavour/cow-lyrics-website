I am serving a Living God
His name is Jesus Christ
He died and He rose
And gave me victory
I have victory
(Sing along with me) I am serving a Living God
His name is Jesus Christ
He died and He rose
And gave me victory
I have victory
There was a time in my life
Around nineteen seventy six
I had been sick for six years
And the doctor told my parent
Your son has got two more weeks to live
Then I said Jesus You died (Yes You died)
And You rose (Yes You rose)
And You took all my sickness and pain
I've got to have victory
I am serving a Living God
His name is Jesus Christ
He died and He rose
And gave me victory
I have victory
There was a time in my life
In around nineteen eighty two
I'm with Kathryn she's a darling
But no more food in the house to eat
Then I said Jesus You died (Yes You died)
And You rose (Yes You rose)
And You gave me abundant life
I've got to have victory
I am serving a Living God
His name is Jesus Christ
He died and He rose
And gave me victory
I have victory
I am serving a Living God
His name is Jesus Christ
He died and He rose
And gave me victory
I have victory
Hallelujah thank You Jesus
I exalt Your Holy Name
Thank you Father
Jesus You died (Yes You died)
And You rose (Yes You rose)
For You died (Yes You died)
And You rose (Yes You rose)
For You died (Yes You died)
And You rose (Yes You rose)
My Jesus died (Yes You died)
And You rose (Yes You rose)
Jesus You died (Yes You died)
And then You rose (Yes You rose)
For You died (Yes You died)
And then You rose (Yes You rose)
For You died (Yes You died)
And then You rose (Yes You rose)
My Jesus died (Yes You died)
And You rose (Yes You rose)
Jesus You died (Yes You died)
And then You rose (Yes You rose)
And gave me victory
I have victory
