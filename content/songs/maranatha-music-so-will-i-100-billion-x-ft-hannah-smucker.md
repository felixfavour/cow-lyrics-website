God of creation
there at the start before the begbeginning of time
with no point of reference
you spoke tto the dark and flashed out the wonder of light
and as you speak a hundrend billiln galaxies are born
in the vapour of your breath the planets form
if the stars wewere meant to worship so will i
 i can see your heart in everything yoyouve made
 every burning star a signifier of grace if creatio n sings your praise so will i
so. will i
God of your promise you dont speak iin vain no sylabal empty or void
for once you have spoken all nature and science follow the sound of your voice
and you speak a hundred billoon creatures catch your breath evolving in pursuit of what you say
if it all reveals your nature so will i
i can see your heart in everything you say
every painted sky icanvas of your grace
if creation still obeys you so wwill i
so will i*2
if the stars were meant to worship so will i
if the mountains bow in reverence so will i
if the oceans roar your greatness so will i
for if everything exists to lift you high so will i
if the wind goes were you send it so will i
if the rocks cry out in silence so will i
if the sum of all our praise still falls shy
i will sing again in a hundred billion times
oiooo
God of all salvation you chaswd down my heart through all of my failures and pride
on a hill you created the light of the world abandonded in darkness to die
and as you speak a hundred billion failures disappear
where you lost you life so i ciuld find it here
if you left the grave behind you tgen ao will i
 i can see your heart in everything you've done
ever
if you gladly chose surrender so will i
i can see your heart in a billion different ways
every precious one a child you died to save
if you gave your life to love them so will i
like you would again a hundred billion times
well what measure could amount to what your desire you are the one who never leaves the one behind
