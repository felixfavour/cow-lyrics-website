[Instrumental]
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly trust in Jesus name
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly trust in Jesus name
[Chorus: Reuben Morgan]
Christ alone, Cornerstone
The weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm, He is Lord
Lord of all
When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil
My anchor holds within the veil
[Chorus: Reuben Morgan]
Christ alone, Cornerstone
The weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm, He is Lord
Lord of all
He is Lord, Lord of all
Christ alone, Cornerstone
The weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm, He is Lord
Lord of all
