I'm caught up in Your presence
I just want to sit here at Your feet,
I'm caught up in this holy moment,
I never want to leave
Oh, I'm not here for blessings
Jesus, You don't owe me anything
More than anything that You can do
I just want You
I'm sorry when I've just gone through the motions
I'm sorry when I just sang another song
Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to You
I'm sorry when I've come with my agenda
I'm sorry when I forgot that You're enough
Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to You
I'm caught up in Your presence
I just want to sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave
Oh, I'm not here for blessings
Jesus, You don't owe me anything
And more than anything that You can do
I just want You
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else, Jesus
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want You
Nothing else, nothing else, Jesus
Nothing else will do
I'm coming back to where we started
I'm coming back to where we started
When I first felt Your love
You're all that matters, Jesus
You're all that matters
I'm coming back to what really matters
Just Your heart
I just want to bless Your heart, Jesus
I'm caught up in Your presence
I just want to sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave
And oh, I'm not here for blessings
Jesus, You don't owe me anything
More than anything that You can do
Oh, I just want You
