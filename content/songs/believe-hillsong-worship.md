You are my light
You are my strength
You are my Rock
On You I stand
I lift my voice
I raise my hands
I lift my soul
With all I am
In Christ forever I'll stand
I will believe
You are strong enough
In my weakness
God be lifted up
And I will sing
Lift Your praises high
Lord be magnified
You make all things new
I will believe
So, hear this song
Receive our praise
You are our strength
For all our days
