I was going down, thought it was for the count
But then I found Your love
I had wandered off, thought I had gone too far
There I found Your love
The fear I used to know, can't stop me anymore
'Cause I found Your love
When I feel alone, I have a place to go
'Cause I found Your love!
[Pre-Chorus]
Great, was the debt of sin
Grace, bought me back again
Now, I am rising up
Won, by the Saviour's love
Your love, is higher than the stars
Declaring who You are
Your love, uncontainable
Your love, is deep enough to reach
The deepest part of me
Your love, uncontainable
Your love...
