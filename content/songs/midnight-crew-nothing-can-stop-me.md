like a rising sun, above the sky
Just like a shining star day after day
I have a future I cannot fail,
No no nothing cant stop me
Am like a rising sun, above the sky
Just like a shining star day after day
I have a future I cannot fail,
Nothing cant stop me
(Prophecy)
Nothing can stop me
So I prophecy in the name of Jesus
That nothing is gonna stop you
Congratulation welcome to the promised  land
Welcome to you place of peace
Let peace reign, you have dominion
Enjoy it and fufill your destiny
I cannot fail, halleluyah
Nothing can stop me
Nothing, nothing can, nothing can stop you
