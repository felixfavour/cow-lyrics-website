[Intro]
Hmmm
Hmmm
Everybody wants to be seen
Everybody wants a higher place
But is anybody really happy?
Could it be that there's a better way?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
If You hide me in Your shadow
What I thought I wanted now fades away
You unravel me 'till You become
The only one I love
What's hidden here is holy, holy
What's hidden here is holy, holy
What's hidden here is
I will leave the crowd behind me
You'll be the only beauty I behold
I come alive in our communion
Just to bะต with You is my reward
