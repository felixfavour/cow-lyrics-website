If you see the moon
Rising gently on your fields
If the wind blows softly on your face
If the sunset lingers
While cathedral bells peal
And the moon has risen to her place
You can thank the Father
For the things that He has done
And thank Him for the things He's yet to do
And if you find a love that's tender
If you find someone who's true
Then thank the Lord
He's been doubly good to you
And if you look in the mirror
At the end of a hard day
And you know in your heart you have not lied
And if you gave love freely
If you earned an honest wage
And if you've got Jesus by your side
You can thank the Father
For the things that He has done
And thank Him for the things He's yet to do
And if you find a love that's tender
If you find someone who's true
Thank the Lord
He's been doubly good to you
You can thank the Father
For the things that He has done
And thank Him for the things He's yet to do
And if you find a love that's tender
If you find someone who's true
Thank the Lord
He's been doubly good to you
