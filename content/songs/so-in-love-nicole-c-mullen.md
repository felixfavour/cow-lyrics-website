Have you ever noticed
When i begin to focus
I reslly wanna show this
In all that i do
It's written in the stars
And shining in the heavens
No weak infatuation
For me will do
Well I'm so in love with you
I'm so in love with you
I'm so in love with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm telling you
I'm so in love with you
I'm so in love with you
I'm so in love with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm telling you
Have you ever noticed
When i begin to focus
I reslly wanna show this
In all that i do
It's written in the stars
And shining in the heavens
No weak infatuation
For me will do
