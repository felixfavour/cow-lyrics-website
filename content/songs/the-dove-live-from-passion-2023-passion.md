1 God was there at the beginning
His Spirit brooding like a Dove
Spoke the earth into existence
Formed creation that He loved
Man was born of perfect image
Made to be a friend of God
Meant to dwell within His presence
Yeah, it’s where we all belong
Chorus:
Holy Spirit
All we need is more of You
We want more of You
Holy Spirit
All we need is more of You
We want more of You
2 When sin had spoiled creation
The creator sent a flood
On the cusp of new beginning
He again released the Dove
And after all the searching
It found a place to land
On Christ the perfect Son
Who would redeem it all again
Looking for the branches
It landed on the vine
The one for our redemption
Who would bridge eternal life
