In Your Name
There is hope when all seems lost
There is freedom in the power of the cross
Let the world see
In Your Name
There is truth where logic fails
Understanding that makes sense of our days
You Are Worthy
(Pre-Chorus)
Hear the song of all creation roar
We're crying out as One
To You our God
Now show us the way of Your love
And we will come running
(Chorus)
All for Jesus' name
Your love displayed
We are alive in the mystery
All for sinners' gain
Your life You gave
We'll sing Your praise for eternity
