[Chorus:]
They'll call it a mystery
But we're gonna call it victory
We'll be writing history
It's gon' be victory
They'll be signs on top of signs
Just so you know the history
It's saying victory is with me
Oh let them laugh about it
Don't worry what the doubter's saying
Yes it's an uphill battle
But guess who else is playing
The next time ya'll in action
And the Ghost is in the room
Watch you work through the masses
You know that we've been used
[Pre-Chorus:]
Let go, let it be
No matter how deep
I swear just beneath
You'll find victory (find your victory)
[Chorus]
