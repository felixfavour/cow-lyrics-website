Just one king and just one crown
'Could rule and reign
Here till the darkness has bowed down
So hear Your people as we pray
And humbly seek Your face
We seek Your face
Whatever You want
Whatever You ask
Our lives are Yours
We gladly lay them in Your hands
Set revival free in our surrendering
Come start a fire and let it burn
We're crying out till heaven fills the earth
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Just one love and just one hope
Could unify this great divide and make us whole
A royal priesthood for Your fame
A people called by Your great name
By Your great name
