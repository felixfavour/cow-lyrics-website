Someone's knocking at the door
Someone’s knocking at the door
Can you hear Him knocking?
Can you hear Him knocking?
He's been knocking very long
He's been knocking for so long
Can you hear Him knocking?
Can you hear Him knocking?
Jesus Jesus Jesus, is at the door
Jesus Jesus Jesus, is at the door
Someone’s calling out your name
Calling time and time again
Can you hear Him calling?
Can you hear Him calling?
He's been calling very long
He's been calling for so long
Can you hear Him calling?
He's been calling you
It's Jesus Jesus Jesus, is at the door
Jesus Jesus Jesus, is at the door
Don't let Him walk away (Don't let Him walk away)
He's so patient but, don’t take a chance
All You need to do is open the door
Let Him take His rightful place
So He can change your world
Open up the door...
Open up the door...
Open up the door...
Open up the door (Open up the door)
Open up the door (Open up the door now)
Open up the door...
Jesus Christ is waiting (Open up the door)
The lamb of God is calling you (Open up the door)
The Lamb of God is knocking (Open up the door)
You’re keeping Him waiting (Open up the door)
He just wants to love you (Open up the door)
He just wants to bless you (Open up the door)
Why don't you open up the door now? (Open Up the door)
Open up the door now (Open up the door)
Open up the door now (Open up the door)
Open up the door...(Open up the door)
Open up...
Open Up the door (Na na na na na na na)...
