Give me your idols, every God that you made
You know the things you love more than me
You'd die if I took them away
Give me your options, let me be the first one to call
Now you must choose what I am to you
God of all or not God at all
A God of all or not God at all
Give me the mountain you're not strong enough to climb
I'll restore the days that you threw away
I love to return wasted time
Give me the questions, there's not one too great or too small
Still, you can't be free 'til you let me be
God of all or not God at all
And God of all or not God at all
Tell me who's the king of glory
And writes every one of our stories
Who knows the end before life begins
And took all our debts to the grave
So give me your weapons, be still while your enemies fall
But you'll never see 'til you let me be
God of all or not God at all
And God of all or not God at all
Oh, tell me who's the king of glory
And writes every one of our stories
Who knows the end before life begins
And took all our debts to the grave
So give me your weapons, be still while your enemies fall
But you'll never see 'til you let me be
God of all or not God at all
God of all or not God at all
A God of all or not God at all
(Hey) Tell me who's the king of glory (Tell me)
And writes every one of our stories
Who knows the end (Still) before life begins
And took all our debts to the grave (Listen)
So give me forever, we'll meet when the last trumpet calls
I gave you my life, so now you decide (Who will I be?)
A God of all or not God at all
