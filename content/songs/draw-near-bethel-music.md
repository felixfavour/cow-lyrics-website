And draw near to me
For I have drawn near to You
And pull on the strings of my heart
For I long to respond to You
All my love is for You
And all my love is Yours
And all my love is for You
And all my love is Yours
Draw near to me
For I have drawn near to You
And pull on the strings of my heart
For I long to respond to You
All my love is for You
And all my love is Yours
And all my love is for You
And all my love is Yours
[Bridge]
I have made a place for You here
So come on, come on
All things are possible here
So come on, come on
