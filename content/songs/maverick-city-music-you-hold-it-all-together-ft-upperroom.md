You come, at the right time,
When I least expect it,
Never behind
So why would I be Surprised,
When you deliver,
Every time
---------
On mountaintops
You stay the same
In valleys low, you never change
-----------
And I believe that I will see
The Goodness of the Lord
I'm Confident as Seasons change
Your Faithfulness Remains
-----------
You go, you go before me
To prepare the Blessing
You made a way
It's more than I could Imagine
More than I can Fathom
Or Comprehend
-----------
On mountaintops
You stay the same
In valleys low, you never change
---------------
And I believe that I will see
The Goodness of the Lord
I'm Confident as Seasons change
Your Faithfulness Remains
--------------
God of my Present, God of my Future
You write my Story
You Hold it all Together
God of my Present, God of my Future
You write my Story
You Hold it all Together
God of my Present, God of my Future
You write my Story
You Hold it all Together
God of my Present, God of my Future
You write my Story
You Hold it all Together
---------------
And I believe that I will see
The Goodness of the Lord
I'm Confident as Seasons change
Your Faithfulness Remains
------------
God of my Present, God of my Future
You write my Story
You Hold it all Together
God of my Present, God of my Future
You write my Story
You Hold it all Together
--------------
And I believe that I will see
The Goodness of the Lord
I'm Confident as Seasons change
Your Faithfulness Remains
