You guide me through the dark
You calm my fearful heart, I will rest in You
[Pre-Chorus]
You give me perfect peace
You fill my deepest need, I will rest in You
God, shining like the sun, let Your kingdom come
I want to be with You in Your presence
Your kindness draws me in
Now I'm with You once again, I will rest in You
[Pre-Chorus]
My God, who reigns on high
To You alone I cry, I will rest in You
God, shining like the sun, let Your kingdom come
I want to be with You in Your presence
I'm here to give You praise, You take my breath away
And now I'm here with You in Your presence
