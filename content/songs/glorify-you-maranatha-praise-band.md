We stand in awe of Your presence
And we seek Your holiness
For Your love it is eternal
Living waters flow from You
Father in Heaven
We've come to worship You
Holy Spirit
Teaching us to walk in You
Jesus sweet Savior
We want to glorify You
We stand in awe of Your presence
And we seek Your holiness
For Your love it is eternal
Living waters flow from You
Father in Heaven
We've come to worship You
Holy Spirit
Teaching us to walk in You
Jesus, sweet Savior
We want to glorify You
