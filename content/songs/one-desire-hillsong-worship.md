You gave it all for me
My soul desire, my everything
And all I am is devoted to You
How could I fail to see
You are the love that rescued me
And all I am is devoted to You
[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, how could I not be moved
Lord, here with You
So have Your way in me
'Cause Lord, there is just one thing that I will seek
This is my cry, my one desire
Is to be where You are, Lord, now and forever
It's more than a song, my one desire
Is to be with You, Is to be with You, Jesus
How could I fail to see
You are the love that rescued me
And all I am is devoted to You
