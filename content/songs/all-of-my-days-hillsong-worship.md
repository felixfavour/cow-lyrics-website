Proclaim Your awesome power
Tell of mighty deeds
Declare Your future kingdom
Of everlasting peace
[Pre-Chorus]
And my eyes, they look unto You always
And I am captured by your majesty
All of my days, I will sing of Your greatness
All of my days, I will speak of Your grace
All of my days, I will tell of Your wondrous love
Your love in my life, Your love
All Your works will praise You
Your children bless Your name
We speak of all Your goodness
We walk in fields of grace
[Pre-Chorus]
And my eyes, they look unto You always
And I am captured by your majesty
