"Prepare The Way"
We've heard the revival stories
Of ancient and old time glory
Spirit of God, come do it again
Miracle-working power
Moving in signs and wonders
Spirit of God, come do it again
Prepare the way, He's coming through
Ready or not, our God's on the move
We're gonna see, Heaven on Earth
Come Holy Spirit, awaken Your church
God, You're just getting started
A testimony of more to come
Spirit of God, come do it in us
We join in the faith of Heaven
And prophesy Your kingdom here on Earth
Spirit of God, come do it in us
Prepare the way, He's coming through
Ready or not, our God's on the move
We're gonna see, Heaven on Earth
Come Holy Spirit, awaken Your church
Prepare the way, He's coming through
Ready or not, our God's on the move
We're gonna see, Heaven on Earth
Come Holy Spirit, awaken Your church
Sing this out with me
Fire fall, wind come blow
We're ready for more, ready for more
Break down the walls, push back the doors
We're ready for more, ready for more
Fire fall, wind come blow
We're ready for more, ready for more
Break down the walls, push back the doors
We're ready for more, ready for more
Fire fall, wind come blow
We're ready for more, ready for more
Break down the walls, push back the doors
We're ready for more, ready for more, oh-oh-oh-oh
Fire fall, wind come blow
We're ready for more, ready for more
Break down the walls, push back the doors
We're ready for more, ready for more, yeah
Fire fall, wind come blow
We're ready for more, ready for more
Break down the walls, push back the doors
We're ready for more, ready for more, yeah
Fire fall, wind come blow
We're ready for more, ready for more
Break down the walls, push back the doors
We're ready for more
Prepare the way, He's coming through
Ready or not, our God's on the move
We're gonna see, Heaven on Earth
Come Holy Spirit, awaken Your church, yes
We've heard the revival stories
Of ancient and old time glory
Spirit of God, come do it again
