In the grieving and in the aching
The dawn is breaking on our third day
And in a moment comes the message
Shouted breathless, our King is raised
Have you heard the news, that veil is torn in two?
And what you could not reach you are now able to
Have you heard the news, death is hollow now?
'Cause the grave you feared has been emptied out
In our upper room appearing
He is here and we can see
How the scars on His hands and feet
Tell the great defeat of our enemy
Have you heard the news, that veil is torn in two?
And what you could not reach you are now able to
Have you heard the news, death is hollow now?
'Cause the grave you feared has been emptied out
[Bridge]
With His blood in the soil and thorns in His head
He ripped all the power and the fear out of death
With His arms stretched out on the breadth of the cross
In undefeatable life, He was covering us
With His blood in the soil and thorns in His head
He ripped all the power and the fear out of death
With His arms stretched out on the breadth of the cross
In undefeatable life, He was covering us
With His blood in the soil and thorns in His head
He ripped all the power and the fear out of death
With His arms stretched out on the breadth of the cross
In undefeatable life, He was covering us
