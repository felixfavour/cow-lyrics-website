If you want a new beginning put your hands up
If you want to see the light put your hands high
Don't let anybody tell you that this is over
When you can have a chance to start a new chapter
If you want a new beginning put your hands up
If you want to see the light put your hands high
Don't let anybody tell you that this is over
When you can have a chance to start a new chapter
Careful with the devil cos the devil can play
Bulging with pleasure that the devil brought pain
When you lose your soul you're never the same
You're in control but just a slave
What would you give in exchange for your soul
The pleasures of riches or silver and gold
Or Maybe relationships could build this cos I'm feeling so empty inside my soul
Hustling and trapping that come
Uo??
Tried to find love just like??
they know I was lost
Since I am came across the message of God that gave me second chance
It's in my soul its in my past
Saved me from sin just before I was gonna crash
It was never gonna last
Now I'm a soldier for the Lord in the army of God
Who can cleanse me from my sins
Show me I can start again, men that's grace
I'm a man of the faith
And I die to the world so my soul could be saved
Way back when I was fake all the time I would pray when I sought God for his hand but I never sought his face
They say point to the universe
They said that was vast
But I looked into the word of God and saw that that was scam
Oh Don't let go
It's a crazy world out there
So don't let me go
Savior Don't let go
I put my faith in you so don't let me go
I put my trust in you so don't let me go
I put my trust in you
You Never leave us or forsake us
You're the only hope that we need
The alpha and omega
The anchor of our soul
