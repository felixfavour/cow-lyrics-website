"Be Glorified"

With every beat of my heart
Every song that I sing
Every prayer that I pray
Every offering I bring
In every thought that I have
Every word that I say
Be glorified (yeah, yeah)
From the start of each day
'Til the end of the night
Let me bring praise
Let me bring light
Oh Lord, I offer my life
As a sacrifice
Be glorified (yeah, yeah)
This is my prayer
It's the cry of my heart
Lord, I want my life
To reflect who you are
Oh Lord, please stir up the fire
And burn everything
'Til all I desire is You
With every breath that I take
In everything that I do
Let me lift up your name
And bring honor to you
Let the words of my mouth
Only speak truth
Oh, be glorified (yeah, yeah)
This is my prayer
It's the cry of my heart
Lord, I want my life
To reflect who you are
Oh Lord, please stir up the fire
And burn everything
'Til all I desire is you (All I desire is in you)
[Piano:]
Yeah yeah, ye, hmm hmm hmm
Yeah eeh

Yeah, yeah yeah eeh
(This is my prayer)
This is my prayer
It's the cry of my heart
Lord, I want my life
To reflect who you are
Oh Lord, please stir up the fire
And burn everything
'Til all I desire is you
With every beat of my heart
Every song that I sing
Every prayer that I pray
Every offering I bring
In every thought that I have
Every word that I say
Be glorified (Oh yes)
Be glorified (Oh Lord)
Be glorified (Oh yes)
Be glorified
In everything I say
Everything I do
Oh God(Be glorified)
In every situation
Every conversation
Oh God(Be glorified)
Be glorified (Oh yes)
Be glorified (Oh yeah)
Be glorified
It's my prayer
Be glorified...(Oooh yeah)
