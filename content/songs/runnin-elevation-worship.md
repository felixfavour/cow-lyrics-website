I have tasted, I have seen
The realness of Your love for me
It's written on Your hands and feet
It's all the evidence I'll ever need
[Chorus: Brandon Lake]
Your love is better than life
I can't even wrap my mind around it
One day here in Your house
Better than a thousand elsewhere, Your love
Keeps on runnin', runnin'
Keeps on runnin' after me
Keeps on runnin', runnin'
Keeps on runnin' after me
There's no one that can take Your place
Therе's nothing that can separate
Oh, how high, how wide, how deep
Thе greatest love the world has ever seen
[Chorus: Brandon Lake]
Your love is better than life
I can't even wrap my mind around it
One day here in Your house
Better than a thousand elsewhere, Your love
Keeps on runnin', runnin'
Keeps on runnin' after me
Keeps on runnin', runnin'
Keeps on runnin' after me
Run, run, runnin'
Run, run, runnin'
Run, run, runnin' after me
Run, run, runnin'
Run, run, runnin'
Run, run, runnin' after me
