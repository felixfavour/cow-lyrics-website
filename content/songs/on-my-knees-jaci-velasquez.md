There are days when I feel
The best of me is ready to begin
Then there's days when I feel
I'm letting go and soaring on the wind
'Cause I've learned in laughter or in pain
How to survive
I get on my knees
I get on my knees
There I am before the love that changes me
See, I don't know how, but there's power
When I'm on my knees
I can be in a crowd or by myself
Almost anywhere
When I feel there's a need to talk with God
He is Emmanuel
When I close my eyes, no darkness there
There's only light
I get on my knees
I get on my knees
There I am before the love that changes me
See, I don't know how, but there's power
