Could've come like a mighty storm
With all the strength of a hurricane
You could've come like a forest fire
With the power of Heaven in Your flame
(But) You came like a winter snow
Quiet and soft and slow
Falling from the sky in the night
To the earth below
Oh You could've swept in like a tidal wave
Or an ocean to ravish our hearts
You could have come through like a roaring flood
To wipe away the things that we've scarred
(But) You came like a winter snow
Quiet and soft and slow
Falling from the sky in the night
To the earth below
[Bridge]
Ooh no, Your voice wasn't in a bush burning
No, Your voice wasn't in a rushing wind
It was still, it was small, it was hidden
