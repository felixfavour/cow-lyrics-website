The spirit of heaven descends
Emi orun sokale

Kowa thought
Kowa gbewa ro

A heavenly dove came down and picked us up
Adaba orun sokale kowa gbe wa wo

Think of your blessed day in your head
Ro ojo ibukun re lewa ni ori

Leyin ipade wa yi jeka ri o ka tolo
The spirit of heaven descends
Emi orun sokale

The capital of heaven came down and came with us
Olu orun sokale kowa ba wa se

It is wrong that God is witness
Lese ti Olorun eri

Look at us God's mercy
Siju aanu re wo wa Olorun

Our happy father is listening to us
Baba ayo wa wa gbohun wa eh
Your Spirit, Your Spirit, Your Holy Spirit
