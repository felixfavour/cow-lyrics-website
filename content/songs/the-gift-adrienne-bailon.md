I only got one thing on my list
You are the only thing I want for Christmas
Baby, no worries, I got this
Wait till the morning, I'll make all your wishes come true
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's not about the presents, it's not about these jewels
It's all about your presence, just wanna get next to you
More than a holiday, I want it every day
As long as I live, I know the gift is you
The gift is you
The gift is you
I only got one thing on my mind
A love like ours made to last for a lifetime
I guess I must've done something right
'Cause I got everything I wanted
Baby, you're the reason why
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's not the trips to Paris, Fifth Avenue shopping sprees
It's all about your presence, just want you here next to me
More than a holiday, I want it every day
As long as I live, I know the gift is you
