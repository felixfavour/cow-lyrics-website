Open up
Let it flow now
Open up!
Out of the mundane
To where I'm ordained
For things that were made
Were made from things unseen
There are realms of glory
For my world to see
Dimensions found only
In Jesus Christ the Son
Channels of my spirit
Open up!
I am with the Father
Open up!
No boundaries, no limits
Open up!
Let deep call unto deep
Open up!
Channels of my spirit
Open up!
I am with the Father
Open up!
No boundaries, no limits
Open up!
Let deep call unto deep
Open up! Open up!
Let the river flow now
Out of the mundane
To where I'm ordained
For things that were made
Were made from things unseen
There are realms of glory
That my world should see
Dimensions found only
In Jesus Christ the Son
Channels of my spirit
(Open up!)
I am with the Father
(Open up!)
No boundaries, no limits
(Open up!)
Let deep call unto deep
(Open up!)
Channels of my spirit
(Open up!)
I am with the Father
(Open up!)
No boundaries, no limits
(Open up!)
Let deep call unto deep
(Open up!)
Channels of my spirit
(Open up!)
Because I am with the Father
(Open up!)
No boundaries, no limits
(Open up!)
Let deep call unto deep
(Open up!)
Channels of my spirit
(Open up!)
Because I am with the Father
(Open up!)
No boundaries, no limits
(Open up!)
Let deep call unto deep
(Open up!)
Out of my belly shall flow
Rivers of living water
Out of my belly shall flow
Out of my belly shall flow
Rivers of living water
Let deep call unto deep
Let it flow flow flow
No boundaries, no limits
Channels of my spirit
(Open up!)
I am with the Father
(Open up!)
No boundaries, no limits
(Open up!)
Let deep call unto deep
(Open up!)
Channels of my spirit
(Open up!)
I am with the Father
(Open up!)
No boundaries, no limits
(Open up!)
Let deep call unto deep
(Open up!)
Let it flow flow flow
Let it flow flow flow
Let the river flow

Rivers of living-

My oneness to see Jesus
The need to feel Jesus
Because I'm the extension of his hands
I'm the extension of his hands
I'm the carrier of Grace
I'm the carrier of Grace
Nations are inside of me
Open up! Open up!
Destinies are inside of me
Open up! Open up!
Out of the mundane
To where I'm ordained
For things that were made
Were made from things unseen
There are realms of glory
For my world to see
Dimensions found only
In Jesus Christ the Son
Channels of my spirit
I am with the Father
(Open up!)
No boundaries, no limits
(Open up!)
Let deep call unto deep
(Open up!)
Let it open now
