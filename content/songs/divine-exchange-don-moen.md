O see the man of sorrow
See the Son of God
Stripped of Heaven's glory
In the name of relentlesslove
Pure and undeserved
Sure as Calvary
Weighed upon His shoulders
All our grief
Our iniquity
Alleluia Alleluia
Praise be to God
Alleluia
O hear the scoffer mocking
See the Savior's tears
Wounded and forsaken
Son of Man
Oh behold Himhere
In the stead of failing
Burdened by despair
It was more than nails
Love alone
Is what kept Him there
