You say to us, "Seek Your face"Our hearts reply, "Your face we seek"And come teach us Lord, reveal Your ways
Anoint us for the greater things
[Chorus: Jeremy Riddle & Steffany Gretzinger]
We have gathered with one thirst and hunger
We are here to drink of glory and wonder
Here to cry out, "Come and fill this place!"Come and fill this place
And our single wish, our sole desire
To gaze upon Your beauty God
And we will not rest nor will we cease
Till with our eyes, Your face we see, yeah
[Chorus: Jeremy Riddle & Steffany Gretzinger]
We have gathered with one thirst and hunger
We are here to drink of glory and wonder
Here to cry out, "Come and fill this place!"[Post-Chorus: Jeremy Riddle & Steffany Gretzinger]
This place, come and fill this place
This place, come and fill this place
Oh, this place, come and fill this place
Oh, this place
