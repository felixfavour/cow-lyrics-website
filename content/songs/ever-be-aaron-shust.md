Your love is devoted
Like a ring of solid gold
Like a vow that is tested
Like a covenant of old
Your love is enduring
Through the winter rain
And beyond the horizon
With mercy for today
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Faithful You have been
And faithful You will be
You pledge yourself to me
And it's why I sing
Your praise will
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
Your praise will
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips
You father the orphan
Your kindness makes us whole
And You shoulder our weakness
And Your strength becomes our own
