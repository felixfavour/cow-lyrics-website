[Intro]
You did not suffer for nothing
When You shed Your blood
Every drop was on purpose
What amazing love
[Pre-Chorus]
I will make my boast in Your cross alone
Laying every crown at Your feet
Lamb of God
Worthy is the Lamb of God
Worthy is the Lamb of God
Worthy is the Lamb
[Interlude]
And as You knelt in the garden
Was I on Your mind?
What was the joy set before You?
Was my heart Your prize?
