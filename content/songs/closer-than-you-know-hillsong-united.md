I tempered the storm
Though your faith was small
I prayed while you slept
And the night waged war
We stood at the fire
And we walked on sea
And we drank of the wine
That was made of Me
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't turn your eyes from Me
For My love won't be undone
Don't hide your face from Me
For My light has surely come
Surely come surely come
I carried that cross
And I felt your pain
I took up your crown
And I wore your shame
And death was a fire
And its teeth were grim
But I left it behind
A'Long with all your sin
