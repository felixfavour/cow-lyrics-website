Starlight in a mother's eyes
A Holy Child is born
Kings and shepherds on their knees
Adoring Christ the Lord
Bethlehem Bethlehem
Behold Your beautiful Savior!
Fall down, worship Him
The King born in Bethlehem
He knew the secrets of the world
His lips could not yet speak
Heaven wrapped in flesh and blood
The Son of Majesty
Bethlehem Bethlehem
Behold Your beautiful Savior!
Fall down, worship Him
The King born in Bethlehem
Fall down, worship
The Hope of Israel
Come and adore Him
Jesus, Emmanuel!
