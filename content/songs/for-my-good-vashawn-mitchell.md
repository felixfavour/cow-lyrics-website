[Repeat: x8]
Oh, oh, oh
[Repeat: x2]
I came to tell you it was for my good
All of those times that I was misunderstood
Every affliction
Those situations
They brought me closer to God
Although sometimes I had to cry
He wiped every tear from eye
It was good
For my good
[Repeat: x3]
My troubles
My trials
Only made me strong
My troubles
My trials
Only made me strong
It was good
For my good
Though he slay me
Yet will I trust him
I realized that it was for my good
