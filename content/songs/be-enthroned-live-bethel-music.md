[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We've come to join the song
Sung long before our lives
To raise our voice along
Heaven and earth alike
And we've seen Your faithful hand
Your mercy without end
And a King who bled and died
And a God who sacrificed
And be enthroned upon the praises of a thousand generations
You are worthy, Lord of all
Unto You the slain and risen King
We lift our voice with heaven
Singing worthy, Lord of all
All through this life we lead
And on to eternity
Our endless praise we'll cry
Jesus, be glorified
