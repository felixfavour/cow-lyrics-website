Don't take your joy away
Oh, don't take your joy away, no, no, no
I know that I have done wrong
But I'm asking You as I sing this song
Don't take your joy away
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus: Choir, 
Female Lead
]
Don't take your joy away
(
Your joy away, no, no, don't take
)
Don't take your joy away
(
Your joy, Your joy, I'm asking you, Lord, I know
)
I know that I have done wrong (
But I'm
)
Asking you (
Asking You, Lord, as we sing this song
)
Sing this song
(
Don't take, don't take Your joy, joy away
Don't take Your joy, Lord
)
Don't take your joy away
(
Lord, don't take Your joy from me
I'm asking You, Lord, don't take
)
Don't take your joy away
(
Right now, Jesus, we need You, Lord, yes, we do
Lord, we know
)
I know that I have done wrong (
But I'm asking You, Lord
)
Asking you (
Asking You, Lord, as we sing this song
)
Sing this song (
Don't take it
)
Don't take it (
You see I can't make it
)
I can't make it (
I've tried it
)
I've tried it
(
I've tried it, and I've tried it
)
I can't live without it
(
Lord, I can't live without You
)
Don't take it
(
Lord, don't take Your joy from me, Lord, don't take it
)
I can't make it
(
Lord, I need you to clean me up, make me strong
)
I've tried it
(
Lord, I've tried You and I know You
)
I can't live without it
