[Instrumental]
Wake up the wonder, our redemptions glory
Now is the time for strength to rise
Shake off the failure, we are moving forward
Now is the time for strength to rise
We shall proclaim, unto the One who saves
Jesus, forever we crown You with praise
We shout the name, that will break every chain
Jesus, forever we crown You with praise
Raise up your banner, we are marching onward
Now is the time for strength to rise
Lift up the Savior, He is fighting for us
Now is the time for strength to rise
We shall proclaim, unto the One who saves
Jesus, forever we crown You with praise
We shout the name, that will break every chain
Jesus, forever we crown You with praise
Forever we crown You with praise
