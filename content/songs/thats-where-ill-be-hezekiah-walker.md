That's where I wanna be
Rooted and grounded in Thee
And with Your help, I see
That's where I'll be
Be steadfast and unmovable
Always abounding in the word of God
(That's where I'll be, that's where I'll be)
All other ground I sinking sand
That's what on Christ the solid rock, I stand
(That's where I'll be, that's where I'll be)
That's where I wanna be
Rooted and grounded in Thee
And with Your help, I see
That's where I'll be
Be steadfast and unmovable
Always abounding in the word of God
(That's where I'll be, that's where I'll be)
All other ground I sinking sand
That's what on Christ the solid rock, I stand
(That's where I'll be, that's where I'll be)
