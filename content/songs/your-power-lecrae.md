[Intro: Lecrae]
And by Your power, I know You made a way
And by Your power, I know You made a way
And by Your power, I know You made a way
Yeah, yeah
I need it (I need it)
I need it from moment to moment (I do)
I need it to get where I'm going (I do)
I need it to fight the opponent (Yeah)
The power that move every mountain (Power)
Protect me when evil surround me (Yeah)
I know it's a power living in me
People don't see it, but it's all around me (Woo), yeah
They told me it's over, I'm finished (Done)
But God said, "Just wait and bear witness"He split the red tides, made the dead rise
Just let Him handle His business (Yeah)
They told me, "Confess and believe" (Believe)
I got so much dirt on my knees (My knees)
'Cause I've been talking to the Lord
All day telling Him all of my needs (Praying)
I need mercy, need grace
Need strength, I need faith
Need power 'cause the world's dark
Having trouble seeing Your face (Your face)
All of my life I had to fight
I done got tired of fighting
You gave me life, You gave me light
I got the power to triumph
