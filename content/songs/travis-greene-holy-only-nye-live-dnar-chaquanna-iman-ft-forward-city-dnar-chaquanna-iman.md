I'm not afraid to say I don't know
What I should do or how this will unfold
So many mysteries, but we have history
So I remind my soul
Nobody else can love me like you
You're the only one that can do
What no other god can
You are holy only
Nobody else can be who you are
Stand alone and I stand in awe
Of your matchless power
You are holy only
Holy only God
Never a day that I've been alone
You gave me a key hidden in the name I can call on
Jesus my everything, You still make room for me
So I remind my soul, i remind my soul
Nobody else can love me like you
You're the only one that can do
What no other god can
You are holy only
Nobody else can be who you are
Stand alone and I stand in awe
Of your matchless power
You are holy only
Holy only God
Oh oh oh, you're so holy yeah
We thank you God
Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else
You are holy only
Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else
You are holy only
Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else
You are holy only
Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else
You are holy only
You are holy only (holy only)
You are holy only (holy only)
You are holy holy holy (holy only)
You are holy holy holy (holy only)
