There is  a name higher than all names
There is a name that shatters darkness
There is  a name that overcame the grave
The name of Jesus
[Pre-Chorus]
No, no other name I know
That brings a miracle
The greatest  Name in all the Earth
Oh oh Jesus, Oh oh Jesus
The Name above all names
Oh oh Jesus, Oh oh Jesus
The power of Your name
Is breaking every chain inside of me
There is a Name greater than disease
There is a Name stronger than weakness
There is a Name that makes the blind to see
The name of Jesus
[Bridge]
Your name is wonderful
Your name is beautiful
Your name is powerful, Jesus
Youâ€™re breaking every chain inside of me
