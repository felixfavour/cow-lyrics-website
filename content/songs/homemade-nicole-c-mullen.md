Riding the city bus on the way to school
Me and my two sisters and all the ridicule
The older girls on the back of the bus
Would laugh and call us names
They'd talk about our hair, our clothes
And call us homemade
See the "not so good ole days"
Can make you weak or make you brave
And I've never been the most beautiful
No I ain't never been the most popular
But it's amazing what love can do
It's amazing what a little love can do
Every thought and action
Is like a boomerang
What goes around will come back baby
So careful what you say
And the little ugly ducklings
Are swans that got away
Cause Cinderella stories
They still happen everyday
