I know right where I'm turning
When trouble's on every side
The lesson I keep on learning is I just need You
I may never know every reason
Why things are the way they are
Oh, I don't need all the answers, I just need You
Shelter
I need Your shelter
Hide me away from the harm
Away from it all
I'm safe here in Your loving arms
I need Your shelter
Whatever the future's holding
Whatever tomorrow brings
One thing I know is certain, I just need You
Sheltеr
I need Your shelter
Hide mе away from the harm
Away from it all
I'm safe here in Your loving arms
I need Your shelter
Oh, I need Your shelter
Hide me away from the harm
Away from it all
I'm safe here in Your loving arms
