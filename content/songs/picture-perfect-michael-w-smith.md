Pull all your hair up
Dab on the make up
Tryin' hard to look so pristine
Like a face in a magazine
Those fancy dressers
Media pressure
Got you feelin' so plain and small
If you don't look like a paper doll
In a world where the goal is
To be like the Jones'
It's guaranteed to drive you wild
Keepin' up with the latest style
Gaze in the mirror
You want the glamor
And the grace of a movie star
But I like you the way you are
You are the only one I'm dreamin' of
'Cause baby don't you know that I love
You, girl
You don't have to be picture perfect
To be in my world
Girl
You don't have to be picture perfect
To fit the frame
