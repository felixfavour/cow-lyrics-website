If My people who are called by My Name
Will humble themselves and pray
Seek My face and turn from their wicked ways
I will hear from Heaven
Forgive their sins and heal their land
If My people will humble themselves and pray
Return to Me and I will return to you
You will be My people
And I will be your God
Return to Me and I will return to you
I'll give you a heart to know Me
And I will be your God
If My people will humble thеmselves and pray
As Your peoplе we have turned and walked away (Yes we have)
From the truth from the light from the way
We confess we have failed
We humble our hearts today
Will you hear from Heaven
Forgive our sins and heal our land
As Your people we humble our hearts and pray
