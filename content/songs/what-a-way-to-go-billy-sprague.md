The radio news said he was 22
Another case of “the good die young”
Life can be so unkind
Everybody gotta go sometime
But I won’t be sad when this life is done
'Cause when it comes for me, I know I will be
With the One who has given His life for me
And we’ll be face to face as our hearts embrace
There’ll be loving and laughter in the hereafter
I know I gotta die
But, brother, what a way to go
Living in a mansion
Walking down those streets of gold
I’ll be living in a land
Where love never gets old
Yeah, I know I gotta die
But, brother, what a way to go
What a way to go
When you hear I’m gone
Don’t cry for too long
You’ve got to remember this is not my home
So, don’t take it as bad news
Put on your dancing shoes
You know that I’m ready when I have to go
