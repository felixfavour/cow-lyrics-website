Jesus,bright as the morning star
Jesus how can I tell you how beautiful you are to me
Jesus the song that the angel sing
Jesus dearer to my heart than anything
sweeter than spring time , purer than sunshine
ever my song will be
Jesus you're beautiful to me
oh oh oh  you are  so beautiful
so beautiful
so beautiful
so beautiful Jesus you are so beautiful to me
