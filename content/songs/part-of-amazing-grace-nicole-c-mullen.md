There is a place I keep for the memories
Of the wonders You have done
Dreams I have seen coming true, hey
But there are those who simply cannot believe
That the credit for each one
I give completely to You
See, they may say that it's just
Merely coincidence or chance
Yet I see how your hand
Moves in every situation
That I'm facin'
Every word, every touch is telling me
This life I'm livin' You've given so I can see
That my heart is a part of amazing grace
Truly amazing
Though the days and the years may come and go
I still discover more love in the ways You show
That my heart is a part of amazing grace
I love to see how everything
Moves and breathes
In a pattern You designed
Just as You knew that it would
But when I think about its complexities
It's a miracle to find
You're working all for my good
