Jesus IYE
You have done it again

I Almost gave up
When it seemed it was Impossible
When the Odds were up against me 
And there was No Way
It seemed Allover
Then You Spoke into the Dry Bones 
What was Impossible
(Baba) You made Possible.

VERSE 2
I almost let go,
When the violent storm was raging
And the night was long and lonely
it looked like there was no hope
Then I cried unto you
and you spoke into the darkness
What was impossible, You made Possible
Jesus Iye
Jesus IYE
You have done it again
Jesus IYE
In Your Special Way
What was Impossible
(Baba) You made Possible
Jesus IYE.
