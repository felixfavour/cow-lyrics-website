Create in me a clean heart
And purify me, purify me
Create in me a clean heart
So I may worship thee, everybody say it
Create in me a clean heart
And purify me
Create in me a clean heart
So I may worship thee
Say it now, say it now
Create in me a clean heart
And purify me
Create in me a clean heart
So I may worship thee
Cast me not away from thy presence
Please don't take your Spirit from me
And restore the joy of salvation
So that I may worship thee
Please Lord God...
Create in me a clean heart
And purify me
Create in me a clean heart
So I may worship thee
