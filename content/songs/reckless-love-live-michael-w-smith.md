[Intro]
Are you ready?
We're gonna celebrate the goodness of God tonight
Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
And You have been so, so kind to me
And oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
And oh, it chases me down, fights ’til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
And I couldn't earn it, and I don’t deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
And oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
And You have been so, so kind to me
Come on let me hear you singing as [?]
And oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
And oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
And I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
And oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
