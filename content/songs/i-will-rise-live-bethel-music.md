In the quiet of the morning
When no one knows and no one needs to know
You speak to me, You give me strength
There's nothing like the secret place
Underground is where life begins
My heart will rejoice in the hiddenness
Beyond the burial, there's a resurrection
Your will be done in me
In the stillness all around
Where You are working all the details out
What's in me will grow someday
I trust Your timing and Your ways
Underground is where life begins
My heart will rejoice in the hiddenness
Beyond the burial, there's a resurrection
Your will be done in me
Oh-oh, let my roots go deep
[Bridge]
And I will rise, I will rise
He holds the time that I will rise
I will rise, I will rise
He holds the time that I will rise
I will rise, I will rise
God, through my life, be lifted high
I will rise, I will rise
God, through my life, be lifted high
Let Jesus rise in this place, let Jesus rise
God, through my life, be glorified
Sing it, sing it, sing it
Let Jesus rise, Jesus rise
God, through my life, be glorified
Sing it
Let Jesus rise, Jesus rise
God, through my life, be glorified
Let Jesus rise, Jesus rise
God, through my life, be glorified, sing it
Let Jesus rise, Jesus rise
God, through my life, be glorified
