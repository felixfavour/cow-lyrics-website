I have watched how You drove back the sea
That swallowed up my every fear
I have walked from the shore to the deep
And through it all, You were there
[Pre-Chorus]
Mighty Redeemer, strong to deliver
You are the great I AM
We crown You with every crown
For the way You saved us
Crown You with every crown
For the way You love us
High King of Heaven
We crown You the Lord of all
I have watched how You led through the wild
A cloud by day and fire by night
Guiding me to Your promised land
Every step, by my side
[Pre-Chorus]
Mighty Redeemer, strong to deliver
Oh, You are the great I AM
