Feels like I've been down to the river
You washed away all my shame
No longer bound because I'm forgiven
I've been made free from sin's guilty stain
You gave your life for me that I might be saved
You changed my destiny with the awesome price you paid, now I can say
Old things are passed away
All things are new
I'm not the same
Yes I've been changed, Yeah
It's true I found my life in you
All things are new
I'm not the same
Yes I've been changed, Yeah
Mind's renewed no longer a sinner
No greater love have I ever known
And I've got power to walk like a winner
Though I may fail he still calls me his own
You gave your life for me that I might be saved
You changed my destiny with the awesome price you paid, now I can say
Old things are passed away
All things are new
I'm not the same
Yes I've been changed, Yeah
It's true I found my life in you
All things are new
I'm not the same
Yes I've been changed, Yeah (2)
Since He changed me (since he changed me)
I'll never (never)
Be the same
He changed me (he changed me)
And I'll never (never)
Be the same
He changed me (since he changed me)
I'll never (never)
Be the same
He changed me (he changed me)
I'll never (never)
Be the same
Old things are passed away
All things are new
I'm not the same
Yes I've been changed, Yeah
It's true I found my life in you
All things are new
I'm not the same
Yes I've been changed, Yeah (2)
Since he changed me
I'll never be the same
He changed me
And I'll never be the same
He changed me (he changed me)
I'll never (never)
Be the same
