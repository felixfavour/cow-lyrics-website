[Intro: Spoken]
And I love the Cross. I love the fact that when Jesus died on the Cross it meant we could come before him with boldness. Because when that veil was torn in two, it give us this access, it gives us this moment, these moments that we life for. His presence comes and hovers and we can feel it. Aren't you so thankful for Jesus? Aren't you so thankful for the price that He paid on the Cross, to pay for our sin and give us mercy and grace? But more than that, a love that He wanted us, He wants us, He loves to be with us. Will you lift your hands for a moment? I just want you to tune in to that for a moment of just saying, "God, I thank You for the Cross." There's no one like You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord. We press into You tonight, Lord. We love Your presence, we love You, we love You
The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead
The Savior of the world was fallen
His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us
The weight of every curse upon him
One final breath He gave
As Heaven looked away
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged
The power of hell forever broken
[Pre-Chorus]
The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away
His perfect love could not be overcome
Now death where is your sting
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated
