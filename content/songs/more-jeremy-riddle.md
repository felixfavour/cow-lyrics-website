I am waiting, like the desert
For Your rain, for Your rain
I am bracing, like the shoreline
For Your waves, Your coming waves
'Cause when You move, I can't recover
I get wrecked when I rediscover
More, more
When You speak, I see new colors
And all my heart longs to uncover
More, more
I am reaching, hands toward Heaven
So undone, so undone
You've awakened, You're reshaping
My heart with Yours, my heart with Yours
'Cause when You move, I can't recover
I get wrecked when I rediscover
More, more
When You speak, I see new colors
And all my heart longs to uncover
More, more
'Cause when You move, I can't recover
I get wrecked when I rediscover
More, more
When You speak, I see new colors
And all my heart longs to uncover
More, more
