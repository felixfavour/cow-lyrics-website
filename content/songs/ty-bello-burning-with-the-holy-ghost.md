Who are we to call for fire and not be consumed
Oh Oh Oh Covered by blood
Alive
There's a fresh outpouring
No one can stop it
No one can stop it
Spirit is moving
Nothing can stop it
Nothing can stop it
Alive are the flame
We are burning
With the holy ghost
oh Oh , Our lives are refreshing
With the Holy Ghost
Oh Oh, We are burning, burning, burning, Burning
With the Holy Ghost
Oh Oh, We are burning, burning, burning, Burning
With the Holy Ghost
There's a fire that's burning
No man can stop it
Fire is burning
No man can stop it
Oh Oh, We are burning, burning, Burning
Burning, With the Holy Ghost
Oh Oh, We are burning, burning, Burning , Burning with the Holy Ghost
Oh oh oh This river has come
To me
Every heart that is ready to be burning with the Holy Ghost
Ehn Ehn Ehn Ehn Ehn Ehn Ehn Ehn
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Turn my heart to you
Let your fire burn
Thank you for your fire in us
Oh oh, you've taken over us
The fire is burning
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
The fire
