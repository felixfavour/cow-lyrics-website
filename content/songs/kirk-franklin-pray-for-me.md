Pray for me
I'm afraid that I'm about to lose it all
Pray for me
I don't need gravity for tears to fall
You can keep your fancy words, and call it lies
Nothing super spiritual, not this time
Just pray for me
Cuz judging me's not helping me to grow
Pray for me
See the wrong I've done, I already know
Will you love me if I'm dirty and I've lost my way
To the blood that's washed me white and I'm no longer gray
If I don't need your approval will you let me stay
And pray for me
Pray for me (x4)
Please pray for me
Our father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done on earth
As it is in heaven
Give us our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those that trespass against us
Lord lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom
Power, and glory
Forever, we're asking you to
