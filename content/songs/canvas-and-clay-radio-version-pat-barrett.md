In my mother's womb
You formed me with Your hands
Known and loved by You
Before I took a breath
And when I doubt it, Lord, remind me
I'm wonderfully made
'Cause You're an artist and a potter
I'm the canvas and the clay
And You make all things work together
For my future and for my good
And You make all things work together
For Your glory and for Your name, yeah
There's a healing light
Just beyond the clouds
Though I've walked through fire
Oh, I see clearly now
And I know nothing has been wasted
No failure or mistake
'Cause You're an artist and a potter
I'm the canvas and thе clay
