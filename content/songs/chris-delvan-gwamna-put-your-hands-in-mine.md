i can see
gear in your eyes
I can hear
confusion in the word you speak
let me tell you know
if it's true love that you are looking for
I know a place
where the river never seize to flow
let me take you to a place I know
let me take you to the one I love
would you put your hands in mine?
put your hands in mine
no one knows the way
that leads on to eternal life
no one seen his face
but the son came from heaven above
if you let him in
he will move the things that he can move
someone gat to lead you there
and the many of the good things in life
so let me take you to the place I know
let me bring you to the one I love
would you put your hands in mine?
would you put your hands in mine?(x5)
I know the light
that the world so dearly needs to see
and I have seen the hope
that the prophet prophecy about
is why I tell you know
if it's this love that you are looking for
then I know a place
that the river never seize to flow
so let me take you to the place I know
let me take you to the one I love
would you put your hands in mine?
would you put your hands in mine?(x5)
