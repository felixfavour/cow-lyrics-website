Be not dismayed, fear not the darkness
Jesus is here, He walks beside us
Gracious is He, through all our weakness
Forever faithful, forever good

Emmanuel, Emmanuel
God with us, living inside
Emmanuel

Lift up our eyes, to the Maker of Heaven
He is our help, forever present
Faithful is He, He is our constant
Forever faithful, forever good

Emmanuel, Emmanuel
God with us, living inside
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
God with us, living inside
Emmanuel

No matter what, what storm may come
Our God is here, Our God is here
When fear gives in, when darkness runs
Our God is here, Our God is here
No matter what, what storm may come
Our God is here, Our God is here
When fear gives in, when darkness runs
Our God is here, His name

Emmanuel, Emmanuel
God with us (us), living inside (living inside)
Emmanuel, Emmanuel
God with us (us), living inside
Emmanuel
God with us, mm
His name, Emmanuel
