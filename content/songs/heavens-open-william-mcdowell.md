[Chorus]
I hear the sound of rain,
coming
I hear the sound of rain,
coming
Come on come on do you hear it
I hear the sound of rain,
coming
It’s coming ya’ll
I hear the sound of rain,
coming
I wanna know do you hear it
Come on somebody say it again say
I hear the sound of rain,
Coming
Come on can you sense it in the atmosphere
I hear the sound of rain,
Coming
I hear the sound
I hear the sound,
of revival coming
Yes lord
I hear the sound,
of revival coming
