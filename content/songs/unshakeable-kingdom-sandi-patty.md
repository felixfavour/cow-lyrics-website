They came to follow Him
Drawn by what He promised them
If they would sell all that they had
He said that God would send a kingdom
That would never end
Where all the poor would be so rich
And in their discontent
They heard what they thought He meant
They heard that the weak would be strong
Bread would be multiplied
And hunger be satisfied
And every servant a king
In his kingdom of God
A kingdom that would never end
A living unshakeable kingdom of God
But He went His quiet way
Giving himself away
Building what eyes could never see
While men looked for crowns and thrones
He walked with crowds alone
Planting a seed in you and me
Crying for those who cried
Dying for those who died
Bursting forth glorified! Alive!
And some of them looked for Him
Sad that it had to end
But some dared to look within and see
The kingdom of God
A kingdom that would never end
The living, unshakeable kingdom of God
