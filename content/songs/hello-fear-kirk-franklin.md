Hello Fear
Before you sit down there's something I need to explain
Since you're here
I think I should tell you since we last talked things have changed
See I'm tired of being broken-hearted
So I made a list and you're on it
All my hopes and my dreams You took from me
I want those back before you leave
Hello Fear
I knew I would see you, You have a hard time letting go
See these tears,Take a good look cuz, soon they won't fall anymore
God's healing my 
hurful
 places
That seat that was yours now is taken
I'm no longer afraid,See I'm better this way
And one more thing before you leave
Never again will I love you
My heart it refuses to be your home
No longer your prisoner
Today I remember
Apart from you is where I belong
And never again will I trust you
I'm tired of fighting it's been way too long
No longer your prisoner
