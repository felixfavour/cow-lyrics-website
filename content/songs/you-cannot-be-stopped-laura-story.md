The dark tried to hide You and steal You away
Death tried to keep You inside of the grave
The enemy fought You, he tried but he lost
You cannot be stopped (You cannot be stopped)
When we cried for freedom, You tore down the walls
The weight of our burdens, You carried it all
Our fears and our failures hang dead on the cross
You cannot be stopped
Mover of mountains, breaker of chains
Jesus has triumphed over the grave
Sing hallelujah, the battle is won
Nothing can stand against our God
We stand on Your victory, we shout out Your praise
Miracle maker, You're mighty to save
Awesome in power, relentless in love, oh-oh
You cannot be stopped
Mover of mountains, breaker of chains
Jesus has triumphed over the grave
Sing hallelujah, the battle is won
Nothing can stand against our God
