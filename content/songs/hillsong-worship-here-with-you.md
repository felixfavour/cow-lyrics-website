When sunlight breaks
And the day has just begun
In the still I wait
For Your voice to lead me on
Eternity residing in my soul, oh-oh
I'll follow You 'til the day You call me home
Here now with You
I have Heaven in me
Everything's changed
And I will never be without You
Without You
From the dust I'm made
With Your calling on my life
And Your plan weaved
Into the fabric of my heart
Eternity residing in my soul, oh-oh
I lift my eyes to the One who gave it all
I lift my eyes to the One who gave it all
Here now with You
I have Heaven in me
Everything's changed
And I will never be without You
And always with You
Through Your Spirit in me
Everything's changed
And I will never be without You
Without You
(I'll never be without You Lord)
Here now with You
I have Heaven in me
Everything's changed
And I will never be without You
And always with You
Through Your Spirit in me
Everything's changed
And I will never be without You
You see me in the fire
Reaching out with open hands
You find me on my knees
Fill me with Your peace again
Forever I am loved
And freedom reigns in me
Forever You are Lord
My everything
(Here now)
Here now with You
I have Heaven in me
Everything's changed
And I will never be without You
And always with You
Through Your Spirit in me
Everything's changed
And I will never be without You
And I will never be without You
And I will never be without You
Without You
