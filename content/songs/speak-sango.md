Most of the time I was speakin' my mind
I wasn't listening that often, I had so little to offer
Spent a lot thinkin' of these things and I finally see what it cost me
You had a hold on me but I'm finally free from exhaustion
Freedom of speech, now we talkin'
But always say less than what's necessary
Did you get my messages?
They were heaven sent, keep us safe from the adversary
These lessons, I soaked 'em in 'til they resonate
I'm in a better place and didn't have to get buried
To get here, let that marinate
Let the deaf hear it, let the blind see it
[Chorus: Leuca]
Heavenly Father, Where do I start?
There's so many things to get off my chest, speak to my heart
Heavenly Father, Where do I start?
There's so many things to get off my chest, speak to my heart
Heavenly Father, Where do I start?
There's so many things to get off my chest, speak to my heart
Heavenly Father, Where do I start?
There's so many things to get off my chest, speak to my heart
[Bridge: Joose The Conqueror]
Now it's been a long time since I felt this way
Living my whole life in the dark
Someone now, someone now
Feel like the moon in the blue night sky, when it shines
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh,  ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
