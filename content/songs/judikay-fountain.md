Oh, oh, oh There's a fire ablaze in my heart This world would hear That you're the only way The truth and life There is a sound Coming from my depth This world would sing That only you truly satisfy There's a fire ablaze in my heart This world would hear That you're the only way The truth and life There is a sound Coming from my depth This world would sing That only you truly satisfy Rivers of living water You are the fountain That won't run dry Jesus... Rivers of living water You are the fountain That won't run dry Oooooh Fountain that won't run dry Foun-tain that won't run dry Fountain that won't run dry You are the fountain That won't run dry
Life giving river Cup of satisfaction I have drank And would never thirst again You flow though me As a spring of water Welling up to eternal life I have drank And would never thirst again Again, again Fountain that won't run dry Foun-tain that won't run dry Fountain that won't run dry You are the fountain That won't run dry
Out of my belly now flows Rivers of living water Out of my belly now flows Rivers of living water Out of my belly now flows Rivers of living water I am a fountain that won't run dry Out of my belly now flows Rivers of living water Out of my belly now flows Rivers of living water Out of my belly now flows Rivers of living water I am a fountain that i can never ever run dry Jesus, I will drink till I'm drunk Come, O ye that thirst There is a fountain This fountain never runs dry Jesus will fill you up He will fill you up with his fire He will fill you up with his life Come, come, come Come and Drink
