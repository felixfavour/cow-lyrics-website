This is to my friend above
Who shows me so much love and grace
By placing a smile upon my face
It's so hard to express the way I feel
About a man who I know who can heal your life
By dying on a cross
For sinners who were lost
Lord, I love you so much
That I'm yearning for Your touch
This is to my friend above
Who shows me so much love and grace
By placing a smile upon my face
It's so hard to express the way I feel
About a man who can heal your life
By dying on a cross
For sinners who were lost
And while I'm here today
There's just one thing that I want to say
Watch over me and protect me
From the things I cannot see
Let Your loving arms surround me
From here to eternity
Lord I need Your anointing
So my spirit can be free
Lord I need You more
And more and more, and more
