When I think of the things you do for me and the way that you blessed and cared for me oh
Lord my mouth would sing like a symphony
Hallelujah Hallelujah
For the battles that you have fought for me
And all the victories that you gave me to me oh
Daddy I cannot help but tell it all, Hallelujah Hallelujah
Iyo Iyo
Halle Halle Halle
Hallelujah
Halle Halle Halle
Hallelujah
Halle Halle Halle
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
To the one who reigns
If I have ten thousand tongues
Lord it won't be enough, even with silver or gold, it still won't be enough.
But I've come to worship you, and to show my gratitude, Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Iyo yo yo
Agamé bura Hallelujah buru
Agamé para Hallelujah para oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Agamé bura Hallelujah buru eh
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Iyo Iyo
Halle Halle Halle
Hallelujah
Halle Halle Halle
Hallelujah
Halle Halle Halle
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
To the one who reigns
