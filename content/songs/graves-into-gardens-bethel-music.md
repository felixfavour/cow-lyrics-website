I searched the world
But it couldn't fill me
Man's empty praise
And treasures that fade
Are never enough
Then You came along
And put me back together
Every desire
Is now satisfied
Here in Your love
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
I'm not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws
Lord, You've seen them all
And You still call mе friend
'Cause the God of thе mountain
Is the God of the valley
There's not a place
Your mercy and grace
Won't find me again
