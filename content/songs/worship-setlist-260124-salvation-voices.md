There is no one greater
There is no one greater
There is no one greater than Jehovah Lord divine.

Who is greater than Jehovah Lord divine,
There is no one greater than Jehovah Lord divine.

Excellent Jehovah, marvelous Jehovah,
There is no one greater than Jehovah Lord divine.

O be lifted above all other gods,
We lay our crowns and worship You.
O glorious God, we praise Your name,
We lay our crowns and worship You.

When the Spirit of the Lord is upon my life,
I will dance like David danced.
I will dance, I will dance,
I will dance like David danced.
I will sing, I will sing,
I will sing like David sang.

Ijile ninu ijile eshehun oo,
Ana mi soro, oni mi soro,
Ola mi a soro.
Eru wa bami l’aye mi o,
Ese wa s’are o, ore ofe mi wa o.

Oshe wun tuntun laye mi
[I received a new blessing in my life]
Ko dawo duro, aanu ni mo re gba
[It did not stop, I received it by mercy]

Baba modupe, baba modupe
[Father, I give thanks, Father, I give thanks]
Fun gbogbo ore ti mo ri gba
[For all the goodness I have received]

Amara chi, Ogbaruba ne bem no,
[The grace of God, the mighty one who dwells with me.]

Na You wey dy carry my matter for Your head,
And You promise never ever ever let me bend.

Amarachi Ogbaruba ne bem no,
[The grace of God, the mighty one who dwells with me.]

Now unto the One upon the Throne
We raise a sound
We raise a sound
For He is God and God alone
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Now unto the One upon the Throne
We raise a sound
We raise a sound
From every Nation, Tribe and Tongue
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
For He is worthy
To receive glory, honour and praise
Now Unto the One upon the Throne
We raise a sound
We raise a sound
For He is worthy
To receive glory, honour and praise
Now Unto the One upon the Throne
We raise a sound
We raise a sound
