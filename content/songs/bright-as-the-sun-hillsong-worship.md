O how sweet did You gaze
On my perilous heart
To befriend me to my bitter end
And carry the burden
For as graven my failure
You prevailed in pure love
To be found in the depths of Your heart
As good as forgiven
O how You graced that cross
Where Jesus died and death took the loss
Wild as the floodgates of heaven
Flung wide open within His scars
Now mine is the life You raised
Yours the glory that took down that grave
Bright as the sun almighty in love
God forever Your Kingdom come
O how sweet is the sound
Of a heart drenched in grace
Rising up from the ashes in praise
Alive to Your greatness
