It was meant to kill me
Sent to destroy me
And I thought that it would
And I thought that it should
'Cause I messed up so many times
I went left when you said right
I'll understand if you wanna let me go
But ou held on to me
And you wouldn't me go
And you wouldn't me go
But you held on to me
And you wouldn't me go
And you wouldn't me go
And what the enemy meant for evil
God has worked it out, for my good
What the enemy meant for evil
God has worked it out, for my good
What the enemy meant for evil
God has worked it out, for my good
Yeah, it was meant to kill
Sent to destroy me
And I thought that it would
And I thought that it should
'Cause I messed up so many times
I went left when you said right
I'll understand if you wanna let me go
But you held on to me
And you wouldn't me go
And you wouldn't me go
But you held on to me
And you wouldn't me go
And you wouldn't me go
And what the enemy meant for evil
God has worked it out, for my good
What the enemy meant for evil
God has worked it out, for my good
What the enemy meant for evil
God has worked it out, for my good
Listen, I need you to know
That whatever you're goin' through
God has the ability to use it for his glory
He doesn't waste anything
If you went through it, he can use it
It's workin', it's workin'
It's workin', it's workin'
I need you to know that it's workin', it's workin'
It was meant to kill me but it's workin' for me
It's workin', it's workin'
Tell somebody it's workin, it's workin'
Encourage somebody, it's workin'
I know it seems hard but just hand in there
I promise you it's workin', it's workin'
Everything that you face, it's workin'
Every heartbreakin' trial, it's workin'
It was meant to kill me but it's workin' for me
It's workin', it's workin'
I know it don't feel like it, it's workin'
I know it don't look like it, it's workin'
But he's able to do it
It's workin', it's workin'
It's workin', it's workin'
It's workin', it's workin'
Do you believe it?
It was meant to kill me but it's workin' for me
I said that it's workin', it's workin'
It's workin', it's workin'
I need you to believe, it's workin'
And receive it, that He's making all things work together
It's workin', it's workin'
For the promises of God, it's workin'
Oh yes and Amen, it's workin'
If he did it before
It was meant to kill me but it's workin' for me
He can do it again, it's workin'
It's workin', it's workin'
Your new season is here, it's workin'
And what the enemy meant for evil
God has worked it out, for my good, oh oh
What was mean to kill me
It only made me better
