B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-E-D
B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm bursting on the right
& I'm bursting on the left
no need for me to struggle
cos I'm functioning from rest
this thing's are meant to follow
cos I'm putting the kingdom first
God said it & it is settled
I'm not settling for rest
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
B-L-E-S-S-E-D
when thing's don't seem to tally
with the thing's that God has said
it is not a time to panic
& all this giants, I call them bread
I can never be a victim
when I'm living the life in Christ
but Satan is defeated & I'm the seed of Abraham
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
B-L-E-S-S-E-D
(say)  hmmnn.... hmmn... hmmmn..
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm  B-L-E-S-S-E-D
in the morning
in the evening
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
in my going
in my coming
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
in the field
& in the city
I'm  B-L-E-S-S-E-D
in season
out of season
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
huh.. huh.. huh.. huh...
B-L-E-S-S-E-D (neh neh neh neh)
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
anything I lay my hands on
it is always a success
I already know the outcome
brother, what do you expect
the enemy can not stop me
cos I know just who I am
i'm a joint heir with Jesus Christ
I'm the seed of Abraham
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm rich without the sorrow
I'm living in perfect health
surely, goodness & mercy follow
as long as I remain on earth
all thing's work in my favour
I'm above & not beneath
I'm planted by the water side, I'm not bothered by the heat
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
in the morning
in the evening
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
in the morning
in the evening
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
(tell them, tell them) B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
(say it, say it)
in the  morning
in the evening
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
in my going
in my coming
I'm  B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm walking * mountain
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm spreading like a fountain
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
in the field
& in the city
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
in season
out of season
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
I'm blessed with gold & silver
I'm B-L-E-S-S-E-D
joy flowing like a river
I'm  B-L-E-S-S-E-D
(repeat it)
I'm blessed
in the morning
