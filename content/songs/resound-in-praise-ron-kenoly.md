We've been created
As kings and priests
To worship You royalty
To proclaim
Your awesome mighty works
Your excellence for all to see
Heaven and earth
Reflect Your glory
The sun, moon and stars
Give You praise
You are the great
And Mmghty God
Forever Your kingdom will reign
Will reign
Let the sanctuary
Be filled with Your glory
We lift our voices up in praise
Let the sanctuary
Be filled with Your glory
Each instrument resound in praise
Let the sanctuary
Be filled with Your glory
We lift our voices up in praise
Let the sanctuary
Be filled with Your glory
Each instrument resound in praise
