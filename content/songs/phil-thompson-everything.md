"Everything"
Let our praise
Rise above our burdens and our pain
They tremble at the mention of Your name
King Jesus, You're my Redeemer
Let our praise
Rise above our bondage and restraint
Only You can loosen every chain
King Jesus, You're my Redeemer
There's no one like You
No one beside You
Cause You are everything
Yes, You are everything
There's no one like You
No one beside You
Cause You are everything
Yes, You are everything
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Let our praise
Rise above our bondage and restraint
Only You can loosen every chain
King Jesus, You're my Redeemer
There's no one like You
No one beside You
Cause You are everything
Yes, You are everything
There's no one like You
No one beside You
Cause You are everything
Yes, You are everything
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
You are my everything
There's none like You, no one
You are my everything
There's none like You, no one
You are my everything
There's none like You, no one
You are my everything
There's none like You
There's no one like You
No one beside You
Cause You are everything
Yes, You are everything
There's no one like You
No one beside You
Cause You are everything
Yes, You are everything
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
