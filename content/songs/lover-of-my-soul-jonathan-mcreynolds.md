Their human bones
Are as fragile as mine
I have my flaws
But they have the same kind
I was ashamed
Cause I couldn't see
But grace says that they're
In the same boat as me
But what I lack
You are full of
Where I'm broken
You are whole
What I'm doubting
You are sure of
So I'll trust the lover
Lover of my soul
I'm not afraid
Of the arrows by day
nor the darkness that comes
When the sun rolls away
Lord you know that
My strength never lasts
You make up for
Every weakness I have
What I lack
You are full of
Where I'm broken
You are whole
What I'm doubting
You are sure of
I'll trust the lover
Lover of my soul
What I lack
You are full of
Where I'm broken
You are whole
What I'm doubting
You are sure of
I'll trust the lover
Lover of my soul
What I lack
You are full of
Where I'm broken
You are whole
What I'm doubting
You are sure of
I'll trust the lover
Lover of my soul
What I confess
You will cover
What I let go
You'll control
Lord my hope is
In no other
I'll trust the lover
Lover of my soul
