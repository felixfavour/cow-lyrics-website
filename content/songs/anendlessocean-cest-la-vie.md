C'est la vie
C'est la vie
High or low, good or bad
you are here with me
comfortably, you comfort me
i come cynical but i leave optimist
you make optimist
direction and guidance
up in your atmosphere your ambience
you hol' up in your energy vibrant
yea you pull me out of the wastelands
I will not be silent
until i until i pile up
my praise up to the sky
stack 'em up to like your knees
do me anyhow, anyway you please
Okaka! Okaka run me your formula
Aga m e buru alleluia e buru
I no fit find you in vain
you re right there beside me
I know wouldnt wanna live a day without you
2ce
I confess to you i no see
No better love there is no replacement for you for me
Get hold get hold on me
you make top list
you are top of this
Direction nd guidance....
