Thought it was the end this time
God said "Not yet"I thought that I would lose my mind
God said "Not yet"Thinkin' 'bout my yesterday
Wondering how I got away
But death heard Jesus say
That he said "Not yet"Just when I was gonna quit
God said "Not yet"I said let somebody else have the place
But he said "Not yet"I thought that I had done so wrong
Feeling like my time was gone but
God gave me this song to tell you
"Not yet", oh yes
I can't die right now
I got work to do
I can't waste no time
And he brought me through
Heaven can wait for me
I got a destiny
And I'm walking in victory
God said "Not yet"
