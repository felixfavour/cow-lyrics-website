Would you believe me if i said...
That we are the ones who can make the change
In the world today....
Would you believe me if i said
That all of the dreams in your heart
Can come true.....today...
Would you believe me if i said...
That life could be all that you want it to be ...today...
And if i had wings i would fly
'cause all that i need You are
And if the world caved in around me
To You i'd still hold on
'cause Your all that i believe
And the one that created me
Jesus.... because of You i'm Free
Would you belive me if i said...
That God can make miracles happen today..
Would you believe me if i said....
That you don't need to wait for the answer before...
You step out in faith
Would you believe me if i said...
That nothin is ever impossible.. for God
