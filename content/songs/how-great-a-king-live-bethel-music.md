You reached from the sky
Leaving heaven's throne
I was meant to die
You wouldn't let me go
The riches of Your grace
I could not afford
My guilt has been erased
Now I'm forever Yours
[Chorus: Paul McClure & Hannah McClure]
And oh, what a price You paid
Trading the highest place
You laid down Your crown for me
How great a King
From death, life has begun
A garden from the grave
Bursting through the night
Yours is the victory
Oh, from death, life has begun
A garden from the grave
You're bursting through the night
Yours is the victory
