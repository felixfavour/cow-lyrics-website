I was lost and could not see
But You did not give up on me
To save me from my guilt and shame
You stepped into the world You made
And on the cross of Calvary (Oh, oh-oh)
You gave Your life to set me free (Oh, oh-oh)
Forever I will sing Your name (Oh, oh-oh)
Hands high, heart full of praise (Oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-ooh)
(Oh-ooh)
The King of Glory once enthroned
Was laid to rest behind the stone
But death would not have final say (Oh, oh, oh)
Jesus, You rose from the grave
And now standing in Your victory
Your Spirit is alive in me
Forever I will sing Your name
Hands high, heart full of praise (Praise)
Oh-oh
Heart full of praise
Oh-ooh
