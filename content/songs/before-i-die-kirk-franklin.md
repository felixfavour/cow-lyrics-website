[Intro]
C'mon
Brothers and sisters
I'm feelin' real good 'cause it ain't over
Right before I die, I gotta live-
Live out my dreams
So, I can be what He planned for me
Not just for me, but so they can see
Much more of Him and less of-
Right before I die I gotta
Love my enemies, forgive the past
And set 'em free so I can free
Free up the things
Every blessing God has for me
See it's for me, not just for you
 (Oww!)
I had to learn from what I've been through
I can't go through that way again
 (Uh)
Be hurt by You that way again
It's not the end
 (No, no)
[Pre-Chorus]
I used to be afraid to die
I used to be afraid to try
 (Used to be afraid)
'Cause I was too afraid of knowing
What failing looked like
 (But the Son)
But the Son came to give me life
Now I feel like I can touch the sky
 (Ha, ha)
I'm ready if you're ready
 (Ha, ha)
If you're ready
