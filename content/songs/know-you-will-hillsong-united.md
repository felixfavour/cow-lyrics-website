When the road runs dead, You can see a way I don't
And it makes no sense, but You say that's what faith is for
When I see a flood, You see a promise
When I see a grave, You see a door
And when I'm at my end, You see where the future starts
I don't know how You make a way, but I know You will
I don't know how You make a way, but I know You will
You've been good on every promise
From Eden to Zion
Through every dead end
And out of that grave
I don't know how You make a way, but I know You will
When the world's on fire, it's not like You don't have a plan
And when the earth gives way, on this Rock Your church will stand
And nothing has ever once surprised You
Nothing has ever made You flinch
And when it all shakes out, the gates of Hell don't stand a chance
I don't know how You make a way, but I know You will
I don't know how You make a way, but I know You will
You've been good on every promise
From Eden to Zion
Through every dead end
And out of that grave
I don't know how You make a way, but I know You will
