VERSE 1:
O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem!
Come, and behold Him, born the King of angels!

CHORUS:
O come, let us adore Him;
O come, let us adore Him;
O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!

VERSE 2:
God of God, Light of Light,
lo, He abhors not the virgin's womb;
very God, begotten not created; 

CHORUS:
O come, let us adore Him;
O come, let us adore Him;
O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!

VERSE 3:
Sing, choirs of angels; sing in exultation;
sing, all ye citizens of heav'n above!
Glory to God, all glory in the highest!

CHORUS:
O come, let us adore Him;
O come, let us adore Him;
O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!

VERSE 4:
Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, born this happy morning;
Jesus, to Thee be all glory giv'n!
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing! 

CHORUS:
O come, let us adore Him;
O come, let us adore Him;
O come, let us adore Him, Christ, the Lord!
