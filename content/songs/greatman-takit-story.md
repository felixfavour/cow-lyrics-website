I can't believe my eyes
Back in the days when I was nobody
Back in the days when there was no money
Poverty dey and it was not funny
For visiting days nobody come for me
But I thank my papa
And I than my mama
Them dey work and pray on top say e no easy brother
E be pain me gaga
Story story ooo (story, story)
Allow me to tell my story gan (story story)
Glory glory ooo (glory, glory)
Baba make You take the glory gan (glory, glory)
Na my story story ooo (story, story)
Allow me to tell my story gan (story story)
Glory glory ooo (glory, glory)
