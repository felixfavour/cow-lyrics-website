"God Is On The Throne"
(studio version)
You're able to do it, I know You can
'Cause God, You are faithful to move again
This mountain, it seems big but I know You're with me
So Jesus, I'm grateful until the very end
I can hear Your voice singin' over me
I'm free indeed
(Oh) I can feel Your power washing over me
And I'm free indeed
You are my Savior so I won't fear
'Cause I know You've got this, Your power's here
You are my breakthrough, You're makin' all things new
So I praise You forever, to You I sing
I can hear Your voice singin' over me
And I'm free indeed
Yeah, I can feel Your power washing over me
And I'm free indeed
For God is on the throne, He is in control
Reigning over all, He is powerful, so powerful
I lift His name', and I give Him praise
For He'll make a way, He is powerful, so powerful
I can hear Your voice singin' over me
And I'm free indeed
I can feel Your power washing over me
And I'm free indeed
And I'm free indeed
I'm free indeed
