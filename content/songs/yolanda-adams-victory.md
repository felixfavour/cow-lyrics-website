landa Adams : Victory
-
I've got, got the victory,
I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus. Yes I do.
He's a mighty conqueror.
In Him I will trust all my battles He'll fight.
I got the sweet, sweet victory in Jesus.
For me He died but He rose on the third day.
That's why I have true victory everyday.
Truly I've been through the storm and rain.
I know everything about heartache and pain.
But God carried me through it all.
Without His protection I'd surely fall.
I've been broke without a dime to my name.
But all my bills got paid because I called on Jesus' name.
You can't tell me that God isn't real
'cause I got the victory and that's why I'm still here.
I'm not worried about material things I don't have.
I just bless 'cause I'm sure if my Savior's care
Because I know my blessing is on the way,
I can't see it right now, but I stand by faith.
I fought many, many battles in His name.
I held up the blood-stained banner and proclaimed
that Jesus is the truth and the light.
Believe me when I say He will make it right.
Yeah I got the victory yeah
I got the victory yeah, yeah, yeah
And if you have the victory sing along with me
Sing it with me I've got the victory
I got the victory yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
o-ho-o-ho-o-ho yeah-yeeess
Say I got the victory yeeeess
I got the victory yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, hea, yes
sing along with me
