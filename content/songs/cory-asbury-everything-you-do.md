I was born inside of a rainbow...
I was raised on mercy and grace..
I was crowned with sweet loving kindness
 I was made to see ur face.
So I sing Hallelujah
I sing hallalu
I sing hallalujah
Cause I love you
..cos every thing u do, jus screams I luv you..
everything you are says I care.(2)
...(drum roll)
I was called form out of darkness
I was closed with mercy so sure
Nd I was giving beauty for ashes
And Evertin else I dnt deserve
So I sing hallelujah.,I sing hallau (2)
Cos I love you.....
Cause Evertin u do it just screams I luv u
Evertin u are says I care (2).....
oh oh oh.
And what am dat u would love like u do
and hu am dat u should care (2)
(drum roll)
Worthless men
worthless men...
worthless men.==
