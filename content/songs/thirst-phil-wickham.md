[Intro]
Hmm-mm, mm, yeah, yeah
Hmm-mm, yeah, mm
Wash over me like a tidal wave
Clean out what pulls me to the grave
Nothing left that You don't love
[Pre-Chorus]
Take me where Your river flows
Heal the desert in my soul
Let It wash over my feet
All I'm asking for is just a drink
I thirst for You
Yes, my soul it thirsts for You
Even as the deer is panting for the stream
Even though my soul is thirsty
I thirst for You
[Hook]
Oh, hmm-mm, mm
Spirit of the Living God
Would You fall afresh like rain on us (Us)
Burst the doors and flood the halls
Into forgotten rooms inside our hearts
