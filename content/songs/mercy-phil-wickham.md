Made from the dust and breathed into life
He stood unashamed with a fire in His eyes
The image of God
Walking upon the world
All of the Earth, was under His feet
Except for the fruit from a Forbidden Tree
He took a taste, and that's how He breaks the world
He cried, "Mercy
Mercy"He broke the whole world with the fruit from a tree, have mercy
Heaven to Earth, came down from on high
With hope in His name, and a fire in His eyes
The fullness of God
Walking upon the world
He said He was love, then proved it with Blood
Rose from the dead to prove He was God
And that's what it takes
For One man to save the world
