When you focus on the sun
You feel the light on your face
And your heart gets warm
Remember what He's done
And you feel from the hills
That your help will come
When you focus
On the storm though
Everything around you
Is yelling No hope
Your boat is Rocking
In the dark Waves

And it's enough to make you wanna
Jump Ship, Jump Ship
Jump Ship
Don't forget God is
On it, On it, On it
So you won't have to
Jump Ship, Jump Ship
Jump Ship
Cause you know God will
Handle it, He will Handle it
I know He will Handle it
He will Handle it
Feels like you're about to blow
Don't let the lies and replies
Take you off your post
Just breathe and let it go
Put the phone down
And know God is in control
And let the master of the seas
Keep you in perfect peace
A blessing under pressure
The pressure makes you better
And better gives you hope
For where You gotta go

So you ain't gotta
Jump Ship, Jump Ship
Jump Ship
Cause you know my God is
On it, On it, On it
So you don't have to
Jump Ship, Jump Ship
Jump Ship
Cause you know God will
Handle it, He will handle it
Handle it, He will handle it
Please Remember that
Our God can
Handle it, Handle it
Handle it, He will Handle it
Everybody Dance now
You're the one
That I trust in the war
You are my Defense
And I'll hold on to You in the storm
So I won't Jump Ship
In the darkness
You shine like the sun
Stick with You
Till I get to the Shore

So don't have to
Jump Ship, Jump Ship
Jump Ship
Don't forget God is
On it, On It, On it
Hey, you don't really have to
Jump Ship, Jump Ship
Jump Ship
Cause you know my God will
Handle it, He will handle it
Handle it, He will handle it
