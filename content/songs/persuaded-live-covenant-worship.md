Your love is so deep, Your love is so wide
It stretches so far, and reaches so high
Oh, this love You have for me
In all of my fear, in all of my doubt
Your love is enough, it never runs out
Oh, this love that makes me sing
There is nothing in the world
Nothing like Your love for me
No one captivates me like You do
There is nothing I could face
No one that could take Your place
Nothing I would trade to be with You
Just to be with You
No valley too low, no mountain too high
No place I could go, nowhere I could hide
God, Your love still reaches me
Oh, it reaches me!
There is nothing in the world
Nothing like Your love for me
No one captivates me like You do
There is nothing I could face
No one that could take Your place
Nothing I would trade to be with You
Just to be with You
