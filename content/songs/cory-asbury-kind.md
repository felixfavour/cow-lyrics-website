Sometimes marriages don't work, and sometimes babies die
Sometimes rehab turns to relapse and you're left just askin' why
And for all the prayers I've prayed, I still wonder if He's real
And if He is, how is He choosin' who He does and doesn't heal?
I've tried to run from Jesus, I've started holy wars
I've tried the patient waitin' and the kickin' down the doors
I've cursed His name in anger with my fist raised to the sky
And in return, all He's ever been is kind
And I've burned my fair share of bridges
I learned to tuck my tail and run
Watch the wreckage in the rear view
From all the crooked things I've done
And I know that He forgives me
But it's hard to forgive myself
I can't help but think that amazing grace is for everybody else
I've tried to run from Jesus, I've started holy wars
I've tried the patient waitin' and the kickin' down the doors
I've cursed His name in anger with my fist raised to the sky
And in return, all He's ever been is kind
All He's ever been is kind
And I know I wasn't there
But when I look up at the cross
I see the darkest day in history
I guess that's what kindness cost
I've tried to run from Jesus, I've started holy wars
I've tried the patient waitin' and the kickin' down the doors
He knows I don't deserve it
But He's never changed His mind
All He's ever been is kind
All He's ever been is kind
