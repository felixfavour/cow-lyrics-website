the crowded streets
All the people that I see
Want them to know the Jesus that I know
If I'm the closest thing
To a Bible that they read
Let the words they read be what you wrote
Father help me to go
I'll be a Garden in Manhattan be a
River where it's dry
When my friends can't find the road
I'll be a roadside welcome sign
Sunshine in Seattle
Be a cool breeze in July
Light in the darkness
I'll be a garden
A Garden in Manhattan
Florida after dark
I know it ain't quite Central Park
But there's souls in my hometown you wanna reach
So God use me where you have me
I'll be a Garden in Manhattan be a
River where it's dry
When my friends can't find the road
I'll be a roadside welcome sign
Sunshine in Seattle
Be a cool breeze in July
Light in the darkness
I'll be a garden
A Garden in Manhattan
A Garden in Manhattan
A flower in the concrete
If that's where you want me
Give me holy confidence
I don't care the consequence
I can't keep you all to myself
It goes against my common sense
But I refuse to run from it
I can't keep you all to myself
I'll be a Garden in Manhattan be a
River where it's dry
When my friends can't find the road
I'll be a roadside welcome sign
Sunshine in Seattle
Be a cool breeze in July
Light in the darkness
I'll be a garden
A Garden in Manhattan
A Garden in Manhattan
A flower in the concrete
If that's where you want me
