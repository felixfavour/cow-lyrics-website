I searched the world
But it couldn't fill me
Man's empty praise and treasures that fade are never enough
Then You came along
And put me back together
And every desire is now satisfied
Here in Your love
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
[Interlude]
Oh, yes, I know it's true
Come on, stand up
I'm not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws
Lord, You've seem them all
And You still call me friend
'Cause the God of the mountain
Is the God of the valley
There's not a place Your mercy and grace
Won't find me again
