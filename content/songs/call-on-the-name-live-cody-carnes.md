I've heard about Your saving grace
The gift of Your salvation
Is it true that anyone who calls upon Your name
Is welcomed in Your kingdom?
I've seen You love a wretch like me
I've seen You heal the hurting
To the restless anxious wandering heart, it's such good news
My soul can stop, it's searching
I call on the name of Jesus
I want to be saved
I never want to be the same
This life I'm leading
It's all Yours, it's all Yours
(It's all Yours)
Teach my soul to trust in You
Teach my ears to listen
With all my heart, I want to sing the prais–µ You're due
And follow in Your wisdom
