I find my strength right here
In the shadow of your way
Your presence fills my heart
Come on god in many ways
Though my heart and flesh may fail
You alone oh carry me
Way beyond the here and now
Lord for all eternity
You are heaven heaven in me
You are heaven heaven so real
Angel's army sing with me
Lifting up the highest praise
Oh Lord Jesus we arise
Lifting high your holy name
You are heaven heaven in me
You are heaven heaven so real
You are heaven heaven in me
You are heaven heaven so real
When eyes is over I run to watch you
Jesus the lover of my soul
My loving shepherd
You are my saving grace holy
I sing with angels around your throne
With all I am Hallelujah
Always forever you are my healer
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
You are heaven heaven in me
You are heaven heaven so real
You are heaven heaven in me
You are heaven heaven so real
