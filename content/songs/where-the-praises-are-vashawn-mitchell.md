[Chorus]
I want to be where the praises are
I want to be where God is
I want to be where the spirit lives
There's no place I'd rather be
Where the spirit is there is liberty
Whom the son sets free is free indeed
He inhibits the praise of you and me
There's no place I'd rather be
Where the spirit is there is liberty
Whom the son sets free is free indeed
He inhibits the praise of you and me
There's no place I'd rather be
Praise him
Lift him up
He inhibits the praises
So lift him up
Praise him
