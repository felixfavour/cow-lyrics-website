Jesus, I love You, my Saviour
Jesus, Your love it has healed me opened my heart
Jesus, I thank You for all that You've given
Jesus, I stand here amazed at forgiveness
Every time I close my eyes
Im filled with awe at all you've done
Every time I think on You
Im grateful for Your Love
Oh Lord, here I am, raise my hands
I surrender
Oh Lord, here I am at your Throne
Sweet abandon
