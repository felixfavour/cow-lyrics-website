Our God
Is an awesome God he reigns
From heaven above
With wisdom,power and love
Our God is an awesome God
You're marevelous and you're glorious
You're love has made me victorious
You took away the fear in us
Now we praise You cause you
You delivered us
There ain't no stoppin us (naw)
Devil there ain't no blockin us (naw)
Come on and clap your hands with us
Like this like that
He reigns
He reigns
He reigns
Forever and ever
