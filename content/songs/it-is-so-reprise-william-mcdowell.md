If you believe then let me hear somebody say it is so
Somebody say it is so
Come on all my caribbean nations in here
It’s for you come on put your hands together
Come on let’s say it together
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
It is so, it is so

It is so, it is so
Come on help us say it
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen

He has redeemed us - AMEN!
He will hear us - AMEN!
When we call - AMEN!
And when afflictions - AMEN!
Comes on the righteous - AMEN
He will deliver us out of them all
