Turn my eyes to You
I turn away from the things of this world
God I look to You
I run towards the prize of my heart
I know Your eyes are on me
You won't turn Your face away
Only love within Your gaze
And all my heart is on You
I will rest under Your shade
All my hope is in Your Name
Whoah-o-o-ohh
Love You, Jesus
Whoah-o-o-ohh
I lift my hands to You
Bring the purest worship l have
For I'm at home in You
I soar upon the wings of Your love
I know Your eyes are on me
You won't turn Your face away
Only love within Your gaze
And all my heart is on You
I will rest under Your shade
All my hope is in Your Name
Whoah-o-o-ohh
Whoah-o-o-ohh
As I live and, as I move
All of my hope it, is in You God
There is nothing, I can bring
Only Jesus, to You I cling
For You are risen, and I am with You
You have spoken, and I am whole
In every fiber, of my being
Will declare that, You are Lord
2x
That You are Lord, that You are Lord
That You are Lord, that You are Lord
That You are Lord, that You are Lord
That You are Lord, that You are Lord
I know Your eyes are on me
You won't turn Your face away
Only love within Your gaze
And all my heart is on You
I will rest under Your shade
All my hope is in Your Name
Whoah-o-o-ohh
Whoah-o-o-ohh
Whoah-o-o-ohh
Whoah-o-o-ohh
And as I live and, as I move
All of my hope it, is in You God
There is nothing, I can bring
Only Jesus, to You I cling
For You are risen, and I am with You
You have spoken, and I am whole
In every fiber, of my being
Will declare that, You are Lord
2x
That You are Lord, that You are Lord
That You are Lord, that You are Lord
That You are Lord, that You are Lord
You are Lord, that You are Lord
You are Lord, You are Lord
For You are Lord, You are Lord
For You are Lord, You are Lord
For You are Lord, You are Lord ...
