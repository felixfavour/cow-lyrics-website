Glory to Your name!
Everlasting One
He that dwellest in a place called The Solitary Location
So profound, we cannot locate it
We could only write it as The Secret Place
And therein in the ages past
Deities have shown up
Buddha tried
'Muhammed' attempted
There was Krishna
And there was the Bahá'í
None could qualify to have the title, Holy
It seems not to work
It seems not to sound right
There's no word that says holy Buddha
But Thou art a God that are Holy (come on)
It's Your title, it's who You are (Amen)
The Everlasting One, that sat in a place called All in One
Spoke before time began
He that constituted all things but has no (hey) constitution Himself (come on)
He that sustains all things but is not sustained by any other
You surprise the existence of time
By showing up, saying, "In the beginning, God"
