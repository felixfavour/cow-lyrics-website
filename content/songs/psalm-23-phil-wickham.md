[Intro: Tiffany Hudson]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
The Lord is my Shepherd, there's nothing I need
You lead me to the safest places, You lead me to the safest places
To walk in the meadow and lie by the stream
You meet me in the quiet places, You meet me in the quiet places
[Chorus: Phil Wickham]
Your goodness and Your mercy will follow me
All the days of my life, all the days of my life
And I'll dwell in Your house for eternity
I'll be there by Your side, I'll be there by Your side
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I don't have to fear no evil, for I know that You are with me
With oil of blessing, You cover my head
You fill me to overflowin', my cup is overflowin'
[Chorus: Phil Wickham & Tiffany Hudson]
And Your goodness and Your mercy will follow me
All the days of my life, all the days of my life
And I'll dwell in Your house for eternity
I'll be there by Your side, I'll be there by Your side
All the days of my life, all the days of my life
