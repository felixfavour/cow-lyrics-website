Man, I sure do love this time of year
Snow starts covering up the old John Deere
Old school lights hanging off my roof
Front porch mistletoe kissing booth
Cup filled up with some feel-good Christmas cheer
'Round here
We got snowflakes falling on an old true lane
Red-bow wreaths on a window pane
Just sitting 'round a fire with the ones who love me
Miles from a city and the crazy crowds
Where the pine trees grow and the world slows down
Way out here, yeah, man I sure feel lucky
Doing Christmas in the country (Do-do, do-do, do-do)
Doing Christmas in the country (Do-do, do-do, do-do)
Upright piano in the living room
Sing 'Silent Night' just a little out of tune
Christmas Vacation on the TV screen
Wise man missing from the manger scene
Kids can't sleep 'cause Santa's coming soon, yeah real soon
We got snowflakes falling on an old true lane
Red-bow wreaths on a window pane
Just sitting 'round a fire with the ones who love me
Miles from a city and the crazy crowds
Where the pine trees grow and the world slows down
Way out here, yeah, man I sure feel lucky
Doing Christmas in the country (Do-do, do-do, do-do)
Doing Christmas in the country (Do-do, do-do, do-do)
