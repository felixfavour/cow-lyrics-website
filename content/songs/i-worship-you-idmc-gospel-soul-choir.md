I worship you
I worship you
I worship you
Chorus
I worship you
Almighty God
There is none like you
I worship you
Oh Prince of peace
That is what I want to do
I give you praise
Youâ€™re my righteousness
I give my life
To you in praise
I worship you almighty god
There is none like you
Verse
In everything that I do
I wanna give you praise
Everyday that I live
I wanna praise your name
God made me a promise in his words
He said when the praises go up
Then the blessings will come down
Nothing compares to the promise I have in you
