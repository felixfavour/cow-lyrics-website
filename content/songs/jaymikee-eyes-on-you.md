eh This song has written for those whose spirits are imprisoned victims of the devil's lies that would never fit into the promises of God, listen It's because you've forgotten who you are the power God has given you to fight the war the next time you are down on the floor just remind yourself who these names are for . I'm a living testimony eh I'm a prove of a miracle eh I'm the light in the darkness the voice crying out in the wilderness eh eh I'm a temple of the most high eh I'm a chosen generation eh I'm an image of the father eh the soul that was saved from the slaughter. Dark days and stormy night, Thunders and lightnings flash the sky won't stop me from holding on because I got my eyes on you. strong winds and heavy rain black clouds and shadows all around can't stop me from holding on because I've got my eyes on you eh 'cus you're all I have eh and you're all I need eh I'm complete when I'm in you eh even though bleeding eh eh You hear my prayers and when I call you answer me you raise me up so I can hear you say just hold on... Today we christians live in fear, the fear of how much pressure our souls can bare, we say to everyone that we are standing but deep inside of our hearts we know that we're bending, That's why everyday we're raising and falling, Instead of flying high we're on the ground crawling, That's why I'm here to remind you of who you really are and your status in the universe eh I'm a living testimony eh I'm a prove of a miracle eh I'm the light in the darkness eh The voice crying out in the wilderness eh eh I'm a temple of the most high eh I'm a chosen generation eh I'm an images of the father.. The soul that was saved from the slaughter Dark days and stormy night Thunders and lightnings flash the sky won't stop me from holding on because I've got my eyes on you eh eh Strong winds and heavy rain Black clouds and shadows all around can't stop me from holding on because I've got my eyes on you eh Cus you're all I have eh and you're all I need eh I am complete when I'm in you even though I'm bleeding eh eh You hear my prayers and eh when I call you answer me eh you raise me up so I can hear you say just hold on eh So in conclusion do away with every feeling or spirit of confusion it's an illusion eh Le le let your mind be a custom to the scripture Now that's the bigger picture Begin to see yourself through God's eyes any other theory is nothing but devil's lies Let the Holy spirit take the lead cus in the Â¿ of time his all that you'll ever need eh 'cus you're all I have and you're all I need eh I'm complete when I'm in you even though I'm bleeding you hear my prayers and eh when I call you answer me eh you raise me up so I can hear you say Just hold on WHEN YOU PASS THROUGH THE WATERS IT WILL NOT OVERWHELM YOU WHEN YOU PASS THROUGH THE FIRE IT SHALL NOT BURN YOU!!
