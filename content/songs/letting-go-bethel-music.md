You’ve brought me to the end of myself
And this has been the longest road
Just when my hallelujah was tired
You gave me a new song
I’m letting go
I’m letting go
I’m letting go
Falling into You
I confess I still get scared sometimes
But perfect love comes rushing
And all the lies that screamed inside go silent
The moment You begin
I’m letting go
I’m letting go
I’m letting go
Falling into You
I’m letting go
I’m letting go
I’m letting go
Falling into You
