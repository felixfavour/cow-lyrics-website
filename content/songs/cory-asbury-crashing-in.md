I believe in a God who loves me well
Better than I can love myself
But I can't seem to make sense of grace
And I feel unworthy of Your love most days
Yet You welcome me into Your holy place
With nothing to gain, nothing to lose
Nothing to show and nothing to prove
The weight of the world falls off my shoulders
As the weight of your love, comes crashing in
Come crashing in
And I believe in a river that never runs dry
Fears washed away in the waters of life
So no more playing it safe at the river's edge
I let go and I dive right in
Trade fear for faith and I learn to swim
With nothing to gain, nothing to lose
Nothing to show and nothing to prove
The weight of the world falls off my shoulders
As the weight of your love, comes crashing in
Come crashing in
And I believe in a God who loves me well
He's teaching me how to love myself
And patiently he fathers me
'Cause growing up can be a delicate thing
And maybe being a kid is exactly where I'm supposed to be
It's right where I'm supposed to be
It's right where I'm supposed to be
Right here in your arms, God
