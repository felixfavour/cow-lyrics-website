Just a little
And a little bit more
But the truth is, oh but the truth is
I just can't get enough
Blow me a whistle
Can you fire me a gun
Oh your love is my trigger
Oh your love is truuummm...
Oya put it in practice
Give me all your emotions
Oya sole doke, oya soke dile
What you're doing isn't madness
Can I put you in my canvas
You're making me feel like an artist
Whoa! You make a sinner man
You'gon make a sinner man
But am righteous (righteous)

You want me to see direction
Oya love me 1 time 2 times ahn ahn
Till you run out of affection
Oh yeah me and you so true
Your love is so contagious
And you won't ever have to question
My love
You won't ever have to doubt it
