What am I supposed to do?
What happened to my breakthrough?
Why won't You answer my question?
I've lost my sense of direction
[Pre-Chorus]
I need You to protect me from the what-ifs
To direct me and to guide it
With the precision of a knife
To protect me from the what-ifs
To direct me and to guide it
With the precision of a knife
Precision of a knife
[Interlude]
Mm-da-mm, mm-da, mm-da, mm-da-mm
Mm-da-mm, mm-da, mm-da, mm-da-mm
I remember what You said to me
But I don't see signs of it happening
It happening
[Pre-Chorus]
I need You to protect me from the what-ifs
To direct me and to guide it
With the precision of a knife
To protect me from the what-ifs
To direct me and to guide it
With the precision of a knife
Precision of a knife
