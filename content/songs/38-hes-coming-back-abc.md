He's coming back on a sliver cloud of glory! He's gonna take me away! I'm looking now at the signs of His returning, It won't be long, it may just be today!

Jesus has gone to prepare for me a mansion Way up on Glory Avenue! I'm standing firm on the promise that He made me. That, "where I am, you may be there, too." 

He's coming back on a silver cloud of glory! He's gonna take me away! I'm looking now for the sign of His returning. It won't be long, it may just be today!

How many times have I dreamed of His appearing. When He will take His bride away? I'm making plans to attend that marriage supper. On that great eternal wedding day!

He's coming back on a silver cloud of glory! He's gonna take me away! I'm looking now for the sign of His returning. It won't be long, it may just be today!

He's coming back on a silver cloud of glory! He's gonna take me away! I'm looking now for the sign of His returning. It won't be long, it may just be today!

It won't be long, it may just be today!
