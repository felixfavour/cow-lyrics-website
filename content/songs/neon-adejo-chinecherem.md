If no be you
Tell me where I for dey today
If not grace
Wetin I for be today
Oku n'erere (Consuming fire)
You are there for me
Onye Nzoputa (My saviour)
You no dey fall my hand
See how you came
And you turned my life around
From nothing to something
Daddy you are taking me everywhere
Oku n'erere (Consuming fire)
You are there for me
Onye nzoputa (My saviour)
You know dey fall my hand
Chinecherem
(The God that thinks for me)
Odighi onye di ka gi
(There is no one else like you)
Chinecherem
Eze n'azam ekpere
(The king that answers my prayer)
Oku n'erere (Consuming fire)
You are there for me
Onye nzoputa (Saviour)
You no dey fall my hand
Onye nemema
