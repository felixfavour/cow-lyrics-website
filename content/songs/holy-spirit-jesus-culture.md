There's nothing worth more, 
that will ever come close
No thing can compare, 
You're our living hope
Your Presence, Lord
I've tasted and seen, 
of the sweetest of Loves
Where my heart becomes free, and my shame is undone
In Your Presence, Lord 

Holy Spirit You are welcome here
Come flood this place 
and fill the atmosphere
Your Glory God
is what our hearts long for
To be overcome 
by Your Presence Lord

Let us become more aware of Your presence
Let us experience the glory of Your goodness

Holy Spirit You are welcome here
Come flood this place 
and fill the atmosphere
Your Glory God
is what our hearts long for
To be overcome 
by Your Presence Lord
