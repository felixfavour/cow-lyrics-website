O holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
Truly He taught us to love one another
His law is love, and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Christ is the Lord
O praise His name forever
His power and glory evermore proclaim
Holy, Holy, are You Lord, God Almighty
Worthy is the Lamb, Worthy is the Lamb
You are Holy, Holy, are You Lord, God Almighty
Worthy is the Lamb, Worthy is the Lamb
You are Holy
