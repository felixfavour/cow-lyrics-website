I approach the throne of glory
Nothing in my hands I bring
But the promise of acceptance
From a good and gracious King
I will give to You my burden
As You give to me Your strength
Come and fill me with Your Spirit
As I sing to You this praise

You deserve the greater glory, and overcome, I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing, empty handed I rejoice
You deserve the greater glory, and overcome with joy I sing
By Your love, I am accepted, 'cause You're a good and gracious King
And O what grace that You would see me
As Your child and as Your friend
Safe, secure in You forever
I pour out my praise again

'Cause You deserve the greater glory, and overcome, I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing, empty handed I rejoice
'Cause You deserve the greater glory, and overcome with joy I sing
By Your love, I am accepted, 'cause You're a good and gracious King
I approach the throne of glory
Nothing in my hands I bring
But the promise of acceptance
From a good and gracious King
I will give to You my burden
As You give to me Your strength
Come and fill me with Your Spirit
As I sing to You this praise

You deserve the greater glory, and overcome, I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing, empty handed I rejoice
You deserve the greater glory, and overcome with joy I sing
By Your love, I am accepted, 'cause You're a good and gracious King
And O what grace that You would see me
As Your child and as Your friend
Safe, secure in You forever
I pour out my praise again

'Cause You deserve the greater glory, and overcome, I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing, empty handed I rejoice
'Cause You deserve the greater glory, and overcome with joy I sing
By Your love, I am accepted, 'cause You're a good and gracious King
I approach the throne of glory
Nothing in my hands I bring
But the promise of acceptance
From a good and gracious King
I will give to You my burden
As You give to me Your strength
Come and fill me with Your Spirit
As I sing to You this praise

You deserve the greater glory, and overcome, I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing, empty handed I rejoice
You deserve the greater glory, and overcome with joy I sing
By Your love, I am accepted, 'cause You're a good and gracious King
And O what grace that You would see me
As Your child and as Your friend
Safe, secure in You forever
I pour out my praise again

'Cause You deserve the greater glory, and overcome, I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing, empty handed I rejoice
'Cause You deserve the greater glory, and overcome with joy I sing
By Your love, I am accepted, 'cause You're a good and gracious King
