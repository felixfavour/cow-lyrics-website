Intro: Steffany Gretzinger]
We are returning
To the place we've always belonged
Righted here with You
Take me back to the garden
Lead me be back to moment I heard Your voice
Take me back to communion
Lead me back to the moment I saw Your face
[Pre-Chorus: Steffany Gretzinger]
And it was all so simple
It was easy to love
No space between us
It was easy to trust
'Cause You are closer, closer than my skin
And You are in the air I'm breathing in (Yes, You are)
And here's where the dead things come back to living
I feel my heart beating again
Feels so good to know You are my friend
And this is the garden
Here in the place I find You close
This is communion
Here in the place I'm fully known
