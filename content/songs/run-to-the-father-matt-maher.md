I've carried a burden
For too long on my own
I wasn't created
To bear it alone
I hear Your invitation
To let it all go
I see it now
I'm laying it down
And I know that I need You
I run to the Father
I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding
No reason to wait
My heart needs a surgeon
My soul needs a friend
So I'll run to the Father
Again and again and again and again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You saw my condition
Had a plan from the start
Your Son for redemption
The price for my heart
I don't have a context
For that kind of love
I don't understand
I can't comprehend
All I know is I need You
