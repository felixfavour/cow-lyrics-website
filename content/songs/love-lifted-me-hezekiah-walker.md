LEAD:
There is something I wanna say
I'm gland that Jesus came my way
Picked me up, and turned me around
Then He placed my feet on higher ground
CHORUS:
Love lifted me
Love lifted me
Love lifted me
Love lifted me
LEAD:
THere is something I wanna say
That I remember when He came my hand
With a tender hand, He lifted me
Then He turned around and gave victory
CHORUS
BRIDGE:
When nothing else could help
When nothing else could help
When nothing else could help
When nothing else could help
When nothing else could help
When nothing else could help
When nothing else could help
When nothing else could help
Love lifted (It lifted)
