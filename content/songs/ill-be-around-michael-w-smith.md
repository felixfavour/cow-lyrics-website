Hey boy - did you find out
Whatcha had to know - 'n what it's all about
When you started to move - just a step at a time
You never wanted to fall
You took a chance on the wild side
Hey, girl - can'tcha come down
Are ya way at the top - afraid of somethin' you found
Then you try to go back - not as easy to do
Did you find who you are
From a dance on the wild side
I know sometimes it's hard for you
To keep your feet upon the path that you've chosen
It's not for you to walk alone
Together we can take this road where it's going - hang on
Chorus 1:
Stand by me - stand right here
The time has come to say it clear
Now don't give up - but don't give in
We will stand together to the end
And I'll be around - I'll be around, yeah
No joke - the sooner you find
It happens all the same - for every mother's child
When you walk in the dark - then you stumble and fall
It's a part of it all
When we dance on the wild side
