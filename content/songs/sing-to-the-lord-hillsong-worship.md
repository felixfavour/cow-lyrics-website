Righteous Ruler of the heavens
Holy, holy, our God
Sovereign Lord of all creation
Holy, holy, our God
Every tribe and tongue
Lift your voice as one
He is greatly to be praised
Sing to the Lord, oh my soul
Let the heavens shout for joy
Great is our God
Great is our God
Nations come and bow before Him
Holy, holy, our God
Angels sing now and forever
Holy, holy, our God
Every tribe and tongue
Lift your voice as one
He is greatly to be praised
Sing to the Lord, oh my soul
Let the heavens shout for joy
Great is our God
Great is our God
