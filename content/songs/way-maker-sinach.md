You are here, moving in our midst
I worship You, I worship You
You are here, working in this place
I worship You, I worship You
You are here, moving in our midst
I worship You, I worship You
You are here, working in this place
I worship You, I worship You

[Chorus]
Way maker, miracle worker
Promise keeper, light in the darkness
My God, that is who You are
Way maker, miracle worker
Promise keeper, light in the darkness
My God, that is who You are

You are here, touching every heart
I worship You, I worship You
You are here, healing every heart
I worship You, I worship You
You are here, turning lives around
I worship You, I worship You
You are here, mending every heart
I worship You, I worship You

You wipe away all tears, You mend the broken heart
You're the answer to it all, Jesus
You wipe away all tears, You mend the broken heart
You’re the answer to it all, to it all, Jesus… yeah

You are here, touching every life
I worship You, I worship You
You are here, meeting every need
I worship You, I worship You
