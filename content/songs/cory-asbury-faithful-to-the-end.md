The promise of your coming light
Its burns so brightly in my mind
and all creation broken way.
before the dawning of that day

 and he will come
ridding in the clouds with justice in his heart and a sword upon his side
and all will see the glory of this man with fire in his eyes
his jealous of his pride
his faithful to the end
his faithful to my heart
his faith to the end
he will come and marry me
his faithful to the end
his faithful to my heart
his faithful to the end
he will come and marry me
