This is a good place to give God a praise
If you know you serve a God that's undefeated
The one that's sits on the throne that sits high, sits high and looks low
Open up your mouth and give God a thunderous praise
Come on and give Him a praise in the building
You reign (You reign)
You reign (You reign)
You reign (Undefeated)
Undefeated (Undefeated)
Undefeated (You reign)
You reign (Say that I know You reign)
You reign (I gotta know You reign)
You reign (You sit in a place where You have victory and authority)
Undefeated (Undefeated)
Undefeated (King of Glory)
Undefeated
