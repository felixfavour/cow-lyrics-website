They sent for Jesus, your friends about to die. But tarried He still on behind
So they laid Lazarus in a tomb. And said their last good by but coming down. The road was Jesus right on time.

Just hold on my child because He's not to far away. And He knows your need before you pray. So when your feet are weary, from the mountain. You have climbed. Look ahead here comes Jesus, Right on time.

Iâ€™ve struggled through life's deserts
They were so hot and dry. Till it seemed all hope. Was gone and I would die. And I wondered where
Was He, is He still a friend of mine then coming. Down the road was Jesus right on time.

Just hold on my child because He's not to far away. And He knows your need before you pray. So when your feet are weary, from the mountain. You have climbed. Look ahead here comes Jesus, Right on time.

So when your feet are weary from the mountain you have climbed look ahead here comes Jesus right on time
