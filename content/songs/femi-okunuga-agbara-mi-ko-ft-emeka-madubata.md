Verse 1
Nothing I have is of me
The fame the riches, all You gave
Even my life is nothing
Without Your love, without Your mercy that endures
Nothing I have is of me
The fame the riches, all You gave
Even my life is nothing
Without Your love, without Your mercy that endures
I overcame by the Power in Your Blood
I dominate by the Power in Your Name
This me you see, is the product of His Grace and Love
The Holy Ghost leads and guide me on
