All around, all around
Everywhere I look Your love is all around
All around, all around
Everywhere I look Your love is all around

Let the nations sing, let the people shout
Let Your kingdom come, pour Your Spirit out
Manifest, manifest Your love
Manifest, manifest Your love

Your love is too deep to navigate
And it's too high to climb
But still it's available
Time after time, after time, after time, after time
Your love lifted me
It's too deep to navigate
It's too high to climb
But still it's available
Time after time, after time, after time, after time
