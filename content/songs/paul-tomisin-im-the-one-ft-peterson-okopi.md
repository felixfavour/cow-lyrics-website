m the one the Lord sees
When He looks Down
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
You have bought me
Bought me with a price
You have kept me
Kept me by your words
You have sent me
Sent me with a song
Now I'm standing
Standing in your gaze
You have bought me
Bought me with a price
You have kept me
Kept me by your words
You have sent me
Sent me with a song
(Song to sing!)
Now I'm standing
Standing in your gaze
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks Down
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
When He's looking for a partner
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
If he's looking for 911
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
Ye na na oh (you can do like this)
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks Down
When He's looking for a man to send (oh oh oh)
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
When He's looking for a man to gist with
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks Down
When He's looking for a man to wipe He's tears oh oh
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks Down
I'm the beloved of the Lord
I am light
I shine bright like my father
Because light attracts light
Darkness flee
When He beholds me
He Just has to move
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
I'm the one
I'm the only one not to selfish (ohhh)
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
I'm the one the Lord sees
When He looks down
