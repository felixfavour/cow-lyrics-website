ho ho
For the Lord Himself is my portion
He lifts my head in glory
For my hand the Lord has exalted
He teaches me to prosper
I have come with stories to tell
I have come with
Testimonies
Take a look at me, you can see it
Say you can call me
Testimonies
It is my time, and it is my season
All around me
Testimonies
And because the Lord is my Shepherd
I shall never want
Everyday
Testimonies
Everywhere
Testimonies
See the word is working
And I'm so full of praise
In the morning
Testimonies
And in the evening
Testimonies
Now I tell the story
Of how I overcame
I testify
I testify
Your life is not ordinary
It's filled with signs and wonders
For the hand of the Lord is upon you
He fills your life with laughter
You have come with stories to tell
You have come with
Testimonies
When I look at you, I can see it
You are full of
Testimonies
It's your time yes, this is your season
All around you
Testimonies
And because the Lord is your shepherd
You shall never want
Everyday
Testimonies
Everywhere
Testimonies
See the word is working
And you are so full of praise
In the morning
Testimonies
And in the evening
Testimonies
Now we tell the story
Of how we overcame
Everyday
Testimonies
Everywhere
Testimonies
Glory Hallelujah
I'm so full of praise
In the morning
Testimonies
And in the evening
Testimonies
Now I tell the story
Of how I overcame
I testify
I testify
Oh oh oh
The Lord is my Shepherd
For He lifts me in his glory
To His glory I testify
Eh eh eh
For I am like the tree
Planted by the waters
I testify
My leaves are evergreen
A thousand shall fall down (by my side)
Ten thousands shall bow down (by my side)
I testify
I testify
Oh oh oh
From glory to glory (there we go)
And glory to glory (there we go)
To glory
To glory
I testify
This is my story
Testimonies
This is my story
Testimonies
See the word is working
I'm so full of praise
Everywhere
