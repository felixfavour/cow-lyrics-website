Might Get Loud  Elevation Worship | Brandon Lake Lyrics
Excuse ma for a Minute
But I got a Song to Sing
Might not be on Key
But it's from my Heart
No one else can Tell it
What the Lord has done for Me
This might take all Day
So I better start right Now

And it Might Get Loud
It Might Get Loud
Cause Heaven's coming Down,
Down, Down
And it Might Get Loud
It Might Get Loud
Cause Heaven's coming Down,
Down, Down
And it Might Get Loud
I don't have a Halo
No I'm not a Perfect Man
I'm just Glad to be a Child of God
When I think of
Where I could have been
Should've been, would've been
If you hadn't Stepped in
I got a Praise on the Inside
That can't be denied
And I gotta get it out right now

It Might Get Loud
It Might Get Loud
Heaven's coming Down,
Down, Down, It Might Get Loud
It Might Get Loud
Heaven's coming Down,
Down, Down, It Might Get Loud
(When the Saints start Praising)
It Might Get Loud
(When the Chains start Breaking)
Heaven's coming Down,
Down, Down, It Might Get Loud
(When the Saints start Praising)
It Might Get Loud
(When the Chains start Breaking)
Heaven's coming Down,
Down, Down, It Might Get Loud
[Bridge]
Why can't I Praise him
As Loud as I want
Why can't I Praise him as Loud as I want
Why can't I Praise him
As Loud as I want
Why can't I Praise him
As Loud as I want
Why can't I Praise him
As Loud as I want
Why can't I Praise him as Loud as I want
Why can't I Praise him
As Loud as I want
Why can't I Praise him
As Loud as I want

It Might Get Loud
It Might Get Loud
Heaven's coming Down,
Down, Down, It Might Get Loud
It Might Get Loud
Heaven's coming Down,
Down, Down, It Might Get Loud
[Bridge]
Why can't I Praise him
As Loud as I want
Why can't I Praise him as Loud as I want
Why can't I Praise him
As Loud as I want
Why can't I Praise him
As Loud as I want
