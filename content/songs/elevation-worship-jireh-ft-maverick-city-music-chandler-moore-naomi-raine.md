Jireh"
(feat. Chandler Moore & Naomi Raine)
I'll never be more loved
Than I am right now
Wasn't holding You up
So, there's nothing I can do
To let You down
Doesn't take a trophy
To make You proud
I'll never be more loved
Than I am right now (oh)
Going through a storm (yeah)
But I won't go down
I hear Your voice carried
In the rhythm of the wind
To call me out
You would cross an ocean
So, I wouldn't drown
You've never been closer
Than You are right now
(Let's sing it out y'all)
Jireh, You are enough
Jireh, You are enough
And I will be content
(Even in it)
In every circumstance
(You are) Jireh, (You are) You are enough
Forever enough
Always enough
More than Enough
Forever enough
Always enough
More than Enough
I don't wanna forget
How I feel right now
On the Mountain Top
I can see so clear what it's all about
Stay by my side
When the Sun goes down
Don't wanna forget
How I feel right now
(Jireh)
Jireh, (You are) You are enough
(You are) Jireh, (You are)
You are enough (So I will be)
I will be content
In every circumstance
Jireh, (He is always enough)
You are enough
Forever enough
Always enough
More than Enough
Forever enough
Always enough
More than Enough
I'm already loved
I'm already chosen
I know who I am
I know what You've Spoken
I'm already loved
More than I could imagine
And that is enough
(I'm already loved)
I'm already loved
I'm already chosen
I know who I am
I know what You've Spoken
I'm already loved (More than I could imagine)
More than I could imagine (That is enough)
And that is enough (It's enough for me I'm already loved)
I'm already loved (I'm already chosen)
I'm already chosen (I know who I am)
I know who I am (I know, I know what You've Spoken)
I know what You've Spoken (I'm already loved)
I'm already loved (More than I could even [?])
More than I could imagine (And that is enough)
And that is enough (Yes it is, Yes he knows, Yes he knows)
That is enough
That is enough
That is enough
That is enough
And that is enough
You are enough
You are enough
You are enough
So, I am enough
Jireh, You are enough
Jireh, You are enough
I will be content
In every circumstance
Jireh, You are enough
If he dresses the lilies
With beauty and splendor
How much more will he clothe you
How much more will he clothe you
If he watches over every sparrow
How much more does he Love you

If he dresses the lilies
With beauty and splendor
How much more will he clothe you
