They cry Holy, Holy, Lord
So we cry Holy, Holy, God
Around the throne of the Lord
I hear the elders say
At the feet of the King
There's a constant offering
Around the throne of the Lord
They never cease to sing
At the feet of the King
There's a common theme
They cry Holy, Holy, Lord
So we cry Holy, Holy, God
They cry Holy, Holy, Lord
So we cry Holy, Holy, God
You will receive Glory, Honor, Power
Both now and forever
...
To the only wise God
To the only wise King
