You're the God of this city
You're the King of these people
You're the Lord of this nation
You are
You're the light in this darkness
You're the hope to the hopeless
You're the peace to the restless
You are
There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God
For greater things are yet to come
And greater things are still to be done in this city
For greater things are yet to come
And greater things are still to be done here
You're the God of this city
You're the King of these people
You're the Lord of this nation
You are
You're the light in the darkness
You're the hope to the hopeless
You're the peace to the restless
You are
And there is no one like our God
There is no one like our God
For greater things are yet to come
And greater things have still to be done in this city
For greater things have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done in this city
For greater things have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done in this city
For greater things have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done here
Still to be done here
Help this city
Yeah yeah
There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God
