From today to the end of days
I promise to be there whenever you call my name
I'll be right by your side o, every step, I'll hold your hand
Even through the storms and all the trials of life
January to December, year after year
I'll shower you with love, pamper you with care
Nothing will ever come between us o, my dear, eh
With Olùwà at the center of our affairs
'Cause this love o, this love that I'm feeling
Nothing in this world go fit stop or conceal it
I wan dey show you off to the world every season
Celebrate our love every single day
They say no one is an island, no one's the best o
Nobody fit get everything all to himself o
Nobody can have it all, say nobody perfect o
But my baby, you are perfect for me (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh)
Beauty inside out, my baby, you complete (ah-ah-ah)
My number one, nobody dey compete (ah-ah-ah)
When I look at you, I see my dreams come true
You be my dream come true, baby
I'm so glad o (so glad o)
I'm so elated o (e-le-le-le)
And no words could tell the way I dey feel
Deep in my heart o (my heart), I'm glad I waited o
Now I get to spend forever with you
