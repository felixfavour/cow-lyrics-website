I have made You too small in my eyes
O Lord, forgive me
I have believed in a lie
That You were unable to help me
But now, O Lord, I see my wrong

Heal my heart and show Yourself strong
And in my eyes and with my song
O Lord, be magnified
O Lord, be magnified

Be magnified, O Lord 
You are highly exalted
And there is nothing You can't do
O Lord, my eyes are on You
Be magnified
O Lord , be magnified

O Lord, be magnified
