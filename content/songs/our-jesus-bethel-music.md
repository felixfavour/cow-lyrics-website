The Son of God
The heart of Heaven
Given to us
Mm, hallelujah
And oh, how gracious is the God who came to us
How wonderful and righteous is His love
Our Jesus
And oh, through the suffering and the hatred of the cross
He gathered every hope we thought was lost
Our Jesus
We are in awe
Of what love has done
You delivered us
Oh, hallelujah
Oh, hallelujah
And oh, how gracious is the God who came to us
How wonderful and righteous is His love
Our Jesus
And oh, through the suffering and the hatred of the cross
He gathered every hope we thought was lost
Our Jesus
Our Jesus
