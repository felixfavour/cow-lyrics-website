I'm alive
Cause Jesus gave me life
He opened up my eyes
And I can see clearly now
Oh oh
Everybody dance now
Oh oh oh oh
Everybody
Give it up to Jesus
Give Him glory
For He has redeemed us
Everybody
Give it up to Jesus
Praise His name
My desire
Is to lift you higher
It's only burning brighter
This passion inside of me
Everybody
Give it up to Jesus
Give Him glory
For He has redeemed us
Everybody
Give it up to Jesus
Praise Him name
Everybody
Give it up to Jesus
Give Him glory
For He has redeemed us
Everybody
Give it up to Jesus
Praise Him name
This praise is bursting out
And I can't contain it now
This praise is bursting out
Out, out
Everybody
Give it up to Jesus
Give Him glory
For He has redeemed us
Everybody
Give it up to Jesus
Praise Him name
Everybody
Give it up to Jesus
Give Him glory
For He has redeemed us
Everybody
Give it up to Jesus
Praise Him name
