I'm gonna sing
Till my heart starts changing
Oh I'm gonna worship
Till I mean every word
'Cause the way I feel
And the fear I'm facing
Doesn't change who You are
Or what You deserve
I give You my worship
You still deserve it
You're worthy
You're worthy
You're worthy of my song
I'll pour out Your praises
In blessing and breaking
You're worthy
You're worthy
You're worthy of my song
Yes You are
Yes You are Jesus
You're worthy
I'm gonna live
Like my King is risen
Gonna preach to my soul
That You've already won
And even though I can't see it
I'm gonna keep believing
That every promise You've made
Is as good as done
