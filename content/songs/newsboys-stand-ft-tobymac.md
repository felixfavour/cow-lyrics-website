Who will I be
when trouble comes calling for me
well I live the way I believe
when I'm backed up against the wall
what kind of heart do I have
and by chance
does it beat for my Saviour
or just for my flesh?
what will I do in the moment that everything falls
Chorus:
I'm gonna stand
in a world that's breaking - stand
for a truth unchanging
I'm not ashamed I've considered the cost
I'll stay right here at the foot of the cross
and stand
They can call me a fool
Stubborn for following You
For trusting without any proof
But I've seen You here through it all
So what kind of person
do I wanna be
i'm I committed to You
or committed to me
what will I choose
the second that everything falls
Chorus:
I'm gonna stand
In a world that's breaking - stand
For a truth unchanging
I'm not ashamed i've considered the cost
I'll stay right here at the foot of the cross
and stand - stand
uuuuhhh uuuhh uuh uuhh - stand -stand
uuuuhhh uuuhh uuh uuhh
I'm not ashamed i've considered the cost
I'll stay right here at the foot of the cross
and
stand up
for the one who gave everything
stand up
because You deserve all of me
not gonna give up
I'm not gonna give in - No
ouh
if it takes all I am
I'm gonna stand
in a world that's breaking
stand (I'll stand)
for a truth unchanging
I'm not ashamed i've considered the cost
I'll stay right here at the foot of the cross
and stand
(I'm gonna stand,gonna stand)
uuuuhhh uuuhh uuh uuhh(Jesus got me) - stand
gonna stand,gonna stand
uuuuhhh uuuhh uuh uuhh
I'm not ashamed i've considered the cost
I'll stay right here at the foot of the cross
and stand
