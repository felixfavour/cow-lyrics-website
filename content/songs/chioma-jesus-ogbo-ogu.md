ur going to.war with me, for he that is in me is greater than he that is in the world. I shall abide under the shadow of the almighty, if the lizard leaves the tree he will.be caught, touch not my anointed and do my prophet no harm. I shall travel in peace come back in peace. do no touch the tail of a lion wether dead or alive. I am made in the image of God.
