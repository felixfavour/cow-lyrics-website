May your kingdom come
Your will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
For yours is the kingdom
The power and glory
Forever you reign, forever you reign
[Pre-Chorus:]
Let hope swell in our lives
And we will be the Church
To live out your heart
Oh God arise up in us
We'll show the world how you love
Jesus, take our heart and make it yours
Salvation reign over us
The fight was won on the cross
We take heart, for you have overcome the world

[Pre-Chorus]


Raise your hopeful voices
Make a joyful noise and
Sing unto the King of Glory
