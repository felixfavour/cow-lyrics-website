Oh yeahâ€¦
Whisper my name, I want to hear You
Whisper my name, I want to know You
For Your sweet breath, I need to listen
Speak to me now, whisper my name, oh Lord
Whisper my name, I want to hear You
Whisper my name, I want to know You
For Your sweet breath, I need to listen
Speak to me now, whisper my name, oh Lord
Humble we stay in Your presence
So happy to stay close by Your throne
Walking each day in the glow of Your mercy
So happy to gaze upon Your face forevermore
Whisper my name, I want to hear You
Whisper my name, I want to know You
For Your sweet breath, I need to listen
Speak to me now, whisper my name, oh Lord
Humble we stay in Your presence
So happy to stay close by Your throne
Walking each day in the glow of Your mercy
So happy to gaze upon Your face forevermore
