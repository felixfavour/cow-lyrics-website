The battle line is drawn, it's all in black and white
Hope is going forward and fear from behind, it's time
It's time to make a move, so what will you decide?
The clock is ticking on, don't let it pass you by, it's time
It's time
The time is now for lifting souls
The time is now for letting go
From your skin to your core
Let light and love come rushing through the door, oh, oh
Oh, come rushing through the door
You've learned every song, memorized the verse
Took the bread and wine and even bought the shirt, it's time
It's time to hold your shield, it's time to draw your sword
Let's be the resistance so, oh, Lord, oh, Lord, oh, Lord, it's time
Yeah, it's time
The time is now for lifting souls
The time is now for letting go
From your skin to your core
Let light and love come rushing through the door
It's time to make a stand
So put your heart in greater hands
From your skin to your core
Let light and love come rushing through the door
