There is a place
That I love to dwell
It's the presence of my Father
All the host of heaven gather
Worshiping, bowing down before Him
There is a place (there is a place)
That I love to dwell (that I love to dwell)
It's the presence of my Father
All the host of heaven gather
Worshiping, bowing down before Him
I know a place (I know a place)
