Worthy is the lamb, that was slain
to receive glory and honor and praise /2x
and unto the lamb who sits upon the throne
to him be glory and honor and power for ever and ever/2x Amen
The angels bow down in adoration we join them now as we lift our voice, we cry worthy, worthy is the lamb/8x
worthy is the lamb, worthy is the lamb/2x Amen
The angels bow down in adoration we join them now as we lift our voice, we cry worthy, worthy is the lamb/4x Amen
