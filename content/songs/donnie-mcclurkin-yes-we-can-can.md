Eeeh yeah yeah yeah
Oooh  (Hmmm)
Can you tell the world about it
Can you sing your song
Can you tell the world about it
Can you sing your song
Now's the time for all good men to get together with one another
We've got to iron out our problems and iron out our quarrels
And try to live as brothers  (We've got to try)
We've got to try to find peace within without stepping on one another
And do respect the women of the world, remember we all have mothers
You gotta make this land a better land in the world in which we live
We gotta help each man and each woman be better by the kindness that we give
Well... I know we can make it. (Yes, we can)
I know real well  (We can make it, yes we can)
Yes we can, I know we can, can... Yes we can, can and why can't and if we wanna, Yes we can, can
I know we can make it work
I know we can make it if we try  (Yes we can, I know we can, can... Yes we can)
Great God Almighty  (Yes we can, I know we can, can)
(We can make it work... I know we can)
We've got to take care of the children, the children of this world
For they are the strongest hope for the world... the little bitty boys and girls
Oooh... You gotta make this land a better land in the world in which we live
We gotta help each man be a better man by the kindness that we give
Well... I know we can make it  (Oh yes, we can)
I know real well  (We can make it, yes we can)
Yes we can, I know we can, can... Yes we can, can and why can't and if we wanna, Yes we can, can
I know we can make it  (Oh yes, we can)
I know real well  (We can make it, yes we can)
Yes we can, I know we can, can... Yes we can, can and why can't and if we wanna, Yes we can, can
I know we can make it   (We can, can... oooh, can)
I know we can make it   (We can, can... oooh, can)
I know we can make it   (We can, can... we  can)
I know we can make it   (We can, can... oooh, can)
I know we can make it   (We can, can... oooh, can)
I know we can make it   (We can, can... oooh, can)
I know we can make it   (We can, can... oooh, can)
I know we can make it   (We can, can... oooh, can)
