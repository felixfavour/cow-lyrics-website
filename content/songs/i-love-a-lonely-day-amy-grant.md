TV's off at 1 AM
One more day alone again
The work gets longer every day
Why'd I have to get away?
But I have found a comfort here
Solitude can be so dear
Loneliness is not so blue
When it puts my mind on You
I love a lonely day
(I love a lonely day)
It makes me think of You
(I love a lonely day)
All alone, I can easily find Your love
I love, I love a lonely day
(I love a lonely day)
It chases me to You
(I love a lonely day)
It clears my heart
Lets my very best part shine through
It's You
Lonely people everywhere
Lucky, lonely, ones who care
You've got all you need and more
Someone to be lonely for
Someone cries for you to hear
Take your heart and wipe that tear
Give them someone they can miss
Give them love and sing them this
