Somebody scream!!!
This is a simple song, it's says "Everything is working together, for my good"  if you're excited about that, let me see you move your body
This Year, Everything is working out for my good
And I know it, I can feel it
This Year, Everything is working out for my good
It's working, It's working out for my good
Step on the enemy 3x
Oh.. For every sickness, Step on the enemy, you better step on the enemy
Step on the enemy 6x
You have tried, You have struggled
And you feel like giving up
But this year (you say) I see increase all around
You're working.. (working)
Your business (working)
Your mind (working)
Your health (working)
This year
Doors of Favour are opening unto You
Just step in, Is working out for your good
This Year
Everything is working out for my good
And I know it, I can feel it
This Year, Everything is working out for my good
It's working, It's working out for my good
This Year, Everything is working out for my good
 (This is your year of Testimony) And I know it, I can feel it
(This is your year of mighty open doors) This Year, Everything is working out for my good
It's working, It's working out for my good
This Year, Everything is working out for my good
(You go carry your own baby o) And I know it, I can feel it
(You go start your own business o) This Year, Everything is working out for my good
It's working, It's working out for my good
I'm no more where I use to be, Behind me
I'm long gone, Behind me
Poverty, Behind me
Sickness, Behind me
Behind me, Behind me
The word is working, It's working out for my good
Overtaking is allowed o, Behind me
Behind me, Behind me,
Sickness, Behind me,
Behind me, Behind me
The word is working, It's working out for my good
Overtaking is allowed o, Behind me
Behind me, Behind me,
Delay is behind me
Behind me, Behind me, Behind me
The word is working, It's working out for my good
Overtaking is allowed o, Behind me
Behind me, Behind me, Behind me, Behind me
Stagnation, Behind me, Behind me
The word is working, It's working out for my good
Overtaking is allowed o

Somebody wave like this.. wave it, wave it

God is working (working)
You're mine (healer)
Working, working, It is

Wave your hands like this, just keep waving...
If you know and you know that your mind is working, that all things worketh together for good, lift your voice and say
