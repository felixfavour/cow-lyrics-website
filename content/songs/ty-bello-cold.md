Awake sleeping soldier
for the sake of the children
for the sake of the nation
awake 2x
Give us hearts of flesh oh God
give a burden for men oh God
give us hearts of flesh oh God
a true burden for men oh God.
Have mercy Lord we are cold
we've turned away from our brothers
we've turned away from our sisters
oh oh oh
we are cold 2x
Have mercy Lord we cold
we've turned away from the crying
we've turned away from the dying
oh oh oh
we are cold 2x
so we run run run after money
we run run run after power
we run run run after money
we run run run
have mercy Lord we are cold
we've turned away from our brothers
we've turned away from our sisters
oh oh oh
we are cold 2x
have mercy Lord we are cold
we've turned away from the crying
we've turned away from the dying
we are cold
heal our cold hearts
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
we run run run after your guiding truth
we do your will oh God
oh oh oh
we run run run after you
we do what you say oh God
give us hearts of flesh oh God
a true burden for men oh God
give us hearts of flesh oh God
a true burden for men oh God.
