You gave me time when no one gave me time of day
You looked deep inside when the rest of the world looked away
You smiled at me when there were just frowns everywhere
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer
That's why I call You Saviour
That's why I call You Friend
You touched my heart
You touched my soul
And helped me start all over again
That's why I love You, Jesus
That's why I'll always care
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer
You gave me laughter after I cried all my tears
You heard my dreams while the rest of the world closed it's ears
I looked in Your eyes, and I found tenderness there
You gave me love when nobody gave me a prayer
(Chorus)
