The war is over, turn around
Lay your weapons on the ground
The smoke is fading, before the light
The dead are coming back to life
He has made a way for us
Born for glory out of dust
Children held within the arms of peace
He has made a way for all
Mercy waits where sinners fall
He is our victory
The war is over, His love has come
To call us daughters and sons
No longer orphans, without a home
Now we have found where we belong
He has made a way for us
Born for glory out of dust
Children held within the arms of peace
He has made a way for all
Mercy waits where sinners fall
He is our victory
He has made a way for us
Born for glory out of dust
Children held within the arms of peace
He has made a way for all
Mercy waits where sinners fall
He is our victory
