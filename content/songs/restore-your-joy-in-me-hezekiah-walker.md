Create in me
A clean heart O God
Renew a right spirit
Within me
Forgive me of all
Of my transgressions
Restore Your joy in me
Restore Your joy in me
(Create in me)
Create in me
(A clean heart)
A clean heart O God
(And renew)
Renew a right spirit
(Oh oh)
Within me
(Forgive me)
Forgive me of all
Of my transgressions
(Restore)
Restore Your joy in me
(Hey hey, restore your joy)
Restore Your joy in me
I know I did wrong when I strayed away from home
My problems were so much
I tried to handle them on my own
But here I am, I need a change inside
I'm asking You Lord to trust me one more time
