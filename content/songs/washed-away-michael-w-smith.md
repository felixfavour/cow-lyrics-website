Guilty, I'm guilty
It was all that I could say
Mercy, Your mercy
Crashed in like the waves
And all my sin was washed away, washed away
You took them all, there's not a trace
I stand here free, with every stain
Forever washed away
Spotless, spotless
Whiter than the snow
Your blood, Your blood
Covers me, I'm whole
And all my sin was washed away, washed away
You took them all, there's not a trace
I stand here free, with every stain
Forever washed away
And all my sin was washed away, washed away
You took them all, there's not a trace
I stand here free, with every stain
Forever washed away
