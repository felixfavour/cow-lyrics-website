Long Ago In Days Of Old, Stood A Man Of God We’re Told, As He Talked To Elijah That Day; His Request He Did Repeat, Standing At Elijah’s Feet,
“A Double Portion” I Can Hear Him Say.

Give Me, Lord, A Double Portion, Pour Thy Spirit On Me, Thru Eyes Of Faith Thy Wondrous Works I Can See,
But I Need Thy Helping Hand, In This Troubled, Sinful Land. Give Me, Lord, A Double Portion From Thee.

As Elijah Stood That Day, To Elisha He Did Say, “Ask Me What I Shall Do Unto Thee,”\ And Elisha Then Replied, Walking At Elijah’s Side, “A Double Portion, Let It Fall On Me.”

Give Me, Lord, A Double Portion, Pour Thy Spirit On Me, Thru Eyes Of Faith Thy Wondrous Works I Can See,
But I Need Thy Helping Hand, In This Troubled, Sinful Land. Give Me, Lord, A Double Portion From Thee.

Double portion Lord, I Always To Thee, Pray, Just For Strength From Day To Day, But I See There’s So Much To Be Done, That I Have To Kneel Anew And This Favor Ask Of You, A Double Portion — This Fight Must Be Won.

Give Me, Lord, A Double Portion, Pour Thy Spirit On Me, Thru Eyes Of Faith Thy Wondrous Works I Can See,
But I Need Thy Helping Hand, In This Troubled, Sinful Land. Give Me, Lord, A Double Portion From Thee.
