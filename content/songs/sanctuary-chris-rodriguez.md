Seems I left the innocence of Eden long ago
Tempted by my heart to go it on my own
Beyond the garden, somehow through the desert
Of my wanderings alone, You have never let me go
I turn from You and still You cover me
I fall so far, You find me in the deep
Anywhere I am, anywhere I am
You sanctuary me
I have felt the separation deep within my bones
Brought me to my knees, crying out for hope
Beyond the garden, somehow through my tears
You heard the words I could not speak, You were there to rescue me
I turn from You and still You cover me
I fall so far, You find me in the deep
I lose my way, You're reaching out to me
Anywhere I am, anywhere I am, You sanctuary me
I turn from You and still You cover me
I fall so far, You find me in the deep
I lose my way, You're reaching out to me
Anywhere I am, anywhere I am, You sanctuary me
