Precious compassion that pours
From the wounds that have won our salvation
Sin was strong, but the Savior is stronger
Come let us worship Him
Great was the debt that we owed
And how high was the price of our healing
Paid in full by the One who is worthy
Come let us worship Him
Raised to life with Christ the Savior
In His name a new creation
Now our song will rise
Adoring Christ the Lord
Death overcome by the Word
That was spoken before it was finished
Jesus saves is our song everlasting
Come let us worship Him
Raised to life with Christ the Savior
In His name a new creation
Now our song will rise
Adoring Christ the Lord
