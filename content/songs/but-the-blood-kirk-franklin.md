Born alone and left to dye
Rejected, often criticized
Hid behind the childhood lies
Everything has changed since the Blood
Since the Blood
Since the Blood
Oh, the Blood
Born alone and left to dye
Rejected, often criticized
Hid behind the childhood lies
Everything has changed since the Blood
(Falling on us)
Since the Blood (Gave me purpose)
Since the Blood (It says you're for us)
Since the Blood (who can be against us)
Hopeless fallen from the air
Reaching but no one is there
Screaming, quiet, no one cares
I might as well have died
But the Blood (Falling on us)
But the Blood (Gave me purpose)
But the Blood (it says you're for us)
Oh, the Blood (who can be against us)
