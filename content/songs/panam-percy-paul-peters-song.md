huhu eh eh Lord
I saw you there at the bank of the river
Telling the people about love
What though?
when u looked at my face,I was gripped with the fear seeing the light in your eyes
I remember when the people were talking
saying who you maybe,what tho'
some say the prophet some say this the devil
But you're the son of God
Chorus:Loving you is the best thing to me
brought the change in my life,what tho'
Loving you lord is the difference I see brought the change in my life
Jesus is the Lord, He's the light He's the king of my life 2ce
I remember when we went to the mountain
 Just to watch and pray,what tho'
Truly I was amazed when I saw you in glory
my eyes could not behold
And then I made a vow I must die with you Jesus
I was truly sincere what tho'
But you said I'll deny ever walking with you Lord
I knew your words must be true
Chorus
instrumental
Chorus
Ooooh uhuhuooo huuu yes Lord
Response (I love you)
loving you is the difference in my life
I don't care what the people might say
I don't care what the people might think
oh I ,I love you I love you I love you Lord
All I know that is I love you I love you I love you oh Lord and yes I know that
And I don't care what the people might think
I don't care what the people might say
when I have food,and when I don't have I'll wait oh Lord,all that I know is that I love you I love you and  I love you
