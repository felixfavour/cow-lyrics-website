Open my eyes to see
The wonderful mystery of love
Forming into You
I'm drawn to the gravity of love
Yeah, of love
[Pre-Chorus]
We're standing still
In a moment of eternity
Where worlds collide
And I feel the breath of heaven over me
My soul sings, my soul sings
My soul sings, how I love You
My soul sings, my soul sings
My soul sings, how I love You
Open the page and see
The wonderful history of love
I start and end with You
I'm pulled by the gravity of love
Yeah, of love
