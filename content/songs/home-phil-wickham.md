Come riding on a rushing wind
Blow through our hair and touch our skin
I wanna feel You now like I felt You then
Strip away my calloused heart
Set Your arrow at Your mark
[Pre-Chorus]
Can You take me back to where all started
Can You take me back to where You are
Father, I'm running, Father, I'm coming home
'Cause I cannot go on, Your child is running
Father, I'm coming home back where I belong
I know You've heard this all before
When I'm down and crying on the floor
Singing, "I want You and nothing more"But I'm breaking in my heart tonight
I've tried to stand, I've tried to fight
[Pre-Chorus]
But I cannot see without Your light
No, I cannot breathe without You
