Amazing love
Now what else shall I need
Your name brings life
It's more than the air I breathe
My world was changed
When Your life You gave for me
My purpose found
And all that You want for me
[Pre-Chorus]
And I've found myself in You
And I've found myself in You
[Pre-Chorus] [2x]
And I've found myself in You
And I've found myself in You
[Chorus] [2x]
Take me to a place
Where I can see You face to face
And all I wanna do all I wanna do
Is worship You
