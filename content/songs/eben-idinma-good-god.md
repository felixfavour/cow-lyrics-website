Thank you Jesus
You're the author of knowledge,
The beginning and the end.
Mighty strong tower
Where the righteous are save
I cannot be shaken when am under your wings.
I can never be tired of proclaiming your name.
You're the author of knowledge
The beginning and the end.
The power at work in me nIdinma
