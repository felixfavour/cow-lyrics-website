You hold the future in Your hands
You know my dreams and You have a plan
And as You light my way I'll follow You
[Pre-Chorus]
My eyes on all of the above
My soul secure in all You've done
My mind's made up and You are
The only one for me
Jesus Savior in my life You are everything
My future decided I will praise Your Name
And I know that I am I am Yours
Yeah I know that I am I am Yours
With all the earth in Your command
You are the rock on which I stand
And as I live each day I'll follow You
[Pre-Chorus]
My eyes on all of the above
My soul secure in all You've done
My mind's made up and You are
The only one for me
