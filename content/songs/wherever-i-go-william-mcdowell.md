(Chorus:)
My heart is yours
Lord I belong to you
I would do anything
Just to be close to you
Your love is so amazing
Can't keep it to myself
I gotta tell the world
I belong to you
(Bridge 1:)
Lord I'm amazed
By your great grace
That's why I can't keep it to myself
I gotta tell it whever I go
(Bridge 2:)
You are my healer
Your my provider
That's why I can't keep it to myself
I gotta tell it whever I go
(Bridge 3:)
Gives me direction
Your my protection
That's why I can't keep it to myself
I gotta tell it whever I go
