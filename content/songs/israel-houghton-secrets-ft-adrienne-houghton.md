We lie to our lovers
We lie to our friends
Painting our pictures
And playing pretend
We keep our secrets
All to ourselves
Stand a distance so no one can tell
And nobody knows us and nobody will
We all keep pretending we're better but still
We keep our secrets to cover our shame
You see the darkness and you love us the same
We run from our troubles
We run from our pain
Gather the dirt up and sweep it away
We put our mask on, pretending by faith
And carry our secrets with us to the grave
And nobody knows us and nobody will
We all keep pretending, we're better but still
We keep our secrets to cover our shame
But you see the darkness and you love us the same
Yeah, yeah
We hide our weakness, we hide our sins
We feel the guilt but keep it away
We are just children, small and afraid
Your truth will unmask us and love us the same
And nobody knows us and nobody will
All keep pretending we're better but still
We keep our secrets to cover our shame
You see the darkness and you love us the same
You see the darkness and love us the same
You'll see the darkness and you love us the same
