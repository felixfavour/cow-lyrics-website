In the passion your heart is abused
He is pushing you, you have to choose
Oh, Rebecca, love is never
Easy anymore
Oh, Rebecca, so afraid of
Losing what is yours
(CHORUS)
Are you giving in to the pressure
Holding you again, now he tells you
What it takes to be in love
He believes you're old enough
But how you gonna feel tomorrow
When the day reveals
What you believed was for the sake of love
Don't you think you're old enough to know
You're a breed of few and far between
Holding on to your romantic dream
Oh, Rebecca, love is patient
Love would understand
Oh, Rebecca, your decision
Is your only chance
(REPEAT CHORUS)
