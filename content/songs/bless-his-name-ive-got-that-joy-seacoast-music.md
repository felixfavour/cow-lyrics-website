No hesitation, no second guessing, I'm running in
Like a child in His presence
Faith-filled and fearless, I'm confident
I've got that Jo-ooo-ooo-y
Bless the Lord oh my soul
Let all that is within me, all that is within me
Bless the Lord oh my soul
Let all that is within me, all that is within me
Bless His name
Somebody bless His name
I've gotta bless His name
(come On)
You'll bring Your glory
You'll bring Your goodness
I'll bring belief
When the praises are rising
Heavens colliding with what I bring
Cause I got that
I've got that Jo-ooo-ooo-y
I've got that Jo-ooo-ooo-y
