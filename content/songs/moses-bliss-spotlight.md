Hallelujah
I'm like a city set on a hill
I cannot be hidden
This is my season
I am like a city set on a hill
I cannot be hidden
This is my season*2
I am on fire fire for Jesus
Come watch me burn
As I light up my world
The spotlight of heaven is on me
The spotlight of heaven is on me
The longer I live
The brighter I shine
When I see mountains move
Miracles happen
Chains are broken
Signs and wonder everywhere
When I show up
I am on fire ,for Jesus ,for Jesus
I am not ashamed of the gospel
I am burning for Jesus
I will show forth his glory
Show forth his grace
Show forth his power
Till the whole world knows
