[Intro]
What's His name?
Jesus
Our redemption
Our salvation
Is in His blood
Jesus
Light of Heaven
Friend forever
His kingdom come
[Spoken]
Before we leave this place
I mean, we only got this for one night
We might as well make the most of it, you know what I'm saying?
We gotta dance, we just gotta let go
I don't know, maybe it's been a while since you
Let yourself go and just danced a little
But I feel like we gotta get going
Just something, even if it's just a shoulder, a lеg
Come here, brothеr, come on, come on
You got joy written all over your face
So I need you to get up here
Here's the deal, you just do whatever you wanna do
You can't do any Fortnite moves or anything like that
No Fortnite moves 'cause I can't do any of that
It's too difficult
But you dance, man, however that God wants to lead you
And everybody here, from the top, all the way around
We're just gonna do our best to do what you do, so come on
Two, three, four
