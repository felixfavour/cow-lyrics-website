Hands up, hearts open, wide as the sky
We lift You high, we lift You high

Hands up, hearts open, wide as we cry
God, we lift Your name high

Hands up, hearts open, wide as the sky
We lift You high, we lift You high

Hands up, hearts open, wide as we cry
God, we lift Your name high

Let all the other names fade away
Let all the other names fade away
Until there's only You

Let all the other names fade away
Jesus, take Your place
Jesus, take Your place

Let all the other names fade away
Let all the other names fade away
Until there's only You

Let all the other names fade away
Jesus, take Your place
Jesus, take Your place

Jesus, take your place 
(Repeat) 

We lift You high, we lift You high (Repeat)
