When I walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
Thy rod and Thy staff
They comfort me all of my days
And all my lonely nights
Surely goodness and Your mercy
Will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house
I will dwell in the house
I will dwell
In the house of the Lord forever
Forever and ever
And ever
And ever
And ever
And ever
Shadows lurk over my shoulder
Looking to ensnare
I won't ever have to worry
Because I'm in Your care
When I feel I've been deserted
And no one is around
I won't ever feel forgotten
Because in You I'm found
