I need to know you're okay
And everything's alright
I need to know where we stand
I need to know tonight
You can see the way
The Lord has made our hearts
Into a tapestry of love
That's never torn apart
It's funny how things can change
Though I know you're always here
Rough times often come
It makes the good times, oh, so dear
Let me reassure you
My love, I'll never go
I'm trying hard to tell you
That I need to know
I need to know you're okay
And everything's alright
(I need to know, I need to know)
I need to know where we stand
I need to know tonight
Dawn is always sweeter
When the night timеs seems so dark
I need to hear your voice again
It's music to my heart, hеart, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's music to my heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
