Ten toes down, yeah I ain't going back
Ten toes down, yeah shorty in the back
Did this on my own, I been busting my back
Did this on my own, yeah hold up bring it back
Did this on my own, no cap, right?
Bust it at your cap like:
"Send him to the grave"Like I caught him at a red light
Leaving at a green light
Going through the midnight
Hold up let me get right
Thoughts at a red light
Hold up let me get right
Thoughts at a red light
Hold up play it back
Ridinâ€™ through the midnight
Ten toes down, yeah I ain't going back
Ten toes down, yeah shorty in the back
Did this on my own, I been busting my back
Did this on my own, yeah hold up bring it back
