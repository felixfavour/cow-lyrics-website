[Instrumental]
In the crushing, in the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I, now surrender
You are breaking new ground
[Pre-Chorus]
So I yield to You and to Your careful hand
When I trust You, I don't need to understand
Make me Your vessel, make me an offering
Make me whatever You want me to be
I came here with nothing but all You have given me
Jesus, bring new wine out of me
In the crushing, in the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I, now surrender
You are breaking new ground
You are breaking new ground
Make me Your vessel, make me an offering
Make me whatever You want me to be
I came here with nothing but all You have given me
Jesus, bring new wine out of me
Jesus, bring new wine out of me
Jesus, bring new wine out of me
