[Intro]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
My faith is stronger than
It's ever been before
And now and forever
Keep my eyes
Keep my eyes on you
You hold the world in the
Palm of your hand
And you know my ending
You know my ending way
Before i begin
So no matter what comes my way
I will never lose my way
I will keep holding on
To you.
And nothing can separate us
[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
