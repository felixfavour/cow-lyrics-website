The wonderful grace of Jesus
Greater than all my sins
How can a song describe Him?
Where shall my praise begin?
Taken away my burdens
Setting my spirit free
The wonderful grace of Jesus
Always reaches me
Oh yes it does
The wonderful grace of Jesus
Greater than all my sins
How can a song describe Him?
Where shall my praise begin?
Taken away my burdens
Setting my spirit free
The wonderful grace of Jesus
It always reaches me
It always reaches
[Chorus: Tasha Cobbs Leonard]
It's beautiful, wonderful, powerful
Oh the grace that found me
It's beautiful, wonderful, powerful
Yes it was Your grace that found me
