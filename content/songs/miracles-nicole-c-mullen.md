I, I, I, I believe in miracles
I, I, I, I believe in miracles
I have seen it in the earth
Watched a sunrise at its birth
Felt the sunlight washing over me
I'm convinced I heard God smile
In the laughter of a child
A lovely kind of mystery
You cannot ignore, gotta read the signs
See a crooked man walk a blessed mile
Gotta see the blind with the open eyes
These things happen in our time
Body filled with pain, body filled with griеf
Body find the Lord, body find relief
It's onе more glimpse of
The eternal in the practical
I believe in miracles
I believe in miracles
Where the Father leads me there, I'll go
Yeah, where He leads me, I will go
It's because the love you show
He changed my life and now I know
I believe in miracles
