Ooooh, so the song says
Mountains are still being moved
Strongholds are still being loosed
God we believe, cos yes we can see that
Wonders are still what You do
I love this when y'all assist
Bodies are still being raised
Giants are still being slain
God we believe, cos yes we can see that
Wonders are still what You do.
We are here for You, come and do what You do
We are here for You, come and do what You do
We set our hearts on You, come and do what You do
Cause we need a move
We need a move
Can you shout that out, we need a move,
We need a move yeah
We need a move
And bodies are still being raised
Giants are still being slain oh
God we believe, cos yes we can see that
Wonders are still what You do.
We are here for You
We are here for you, come and do what You do
We are here for You, come and do what You do
You're the only one that matters
