"He Is The Reason"
Who is this King of Israel
Born in a manger
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
He came to set us free
God's only Son is He
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
God rest ye merry Gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas day
To save us all from Satan's pow'r
When we were gone astray
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh tidings of comfort and joy
He is the reason for the celebration
Go tell ev'rybody in every nation
Join with the angels
And lift high His name
And clap your hands
Just clap your hands
Clap your hands
And let the whole world know
He's the King of glory
The King of glory
The King of glory
The King of glory
The King of glory
The King of glory
The King of glory
He's the Lord God strong and mighty
Said He is the Prince of Peace
Jehovah Jireh
The Lord God strong and mighty
The Lord God mighty in battle
The Lord God strong and mighty
The Lord God mighty in battle
Help me lift Jesus higher
Help me lift Jesus higher and higher
Help me lift Jesus higher
Put your hands together
And praise the Lord for He is worthy
He is the King of glory
He is the King of glory
