Oh, the worshipper in me
Who wants to be free
From the cares of life
That seem to weigh me down

Yes, the worshipper in me
Needs consistency
To lift my hands
To give you praise
When no one's around

Oh, the worshipper in me
Wants to break free
From the intellectual mentality
Like when I should be up
I'm seated in my seat
I should be lifting my hands
Giving you praise and glory

I should be giving you more
More
I should be giving you more

I wanna give my best to you
I wanna do what you ask me to 
I wanna go wherever you say
Just say the word and I will obey
I wanna live a life that's reaI 
I wanna serve you, Lord, for real
For you deserve all this and more

I give you more 
I give you more 
I give you more 
I give you more 
More, more, more
