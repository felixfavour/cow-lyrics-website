There's a peace I've come to know
Though my heart and flesh may fail
There's an anchor for my soul
I can say "it is well"[Pre-Chorus]
Jesus has overcome
And the grave is overwhelmed
The victory is won
He is risen from the dead
And i will rise when he calls my name
No more sorrow, no more pain
I will rise on eagles' wings
Before my god fall on my knees
And rise
I will rise
There's a day that's drawing near
When this darkness breaks to light
And the shadows disappear
And my faith shall be my eyes
