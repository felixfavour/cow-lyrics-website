for all you've done
for all you're going to do
we give you thanks
and lift out praise to you
we give you thanks
we give you praise
for we know that all things work together for our good
we give thanks
we give you praise
for by faith
we know your grace
will see us through
for all those things
that we don't understand
we come by faith
and place them in your hands
even if we stumble
even if we fall
you will not forsake us
you are king and lord of all
lord of all
