May the peace of God
Calm your heart and your mind
Through the tears and the trials
The heartache of this life
And when you can't hold on
Know He holds you still
He will keep you, never leave you
He promised that He will
[Pre-Chorus]
'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to take Him at His Word
Just to rest upon His promise
Just to know that if He said it
[Refrain]
It's already done
May the grace of God
Overshadow you
Through the chaos, the failures
Through The fire you're walking through
