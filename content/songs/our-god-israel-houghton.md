Water You turned into wine
Opened the eyes of the blind
There's no one like You
None like You
Into the darkness You shine
Out of the ashes we rise
There's no one like You
None like You
Our God is greater
Our God is stronger
God, You are higher than any other
Our God is healer
Awesome in power
Our God, our God
Into the darkness You shine
Out of the ashes we rise
There's no one like You
None like You, none like You
Our God is greater
Our God is stronger
God, You are higher than any other
