Christmas is the day
The angels came to say
They said be not afraid
For born on this day
Born to save is Christ The Lord
Sheperds watched by night
When that angel appeared from on high
And said be not afraid for born on this day
Born to save is Christ The Lord
Christ the Lord
Wise men from afar
Said they followed the eastern star
Followed it to this place
For born on this day
Born to save is Christ The Lord
Born this day
Christmas day
Born to save the world is Christ the Lord
they said be not afraid
For born on this day
Born to save is Christ The Lord
Christ The Lord
He's GOd the Father, God the Son and Holy Spirit
Christmas is the day
When the angels appeared to say
They said be not afraid
For born on this day
Born to save is Christ The Lord
Born this day
Christmas day
Born to save the world is Christ the Lord
They said be not afraid
For born on this day
Born to save our lives
His name is Jesus Christ
He is Emmanuel
He is Christ
And he is born to save
He's Christ the Lord
