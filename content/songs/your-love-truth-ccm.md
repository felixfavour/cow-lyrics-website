Where can I go from Your Spirit
How can I escape Your love?
Your love for me
Is deeper than the sea
And higher than the heavens above
Where can I flee from Your Presence
Now that You abide in my heart
My heart is Your home
Your temple, Your throne
So what could ever keep us apart?
From Your love
It's higher than the heavens
Your love is deeper than the oceans
Nothing in creation can take me away
From Your love, Your love
(Your love, sweet love)
Your lov , there is nothing great r
Your love, there is nothing stronger
You came to me and gave Your life
So I could be free
Oh, so free
Who can explain Your mercy
Who can comprehend Your Ways
You showed me grace
By taking my place
And washing all my sorrow away
I just want to live in Your presence
Worship You with all of my heart
Show me the way
Draw me closer each day
Don't let anything keep us apart
