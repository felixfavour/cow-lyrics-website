[Instrumental]
Slow down, take time
"Breathe in," He said
He'd reveal what's to come
The thoughts in His mind
Always higher than mine
He'll reveal all to come
So take courage my heart
Stay steadfast my soul
He's in the waiting
He's in the waiting
And hold onto your hope
As your triumph unfolds
He's never failing
He's never failing
Sing praise my soul
Find strength in joy
Let His words lead you on
Do not forget
His great faithfulness
He'll finish all He's begun
