[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Oh, wretched man that I am
Who will free me from this body of death?
I'm so glad that Your reach is further than my run
And I know that every fall, You catch me
Sayin' I can always trust You
Even though I got these trust issues
You chose me, I didn't choose You
Showin' me a love I never knew
[Pre-Chorus: Ryan Ellis]
It's not easy for me
'Cause I like to lead
But I know that Your love is better
You're the air that I breathe
And You're holdin' all things
Yeah, I know that Your love is better
[Chorus: Ryan Ellis]
So I will hold tight
God, I know You got something in store for me
Faithful as the sunris–µ
I know that Your light will always shine on me
