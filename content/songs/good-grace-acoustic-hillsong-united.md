People come together
Strange as neighbours
Our blood is one
Children of generations
Of every nation
Of kingdom come
Don't let your heart be troubled
Hold your head up high
Don't fear no evil
Fix your eyes on this one truth
God is madly in love with you
Take courage
Hold on, be strong
Remember where our help comes from
Jesus, our redemption
Our salvation is in His blood
Jesus, light of heaven
Friend forever, His kingdom come
So don't let your heart be troubled
Hold your head up high
Don't fear no evil
Fix your eyes on this one truth
God is madly in love with you
So take courage
Hold on, be strong
Remember where our help comes from
