Awaken my soul, come awake
To hunger, to seek, to thirst
Awaken first love, come awake
And do as You did, at first
Spirit of the living God come fall afresh on me
Come wake me from my sleep
Blow through the caverns of my soul
Pour in me to overflow
Spirit of the living God come fall afresh on me
Come wake me from my sleep
Blow through the caverns of my soul
Pour in me to overflow
To overflow
[Bridge]
Spirit come and fill this place
Let Your glory now invade
Spirit come and fill this place
Let Your glory now invade
Spirit of the living God come fall afresh on me
Come awake me from my sleep
Blow through the caverns of my soul
Pour in me to overflow
