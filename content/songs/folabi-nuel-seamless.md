There are words in my heart for the King of Glory
Oh my heart longs to let them out
melodies in my heart for the King of glory
oh my heart longs to let them out
And I've found a place
You are everywhere
and I've found a time
right here right now
There are tears in my heart for the king of glory
Oh my heart longs to let them out
melodies in my heart for the King of glory
oh my heart longs to let them out
And I've found a place
You are everywhere
and I've found a time
right here right now
Yes I've found a place
You are everywhere
and I've found a time
right here right now
Seamless they flow
all these words flow to you
see how they roll
all these words flow to you
Seamless they flow
all these words flow to you
see how they roll
all these words flow to you
There are words in my heart for the King of Glory
Oh my heart longs to let them out
melodies in my heart for the King of glory
oh my heart longs to let them out
