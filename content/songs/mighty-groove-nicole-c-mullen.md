Let 'em have it, Bubbles!
Well, have you heard
Through the blood of Jesus
We have victory
(You know what time it is)
Yes, in His word
It says when we resist the devil
He must flee
(That's what I'm sayin')
I'm sick and tired
Of people livin' life in apathy
Hey, mighty is the Lord
(Girl, I know just what you're talkin' about)
(Mighty is the Lord)
Whoa, mighty is the Lord
(To You we adore)
Hey, to You we adore
(Mighty is the Lord)
Whoa, mighty is the Lord
Kick it, Ge-Gee!
A mighty God is the one you serve
I can't believе it when you lack the nervе
Just stand on the Word
And kick the devil in the face
You've run the race, just keep up the pace
