Alleluia alleluia
For the Lord God Almighty reigns
Alleluia alleluia
For the Lord God Almighty reigns
Alleluia
Holy holy
Are You Lord God Almighty
Worthy is the Lamb
Worthy is the Lamb
You are holy holy
Are You Lord God Almighty
Worthy is the Lamb
Worthy is the Lamb
Amen
In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope without light
Till from heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfil the law and prophets
To a virgin came the Word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt
And praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of kings
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
Oh for even in Your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Oh Jesus for our sake You died
Praise the Father
And praise the Son
And praise the Spirit oh three in one
And God of glory
Majesty
And praise forever to the King of kings
And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored
And the Church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel shall not faint
By His blood and in His Name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me oh
Sing praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of kings
Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of kings
Praise forever to the King of kings
We praise forever to the King of kings
