Amplify your anthem of grace within my soul
Let me hear the wonders of your redeeming love
And let me hear those saving words
You spoke upon the cross
It is finished it is finished
Oh what else is there to say
Shame is silenced death defeated
Hallelujah god be praised
No more condemnation you had the final word
There's nothing that can hold me
There's nothing now to dread
Oh I can hear those healing words
You cried upon the cross
It is finished it is finished
Oh what else is there to say
Shame is silenced death defeated
Hallelujah god be praised
O it is finished it is finished
Oh what else is there to say
Shame is silenced death defeated
Hallelujah god be praised
I hear a symphony of grace
Your song of mercy called my name
I stand in awe I stand amazed
Hallelujah god be praised
I hear a symphony of grace
Your song of mercy called my name
I stand in awe I stand amazed
Hallelujah god be praised
O god be praised
There's no more condemnation
You had the final word
Yes you had the final word
Say
It is finished it is finished
Oh what else is there to say
Shame is silenced death defeated
Hallelujah god be praised
O it is finished it is finished
Oh what else is there to say
Shame is silenced death is defeated
Hallelujah god be praised
Shame is silenced death is defeated
Hallelujah god be praised
God be praised
