This is my prayer in the dessert
When all that's within me
Feels dry
This is my prayer
In my hunger and need
My God is the God who provides
This is my pryaer in the fire
In weakness or trial or pain
There is a faith proved of more worth than gold
So refine me lord through the flame
I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon formed agaist me shall remain
I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here
This is my prayer in the battle
When triumph is still on its way
I am a conqueror
And co-heir with Christ
So firm on His promise i'll stand
