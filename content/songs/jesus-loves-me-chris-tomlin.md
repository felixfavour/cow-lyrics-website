I was lost
I was in chains
The world had a hold of me
My heart was a stone
I was covered in shame
When He came for me
[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't run, couldn't run from His presence
I couldn't run, couldn't run from His arms
Jesus, He loves me, He loves me, He is for me
Jesus, how can it be, He loves me, He is for me
And it was a fire
Deep in my soul
I'll never be the same
I stepped out of the dark
And into the light
When He called my name
[Pre-Chorus]
I couldn't run, couldn't run from His presence
I couldn't run, couldn't run from His arms
