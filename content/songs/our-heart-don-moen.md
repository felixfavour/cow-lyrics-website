Our Heart our desire
Is to see the nations worship
Our cry our prayer
Is to sing your praise
To the ends of the earth
That with one mighty voice
Every tribe and tongue rejoices
Our Heart our desire
Is to see the nations worship You
Heavenly Father
Your mercy showers
Down upon Your people
Every race upon the earth
May Your Spirit pierce the darkness
Break the chains of death upon us
Let us rise in honest worship
To declare Your matchless worth
