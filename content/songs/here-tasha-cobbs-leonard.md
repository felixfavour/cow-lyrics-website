[Intro]
Oh I wanna see You
I, I wanna see You
No distractions
I wanna know You're here
Right here, right now
I wanna see You
No distractions
I wanna know You're here
Somebody ask Him, say
I wanna see You
No distractions (no distractions)
I wanna know You're here
I wanna see You (I wanna see You)
No distractions (no distractions)
I wanna know You're here
This is our prayer
Let us see You (let us see You)
No distractions (no distractions)
(We need to know You're here)
We just wanna see You
Let us see You (let us see You)
No distractions (no distractions)
(We need to know You're here)
