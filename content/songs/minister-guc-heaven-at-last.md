Ah, ah ah, aah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah ah, aah, ah, ah, ah
Patiently waiting for the Time
You will Take me
Take me to the Place where I Belong
Where it all Started
Where the Angels Sing in Tongues
(Speaking in Tongues)
Earnestly waiting, Patiently waiting
For the day you'll come
And take us Home, Lord
Earnestly waiting,
Desperately waiting
For my Groom,
The one who Loves me dearly

Heaven at Last, Heaven at Last
Heaven at Last, Heaven at Last
Heaven at Last
That's what we will Sing
On that Day
(Heaven at Last, Heaven at Last
Heaven at Last, Heaven at Last) [x2]
Patiently waiting for the Time
You will Take me
Take me to the Place where I Belong
Where it all Started
Where the Angels singing Halle  nHallelujah, Hallelujah
Earnestly waiting, Patiently waiting
For the day you'll come
And take us Home
Patiently waiting, Patiently waiting
For my Groom,
The one who Loves me dearly

{ Heaven at Last, Heaven at Last
Heaven at Last, Heaven at Last
Heaven at Last, Heaven at Last
Heaven at Last } [x2]
[Bridge]
{ Get ready, Get ready
All ye Saints of God
Get ready, Get ready
He'll be Right here at last } [x2]
{ Heaven at Last, Heaven at Last
Get ready, Get ready
Heaven at Last, Heaven at Last
All ye Saints of God
Heaven at Last, Heaven at Last
Get ready, Get ready
Heaven at Last, Heaven at Last
He'll be Right here at last } [x2
