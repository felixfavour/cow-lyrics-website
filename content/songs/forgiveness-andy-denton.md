I say I will and then I won't
I say I do and then I don't
It happens everyday
I hate the sinner, love the sin
It's a sorry state I'm in
Don't want to live this way
When I cast the killing stone
The fate I'm sealing is my own
When I know that what we need
Is forgiveness, forgiveness
We can't live without
Forgiveness, forgiveness
And that's what life's about
Forgiveness
I say forgive and then forget
I haven't learned to do it yet
You'd think I'd know by now
Been on both sides of the gun
See that damage will be done
Pull the trigger anyhow, ah, yeah
When I'm hating someone else
All I'm hurting is myself
I've got to let it go
