When I call you, you always Answer
There's no name
Higher than your name
When I call you
Chains are Broken, Lord
There's no name
Higher than your name
Whenever I call you, burdens are Lifted
There's no name
Higher than your name
Cause when I call you
There is a Shifting
No name, No name, No name
Name above all names
Strong Tower, Mountain Mover
Unchanging Changer
No other name Wiser
No other name Stronger
No other name Higher than your name
Jesus, Jesus, there's no name
Higher than your name
Jesus, Jesus, there's no name
Higher than your name
Jesus, Jesus, there's no name
Higher than your name
