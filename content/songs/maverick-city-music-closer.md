Like the rushing wind
Would You breathe within my heart, heart?
And through the raging storm
Would You hold me in Your arms, arms?
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Lake]
'Cause I need You
How I need You
I need Your love like I need water
I need Your love like I need breath inside of my lungs
Burn in my heart just like a fire
Come and take me over
Jesus, draw me closer to Your heart
To Your heart
And through the wind and rain
I can hear You call my name, name
And when the nights get rough
I will still sing out Your praise
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Lake]
'Cause I need You
How I need You
I need You
I need Your love like I need water
And I need Your love like I need brÐµath inside of my lungs
Burn in my heart just like a firÐµ
Come and take me over
Jesus, draw me closer to Your heart
Your heart, Your heart

And closer than my every breath
Closer than my every step
Closer than the song I sing
Closer than anything
Closer than my every breath
Closer than my every step
Closer than the song I sing
Closer than anything (Closer)
Closer than my every breath
Closer than my every step
Closer than the song I sing
Closer than anything
I need Your love like I need water
I need Your love like I need breath inside of my lungs
Burn in my heart just like a fire
Come and take me over
Jesus, draw me closer
I need Your love like I need water
I need Your love like I need breath inside of my lungs
Burn in my heart just like a fire
Come and take me over
Jesus, draw me closer to Your heart
Your heart, Your heart
[Post-Chorus: Brandon Lake]
It's where I wanna be forever
In Your heart, Your heart, Your heart
'Cause I don't wanna move without You
I just wanna be in Your heart, Your heart, Your heart
Your heart, Your heart
So come and take me over
Jesus, draw me closer to Your heart
[Outro: Chandler Moore & Brandon Lake]
So pull me a little closer
Take me a little deeper
I want to know Your heart
I want to know Your heart
`Cause Your love is so much sweeter
Than anything I've tasted
I want to know Your heart
I want to know Your heart
So pull me a little closer
Take me a little deeper
I want to know Your heart
I want to know Your heart
`Cause Your love is so much sweeter
Than anything I've tasted
I want to know Your heart
I want to know Your heart
