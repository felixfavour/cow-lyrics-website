[Intro: Yolanda Adams]
Oh Lord, Oh Lord
We lift you, ooh, we lift you up
Yeah yeah yeah
[Yolanda Adams]
Raise my voice in testimony
'Cause he's more than a friend to me
Gave my heart 'cause I believe he's the almighty
[Erica Campbell]
I can look at my life and see
All the things that He's done to set me free
Protecting me from harm
[Donnie McClurkin]
Raise my hands to show how I feel
His presence is oh so real
'Till he's guiding me, I'll be still
'Cause I'd be lost without him
[Tina Campbell]
My heart and soul I dedicate and to show I appreciate his love
I'll give him praise
[Chorus:]
Lift Him up
Each and everyday we celebrate our faith
Lift Him up
In a song of praise thanking him for everything
Lift Him up
Devotion I express because I know I'm blessed
Lift Him up
Praise Him with every breath
Glorify His name, Lift Him up
