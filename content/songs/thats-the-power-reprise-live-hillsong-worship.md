Do you guys believe that tonight?
[Spontaneous]
'Cause if there's no miracle
Then You're not finished yet
'Cause You do impossible
Like no one else can
Oh, if there's no miracle
Then must be one up ahead
For You're the same God now
As You've always been
[Bridge]
I see You taking ground
I see You press ahead
Your power is dangerous to the enemy's camp
You still do miracles
You will do what You said
For You're the same God now as You've always been
Your Spirit breaking out
Your kingdom moving in
Your victory claims the ground that thе enemy had
(At least hе thought he did)
You still do miracles
You will do what You said
For You're the same God now as You've always been
