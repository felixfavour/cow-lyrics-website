Skies spin their dance
Within Your breath
Time runs its race
Within Your hand
And my mind runs wild
To comprehend
What no mind on earth
Could understand
Your ways are higher
Your thoughts are wilder
Love came like madness
Poured out in blood - wash romance
It makes no sense but this is grace
And I know You're with me in this place
[Bridge 1]
Here now
All I know is I know that You are
Here now
Still my heart
Let Your voice be all I hear now
Spirit breathe
Like the wind come have Your way
Cause I know You're in this place
