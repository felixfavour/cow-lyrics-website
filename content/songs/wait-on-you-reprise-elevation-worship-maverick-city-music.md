Get a little stronger (Get a little stronger)
See you get a little stronger now
You get a little stronger
Stay right there because you
Get a little stronger now
You get a little stronger
Stay right there
'Cause you get a little stronger
You get a little stronger
It's not by might nor strength
You get a little stronger
By the Spirit of the Lord, I say
You get a little stronger
Stay right there 
bеcause you get a little strongеr
Get a little stronger
You get a little stronger
 (Get a little stronger)
