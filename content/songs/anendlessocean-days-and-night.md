Get my hurt undone Yea promise Keep burning my side of the flame Like stories untold Keep me hidden in the pages of your escape Cause wanna give my all to you Do you see it I'm needy I'm calling your name Oh that's my passion Its wholly hearted Ain't done with the chase And should the dark find it's way Would you take me away Into your light Would you hold me through the days And through the nights Cause when my hearts failing And when l'm wasted And when it feels like all have's gone to pieces Oh Would you take me away Into your light Oh gotta get up Yea my rising and my falling is at your feet Without you there's no me Oh I am with "us" together "Alone" is withering, It's all dead and gone Hold me and wherever it is You take me away Into your light Would you hold me through the days And through the nights Cause when my hearts failing And when I'm wasted And when it feels like all have's gone to pieces Oh Would you take me away Into your light
