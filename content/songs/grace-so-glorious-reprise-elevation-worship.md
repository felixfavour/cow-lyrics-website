Ephesians 1:6 says that we have been adopted as sons and daughters through Jesus Christ to the praise of His glorious grace. What of this glorious grace? Not a grace that simply covers our sin, but a grace that after it has covered our sin empowers us to rise up in victory to overcome sin, to overcome the world, to overcome the works of the devil. A glorious grace. The Puritan preacher Thomas Brooks said this, "Grace and glory differ very little. One is the seed, the other is the flower. Grace is glory militant. Glory is grace triumphant." So we lift our hands in surrender to say, "You and You alone, Lord, can cover my sin. You and You alone, Jesus, are worthy to be praised." But we don't just throw up our hands in desperation; we throw up our hands in victory for grace and glory. And glory and grace are triumphant in the life of the believer who will call upon the Name of Jesus. God, fill this place with grace, fill our lives with glory
Crowned in glory to glory
Worthy is the Lord of all
The glory forever
Holy is the Lord
Crowned in glory to glory
Worthy is the Lord of all
The glory forever
Holy is the Lord
