[Spoken Interlude]
How we doing people, you all right?
I have to keep slapping myself in the face 'cause, like, is this real life? You know what I mean
But we're just so grateful that everyone would be here
Maybe you're here, someone duped you into coming
You were expecting Billy Joel or something and
Here's the thing, I don't believe that anybody's here by accidеnt
The saying says, "You don't have to beliеve to belong, you're welcome in this place just the way you are"This has gotta be the most storied room in the greatest city on earth
But tonight, tonight it's ours
And we got nothing tonight without the presence of God
Because God, for all His mystery, is able to stir this place up
Until it folds inside-out and I believe that might happen tonight
And so, one time, before we get started, regardless of where you're sitting
Regardless of where you've come from
Can we just, one time, make as much noise as we can to get this thing started right?
To the Man above every single hand tonight
One, two, three, come on
See, I don't know about you, but I just think it sounds better when we're all in it together
You know what I'm saying?
That's what tonight's about, come on
