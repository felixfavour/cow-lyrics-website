you unravel me
with a melody
you surround me
with a song
of deliverance
from my enemies
til all my fears are gone
am no longer
a slave to fear
I'm a child of God
am no longer
a slave to fear
I'm a child of God
from my mother's womb
you have chosen me
love have called
my name
I've been born again
into your family
your blood flow
through my veins
I'm no longer
a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer
a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer
a slave to fear
I am a child of God
ooooo
ooooo
ooooo
ooooo
ooooo
You split the sea
So I could walk
right through it
my fears were drowned
in perfect love
You rescued me
so I could stand and sing
I am the child of God
You split the sea
So I could walk
right through it
my fears were drowned
in perfect love
You rescued me
so I could stand and sing
I am a child of God
I am a Child of God
I am a Child of God
I am a Child of God
