Oh God, my God I seek You
I wanna move when You move
You're more than I could long for
I thirst for You
You're an ocean to my soul
To my soul
Your love is like a waterfall, waterfall
Running wild and free
You hear my heart when I call, when I call
Deep calls, too deep
Your love is like a waterfall, waterfall
Raining down on me
Waterfall, waterfall
Oh God, my God I seek You
In this dry and desert land
You lead me to streams of mercy
Once again
[Bridge]
Waterfall, waterfall
It's coming like a flood
I'm dancing in the rain
Everything I've done
Is covered in rivers of grace, amazing
It's coming like a flood
I'm dancing in the rain
I lift up my hands
Your love never changes, amazing
