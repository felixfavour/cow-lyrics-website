Verse 1]
These Dry Bones will Rise again
Cause the Stone
Has been Rolled away
At the Touch of Living Water
This Broken Branch
Will Live again
These Fallen Walls
Will be Restored, says the Lord
So Hear his Voice
As he Calls all those Bones

Arise, Come Alive
It's not Over
Till Jehovah says it is
Arise, Come Alive
Mighty Shephard
Must Fulfil your Destiny
Arise!
These Dry Bones will Rise again
And the Barren will Sing Again
Out of the Dust
And from the Ashes
Will Arise new Life again
That which was Dead
Will Live again, Says the Lord
So Arise!, Take up your Bed
And Move, Yeah
That which is Lost, I will Restore
So Hear his Voice
As he Calls all those Bones

Arise, Come Alive
It's not Over
Till Jehovah says it is
Arise, Come Alive
Mighty Shephard
Must Fulfil your Destiny
[Bridge]
{Come Forth, Come Forth
(Com Forth, Come Forth)
Come Forth, Come Forth
(It's not Over)
Till Jehovah says it is} [x2]
No, It's not Over
It's not Over, It's not Over
New Begining, New Begining
New Begining, New Begining
[Outro]
(No), Come Forth, Come Forth
(It's not Over)
Come Forth, Come Forth
(New Begining, New Begining)
Come Forth, Come Forth
(Out of your Belly shall Flow)
Come Forth, Come Forth
