In my mother’s womb
You formed me with Your hands
Known and loved by You
Before I took a breath
[Pre-Chorus 1: Pat Barrett]
When I doubt it, Lord, remind me
I’m wonderfully made
You’re an artist and a potter
I’m the canvas and the clay
[Chorus: Pat Barrett]
You make all things
Work together
For my future
And for my good
You make all things
Work together
For Your glory
And for Your name
There’s a healing light
Just beyond the clouds
Though I’ve walked through fire
I see clearly now
