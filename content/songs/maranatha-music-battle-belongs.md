When all I see is your battle
you see my victory
When all I see is the mountains
you see mountains move
And as I walk through the shadows
your help surrounds me
There's nothing to fear now
for I'm safe with you.
(instruments)
(......chorus......)
For in a fight I'll
Fight on my kneels
with my hands lifted high
oh God, the battle belongs to you
and every fear I'll lay in your feet
I'll sing through the night
oh God, the battle belongs to you.
(instruments)
And if you are for me,
who can be against me?
for Jesus there's nothing
impossible for him
When all I see are the ashes
you see the beauty...(faithful God)
When all I see is a cluster
you see me prepared
(.......chorus.)
