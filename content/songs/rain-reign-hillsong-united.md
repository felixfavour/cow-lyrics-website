Everything starts in You
Made to be beautiful
Nothing could tear Your heart
From the covenant You made for love
Everything moves in time
Played into Your design
Nothing could tear Your heart
From the world You died to save
You fall like rain
In fire and thunder
The mountains melt
Like wax before You
Everything finds its place
Folding beneath Your ways
Nothing could stand against
Your resurrected Name
You fall like rain
In fire and thunder
The mountains melt
Like wax before You
Your kingdom reigns
In everlasting grace and wonder
Your love making all things new
Your love making everything beautiful
