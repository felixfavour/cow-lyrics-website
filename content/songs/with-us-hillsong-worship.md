Before the world, You knew the plans for me
Before my heart believed, You came to my rescue
And now I'm found in love
There's nowhere else to run
You keep my life within Your mighty hand
Oh, God
There's no end to Your love
There's no end to Your love
You're with us
You're with us
There's nothing in this world
That could take You away
You're with us
You're with us
Before I call, I know You'll answer me
You'll make a way beyond what I could imagine
What could separate from the love You gave
I put my hope in everything that You are
Oh, God
There's no end to Your love
There's no end to Your love
You're with us
You're with us
There's nothing in this world
That could take You away
You're with us
You're with us
