A longing stirs in my soul
Draws me near
Calls me close
Deeper into this love
That won't run out
Won't dry up
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Only now will I come
Before your throne, holy one
By your thunderous grace
Spirit flood, come flood this place
Oh, let it rain
Oh, let it rain
Let your glory fall
Overwhelm my soul
Let your presence flood my life, oh lord
Deep is calling to deep
Revivals tide, breaking free
Jesus reign in this place
Thirsty we cry, heaven in vain
Let your glory fall
Overwhelm my soul
Let your presence flood my life, oh Lord
