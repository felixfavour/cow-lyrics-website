We lie to our lovers
We lie to our friends
Painting our pictures and playing pretend
We keep our secrets all to ourselves
Stand at a distance, so no one can tell
And nobody knows us and nobody will
We all keep pretending we're better but still
We keep our secrets to cover our shame
You see the darkness and You love us the same
We run from our troubles
We run from our pain
Gather the dirt, oh, and sweep it away
We put our mask on, pretending by fame
And carry our secrets with us to the grave
And nobody knows us and nobody will
We all keep pretending we're better but still
We keep our secrets to cover our shame
You see the darkness and You love us the same
