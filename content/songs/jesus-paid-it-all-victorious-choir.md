1. I hear the savior say, thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness, Watch and Pray
Find in me thine all in all

Chorus:

Jesus paid it all, All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow

2. Lord, Now indeed I find
Thy power and thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

Chorus:

Jesus paid it all, All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow

3. And when before the throne 
I stand in him complete 
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat 

Chorus:

Jesus paid it all, All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow

Oh, Praise the one who paid my debt and raised this life up from the dead/8x

Chorus:

Jesus paid it all, All to him I owe
Sind had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow
