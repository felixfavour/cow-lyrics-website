The head that once was crowned with thorns
Is crowned with glory now
The Saviour knelt to wash our feet
Now at His feet we bow
The One who wore our sin and shame
Now robed in majesty
The radiance of perfect love
Now shines for all to see
Your name, Your name is victory
All praise will rise to Christ our King
The fear that held us now gives way
To Him who is our peace
His final breath upon the cross
Is now alive in me
Your name, Your name is victory
All praise will rise to Christ our King
Your name, Your name is victory
All praise will rise to Christ our King
