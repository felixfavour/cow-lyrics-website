You are love, You are life
You are Lord over everything
Alpha, Omega, Jehovah, The King of Kings,
Wonderful, Waymaker, Worthy of my offering
Hallowed be thy name
REPEAT CHORUS
You're the answer to all of my problems and You solve them
(Hallowed be thy name)
You supply all my needs and I call you Abba Father
(Hallowed be thy name)
You're a mighty fortress in the time of tribulation
(Hallowed be thy name)
And I'm more than a conqueror in every situation
(Hallowed be thy name)
CHORUS
You're the only God and there will never be another
(Hallowed be thy name)
Ten thousand angels couldn't say how much I love You
(Hallowed be thy name)
So I'm gonna lift you up Lord higher and higher
(Hallowed be thy name)
And all the world will see how You set my soul on fire
(Hallowed be thy name)
