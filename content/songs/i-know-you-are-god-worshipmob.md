[Intro]
The world tried to tell me, mm
That my joy is in money
The world tried to teach me
That I can do it on my own
Oh, the world tried to show me
You're not who You say You are
But now I know better, I know better
To know You are God (To know You are good)
I know You are God (I know You are good)
I know You are God (I know You are God)
I know You are God (I know You are God)
I know You are God (I know You are God)
You're so much better (I know You are God)
You're so much better (I know You are God)
You're so much better, yeah (I know You are God)
I know You are God (I know You are God)
I know You are God (I know You are God)
I know You are God (I know You are God)
I know You are God (I know You are God)
I know You are God, oh (I know You are God)
To worship You, I live
To worship You, I live
I live to worship You (We bow before You, Jesus, You're the only one that's worthy)
To worship You, I live
To worship You, I live
I live to worship You (Yeah, You alone, You alone, God)
To worship You, I live
To worship You, I live
I live to worship You (Only You, 
I live to worship You
)
To worship You, I live
To worship You, I live
