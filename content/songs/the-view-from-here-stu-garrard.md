[Instrumental]
I don't know where Your thoughts begin
But I know it's where Your heart is
There's a light I can't comprehend
But when I close my eyes it finds me
And nothing ever looked like this
The wonder of a world I missed
The clarity I find in grace
Never thought I'd see this way
You've been there everytime I fall
Been there through it all
All this time to show me
The view from here
I don't know where the valley ends
But the road is paved with mercy
And I can see how the river bends
'Cause its waters flow straight through me
And nothing ever looked like this
The wonder of a world I missed
The clarity I find in grace
Never thought I'd see this way
You've been there everytime I fall
Been there through it all
All this time to show me
The view from here
