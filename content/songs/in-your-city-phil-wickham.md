Oh, the glorious day when we arrive
And Heaven's gates are opened wide
All our fear and pain will fade away
When we see You face to face
[Pre-Chorus]
Our great and awesome King
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You, will reign in brilliant light
Forever glorified in Your city
And we, Your daughters and Your sons
Will see the kingdom come in Your city
Love will reign and joy will have no end
When the saints go marching in
God, we pray that You come soon
'Cause we were made to be with You
[Pre-Chorus]
Our great and awesome King
