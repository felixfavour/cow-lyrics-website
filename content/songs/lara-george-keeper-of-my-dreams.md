ohhh ohh ohh oh oh oh Humm hmm
I will lift up my eyes to the skies
From whence cometh my help
My help comes from the lord
Maker of all
He will not allow my foot to be moved
He who keeps me will not sleep
Or take a nap
His arm is not too short to rescue me
Holy one of Israel
Saviour to me
Father You are my help
Keeper of all my dreams
Holy one of Israel
Saviour to me
Father You are my help
Keeper of all my dreams

Arugbo ojo mo juba re
Onibu ore, l'oruko re ooo
 Mo yin o l'ogo, yin o l'ogo oooooo
Holy one of Israel Saviour to me

 Keeper of all my dreams
