I FEEL THE TOUCH OF HANDS SOFT AND TENDER, THEY'RE LEADING ME IN THE PATHS THAT I MUST GO I HAVE NO FEAR FOR JESUS WALKS BESIDE ME AND I'M SHELTERED IN THE ARMS OF GOD.

SO LET THE STORMS RAGE HIGH THE DARK CLOUDS RISE THEY WON'T WORRY ME FOR I'M SHELTERED SAFE WITHIN THE ARMS OF GOD HE WALKS WITH ME AND NAUGHT OF EARTH CAN HARM ME FOR I'M SHELTERED IN THE ARMS OF GOD.

SOON I SHALL HEAR THAT CALL FROM HEAVENS PORTALS COME HOME MY CHILD IT'S THE LAST MILE YOU MUST GO THEN I'LL FALL ASLEEP AND WAKE IN GODS NEW HEAVEN SHELTERED SAVE WITHIN THE ARMS OF GOD.

SO LET THE STORMS RAGE HIGH THE DARK CLOUDS RISE THEY WON'T WORRY ME FOR I'M SHELTERED SAFE WITHIN THE ARMS OF GOD HE WALKS WITH ME AND NAUGHT OF EARTH CAN HARM ME FOR I'M SHELTERED IN THE ARMS OF GOD.
