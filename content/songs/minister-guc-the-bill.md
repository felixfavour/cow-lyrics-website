Long ago
You were bruised and pierced
You were broken and shamed for me
Your body was dragged to the floor
You laid on the cross
You died for me
You didnt have a pen
To sign the cheque for me
All you had was love your name and your blood
Your love was real
It was so real
You did it all for me
For me
{GUC - The Bill Lyrics & Mp3 Download_}
The bill is on you Jesus
The bill is on you (2x)
You signed the cheque on the cross
You paid in full with your blood(2x)
(Native part)
Okini mezé méh
(What would I have done)
Okini mezé méh
(What would I have done)

(Adlips)
For thou was slain
And has redeemed us to God on high
Nothing is too difficult
Nothing is too difficult
Jesus you have done it all
Jesus you have taken away the sins
The borthers
Tell it to the world
Tell it to the sickness
Tell it to those pains
Tell it to the problem
Tell it oh
Let them hear
That Jesus is king
That Jesus is lord
He has paid it all completely
