You made a Way
Where there was no Way
Lord, There is no one like You
You are the Way
You are the Truth and Life
There is no one like You
The Wilderness is now
A Fruitful Ground
There is no one like You
The Stone the Builders rejected
Is now the Chief Cornerstone
There is no one like You
[Bridge]
{Aka, aka Ya, Aka, aka Ya
Aka eh, Aka Jehovah
Na'eme Mma
(The Hand of Jehovah
Is doing Good) } [x2]
When the enemy comes like a Flood
I just shut him up
In the Name of Jesus
Cause Your Name is Great
Cus Your Name is Power
Cus Your Name is Mighty One
No One like You
Let's Talk about
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
They were thrown in the Fire
But You became
The Fourth Man in the Fire
Oh God, No One like You
Frank Edwards  No One Like You Lyrics
What about Daniel
In the Lion's Den
He was Left to be Devoured
By the Lion
But You Stepped in
Everything Changed, Oh God
No One like You
What about Paul and Silas
They Prayed,
They Sang Hallelujah
And the Spirit of the Lord
Came down
No One like You
What about me, what about me
What about me, what about me
You put Your Spirit
Oh God in me
And then You said that I'm
The Apple of Your Eyes
[Outro]
Nobody can Challenge You
Nobody can Challenge You
No Cabal, no disease
No demons, no devil, no infirmity
You're Bigger than them all
You're bigger than them all
So I come in the Name of Jesus
In the Name of Jesus
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
We Conquer in the name of Jesus
We Triumph in the Name of Jesus
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
