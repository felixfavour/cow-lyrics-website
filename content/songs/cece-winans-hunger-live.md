This world could never satisfy
The longing in my soul
When all is lost and hope is dry
When all I feel is cold
I'm coming back to Your presence
I'm coming back to Your presence
'Cause there's a hunger and a thirst
I am desperate, immerse me
I'm not waiting, not anymore
I need You, Lord, I need You, Lord
I feel it burning like a fire
Stronger than before
You are the One that I desire
I couldn't ask for more
I'm coming back to Your presence
I'm coming back to Your presence
'Cause there's a hunger and a thirst
I am desperate, immerse me
I'm not waiting, not anymore
I need You, Lord, I need You, Lord
Hey, oh
Sweep me away
Sweep me away with You
Sweep me away, oh-oh
Sweep me away with You
Come and sweep me away
(I want to feel Your warm embrace)
Sweep me away with You
(I wanna see You face to face)
Sweep me away
(Sweep me, sweep me, me)
Sweep me away with You
'Cause there's a hunger and a thirst
I am desperate, immerse me
I'm not waiting, not anymore
I need You, Lord, I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord (come on)
I need You, Lord (lift Your hands and open up Your hearts and cry out)
I need You, Lord (I need You)
I need You, Lord (I can't live without You)
I need You, Lord (I can't live without You)
I need You, Lord, I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord (I need You, Lord)
I need You Lord (I need to feel Your warm embrace)
I need You Lord (I need to see You face to face)
I need You Lord (I really do, I really do)
I need You Lord (I need You)
I need You, Lord, I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord, I need You, Lord
'Cause there's a hunger and a thirst
I am desperate, immerse me
I'm not waiting, not anymore
I need You, Lord, I really need You, Lord
Still need You, Lord
Still want You, Lord
Still need You, Lord
Still want You, Lord
