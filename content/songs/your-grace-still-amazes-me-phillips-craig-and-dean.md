My faithful father
Enduring friend
Your tender mercy is like a river with no end
It overwhelms me
Covers my sin
Each time I come into your presence
I stand in wonder once again

Your grace still amazes me
Your love is still a mystery
Each day I fall on my knees
'Cause your grace still amazes me
Your grace still amazes me
