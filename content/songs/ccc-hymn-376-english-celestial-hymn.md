1. ESUS communicator of my soul,
The friend that can never forsake me
The King who turns sorrow to joy 
The comforter of my soul
Chorus: Jehovah-Nissi our Lord,
My own fortress I thank Thee
For founding this congregation
During my own life-time.

2. Amidst all enemies and hardships
You exalted us oâ€™ er earthy storms
Our Lord God we give Thee thanks
We thank thee we thank Thee.
Chorus: Jehovah-Nissi our Lord
My own fortress thank Thee... 
Amen
