The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Oh, a King is born, yeah
A King is born
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the east beyond them far
And to the earth, it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Oh, He is born
Oh, yes, He is
Hе is born
Then let us all with one accord
Sing praisеs to our heavenly Lord
That hath made Heaven and Earth of naught
And with His blood, mankind has bought
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King, born is the King
Christ is the King of Israel
