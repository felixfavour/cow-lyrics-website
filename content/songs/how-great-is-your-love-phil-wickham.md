From the darkness, I called Your name
Into darkness, Your mercy came
You called me out, lifted me up
How great is Your love
You bore my weakness
You took my shame
Buried my burdens in fields of grace
You called me out, lifted me up
How great is Your love
[Pre-Chorus]
From the heights of Heaven
You stepped down to earth
Innocent perfection
You gave Your life for us
And we are amazed
And we stand in awe
For we have been changed
By the power of the cross
How great, how great
How great is Your love
How great, how great
How great is Your love
How great, how great
How great is Your love for us
