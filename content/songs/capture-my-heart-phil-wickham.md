Send Your Spirit and move us
Lord, make Your presence known
Let Your fire, consume us
Jesus, we lift our souls to You
[Hook]
Here we are, Lord, for You
In my failure, and my weakness
Your strength is glorified
For Your Grace and Your forgiveness
Brought me from death to life
[Pre-Chorus]
In You
I'm alive in You
You capture my heart
In all of Your beauty
You cover my soul
In all of Your mercy
And Lord, I've fallen
So in love with You
