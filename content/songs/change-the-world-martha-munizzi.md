Rise up, take your place
Ready, activate
Freedom is on its way
With the love of God we could change the world
No more would we turn
The helpless our hearts burn
Justice is breaking chains
We can change the world
His love can change one hun, one mite
Give every nation's hope and life
Creation waits expectantly
His love is all we need
We can change the world
We can change the world
With the love of God we can change the world
Rise up, take your place
Ready, activate
Freedom is on its way
With the love of God we could change the world
No more would we turn
The helpless our hearts burn
Justice is breaking chains
We can change the world
