Holy Lord, from above
Fill us up, with Your love
For my heart and my flesh cry out for You
Son of God, Righteous one
By Your grace, we have come
Into Your presence Holy God, to seek Your face
Oh Holy Lord, we worship You
Almighty God, our hearts cry out before You
There is no other one like You
Holy, holy and Worthy, worthy as You
