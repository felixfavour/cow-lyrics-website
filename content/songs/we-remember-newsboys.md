How could we forget
When You touched the earth on that starry night
Angels sang glory to God on high
We remember
How could we forget
The moment the water became wine
Or stories of men leaving all behind
We remember
[Pre-Chorus: Michael Tait]
Your story burns upon our hearts
A beautiful and binding scar
Forever we will
Forever we will think of You
[Chorus: Michael Tait & Israel Houghton]
We remember
We remember You, O Lord
We remember
We remember You, O Lord
How could we forget
There in the garden, You cried for it
The city that cursed You and turned You in
We remember
How could we forget
Death has no power and we are free
But You thought of us 
there on calvary
We remember
