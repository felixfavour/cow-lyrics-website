You know our King won't be riding on a donkey next time (2x)
Some try to keep Him wrapped up in a manger
Some try to keep Him nailed up on a cross
Some try to keep Him held down in the cold dark grave
But He's coming on a white horse
The King of kings is coming
With fire in His eyes
The King of kings is coming
He's coming to the real world
He's gonna rule it with a rod of iron
You better bow now
Don't wait until it's finally too late (2x)
Some try to keep Him wrapped up in a manger
Some try to keep Him nailed up on a cross
Some try to keep Him held down in the cold dark grave
But He's coming on a white horse
The King of kings is coming
With fire in His eyes
The King of kings is coming
He's coming back to your world
He's gonna rule it with a rod of iron
