[Chorus: Brian Johnson]
You can have it all, Lord
Every part of my world
Take this life and breathe on
This heart that is now Yours
You can have it all, Lord
Every part of my world
Take this life and breathe on
This heart that is now Yours
Oh, the joy I've found
Surrendering my crowns
At the feet of the King
Who surrendered everything
And oh, the peace that comes
When I'm broken and undone
By Your unfailing grace
I can lift my voice and say
[Chorus: Brian Johnson]
You can have it all, Lord
Every part of my world
Take this life and breathe on
This heart that is now Yours
You can have it all, Lord
Every part of my world
Take this life and breathe on
This heart that is now Yours
