A thousand generations falling down in worship
To sing the song of ages to the Lamb

And all who've gone before us and all who will believe
Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb

Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all

All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all

And the Angels cry, Holy
All creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy

Holy forever

If you've been forgiven 
And if you've been redeemed
Sing the song forever to the Lamb

If you walk in freedom 
And if you bear His name
Sing the song forever to the Lamb

Sing the song forever and amen

And all the Angels cry, Holy
All creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy

Holy forever

Hear Your people sing, Holy
To the King of kings, Holy
And You will always be, Holy

Holy forever

Your Name is the highest
Your Name is the greatest
Your Name stands above them all

Above all thrones and dominions
And all powers and positions
Your Name stands above them all

Jesus, Your Name is the highest
Your Name is the greatest
Your Name, oh, it stands above them all

Above all thrones and dominions
And all powers and positions
Your Name, oh, it stands above them all

And the Angels cry, Holy
And all creation cries, Holy
You are lifted high, Holy

Holy forever

Hear your people sing, Holy
And to the King of kings, Holy
And You will always be, Holy

Holy forever

You will always be, Holy
Holy forever
