[Chorus]
Who the Son sets free, is free indeed
Who the Son sets free, is free indeed, yeah-ehh
You've already won the victory
You've already won it all for me
Hey, hey, heyy, hey-hey
Hey, hey, heyy, hey-heyy
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Hey, hey, heyy, hey-hey
(You've already won, yeah)
Hey, hey, heyy, hey-heyy
You call me out of the dark and pull me into the light
You said that I'm set apart and see me justified
You shook me out of my fear, You took the linens off
Now that Your presence is here, I believe it
Who the Son sets free, is free indeed
Who the Son sets free, is free indeed, yeah-ehh
You've already won the victory
You've already won it all for me
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Hey, hey, heyy, hey-hey
(You've already won, yeah)
Hey, hey, heyy, hey-heyy
