I hear You call me
I hear Your voice
I see Your face
Late in the night
You remind me Jesus
With You I'm able
Tell me to go
In Your power and might
I am able to be in Your power
All You've called me to be
I am able to go in Your strength
Where You've called me to go
I know that I can
Cause I'm in You
Cause You're in me
Though I'm a man
I know that these worldly limitations
Are nothing but lies in my head
I hear You call me
I hear Your voice
I see Your face
Late in the night
You remind me Jesus
With You I'm able
Tell me to go
In Your power and might
