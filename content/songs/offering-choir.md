All the days of my life I'll praise You
Everything that I have na You gave to me Baba
Lord I say for your Love I'm grateful
Jesu You love me plenty, you came to die for me

Jehovah Rapha Jehovah Nissi
I Am that I Am, The Great provider
I searched around, there's no one else like You
Lion of Judah: You're the mighty Man in battle


Aiyee! God has given me victory
Aiyee! He has given me victory
[Repeat]
Hallelujah eh (Halle) [Repeat]

Come and see what the Lord has done for me
He has taken away my sorrows and now I'm free!
Agam e buru hallelujah e buru (I will carry hallelujah)
Agam a para hallelujah para o (I will carry my praise)

Because of Jesus everyday na shakara I dey do
(Because of Jesus everyday I have a life worth showing off)
Double double heavenly blessings na him I dey receive (from Him I receive)
God Your Grace and mercies always dey follow me

When you see me dance,
I dance like a winner man 
When you see me dance,
I dance like a winner man

Dance like a winner man ooo
Dance like a winner man ooo
Oh oh oh winner man
Oh oh oh winner man
