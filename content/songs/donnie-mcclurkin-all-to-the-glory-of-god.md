(Intro)
I don't wanna sing about the pain anymore
Only wanna sing about the One I adore
And dedicate my life to Him
And be a sacrifice for Him
All to the glory of God
I don't wanna sing about the pain anymore
I only wanna sing about the One I adore
Dedicate my life to Him
Be a sacrifice for Him
All to the glory of God
All to the glory of God
All to the glory of God
I live for the glory of God
All to bring glory to God
Oh what a wonderful feeling it is
To know He is mine and to know I am His
Tell about His glory
And His redemption story
All to bring the glory to God
All to the glory of God
All to the glory of God
I live for the glory of God
All to bring glory to God
All to the glory of God
All to the glory of God
I live for the glory of God
All to bring glory to God
All to bring glory to God
Oh, my God
(All to bring glory to God)
It's all to bring glory to God
Everything I do
(All to bring glory to God)
And I live to bring glory to...
To God, to God, to God
(I live to bring glory to God)
In Him I live, and I move
And I have my being
(I live to bring glory to God)
I live so that Christ can be seen in me
(I live so that Christ can be seen in me)
I live so that Christ can be seen in me
(I live so that Christ can be seen in me)
I live so that Christ can be seen in everything I do and I say
(I live so that Christ can be seen in me)
Oh, my Lord
It's all to the glory of God
All to the glory of God
I live for the glory of God
All to bring glory to God
That's why I live
That's why I live
(All to bring glory to God)
And it's all to bring glory to God
All glory to God
