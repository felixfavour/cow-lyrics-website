You're my refuge when I'm weary
You are the shelter for my soul
You are the healer when I'm broken
Grace that makes me whole
Son of my salvation
Rescue of my heart
I believe your everything you say you are

I believe in the name of Jesus
My hope is in the name above all names
If the every other throne
I will trust in you alone
In the power of the only name that saves

Jesus
Jesus

You restore what has been taken
Redeem what has been lost
What was stolen in the garden
Has been paid for at the cross(Thank you Jesus, oh thank you)
Love says it is finished
Grace says I am free
The empty grave declares the joy of my victory

I believe in the name of Jesus
My hope is in the name above all names
If the every other throne
I will trust in you alone
In the power of the only name that saves

Jesus(sing that name)
Jesus(mighty God)
Mighty God
Glorious
Conqueror
My defender
Powerful
Victorious
No greater name(mighty God)
Mighty God
Glorious
Conqueror
My defender
Powerful
Victorious

No greater name
There is power
In the name of Jesus
There is power
In the name of Jesus
There is power
In the name of Jesus(I mean he came to break)
To break every chain
Break every chain
Break every chain
To break every chain
Break every chain
Break every chain
There is power
In the name of Jesus
There is power
In the name of Jesus
There is power
In the name of Jesus
To break every chain
Break every chain
Break every chain
To break every chain
Break every chain
Break every chain
I believe
In the name
Of Jesus
My hope is in the name above all names
If the every other throne
I will trust in you alone
In the power of the only name that saves
Jesus
Jesus
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
There is power
In the name of Jesus
There is power
In the name of Jesus
There is power
In the name of Jesus
To break every chain
Break every chain
Break every chain
To break every chain
Break every chain
Break every chain
