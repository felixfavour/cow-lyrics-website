I really love You, I love You right now
I really love You, I love You right now
I really love You, I love You right now
I really love You, I love You right now
Pour yourself out for our Savior, our friend
'Cause we really love You, we love You right now
And this is all about You, and we love You right now
And this is not religion, oh as some would suppose
This is a love song, with every fiber of my being I compose
'Cause I really love You, my strength and shield
I love You right now, my victory and my strength
Oh, I really love You, yeah, and I love You right now
I really You and I love You right now
'Cause I really love You, I love You right now
[Interlude]
You're my victory Jesus, oh
You're my everything, You're my everything
And I love You right now
[Outro]
You are my everything, and I love You right now
You are my everything, and I love You right now
