Praise and thanks unto you lord ,
For all the things that you have done
I'm grateful for your love,
I give you the praise
It is coming from my heart,
Praise and thanks unto you lord ,
For all the things that you have done
I'm grateful for your love,

When I thought that he had done too much oh,
Jesus did it again..
I'm counting my blessings
