All of creation singing the song of oldest age
Echoing heaven we join the angels as they sing
We join the angels and we sing
Holy holy
Holy is the Lord our God
Worthy worthy
Jesus Christ the saving One
Oh praise His name
Forever and ever amen
(Oh praise His name)
Behold the Savior
Scars of redemption on His hands
Bow down before Him
Come let us adore the Great I Am
Join in the song that never ends
Holy holy
Holy is the Lord our God
Worthy worthy
Jesus Christ the saving One
Oh praise His name
Forever and ever amen
(Oh praise His name)
