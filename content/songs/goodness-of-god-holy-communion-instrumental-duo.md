I love You, Lord
Oh, Your mercy never fails me
All my days
I've been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
All my life, You have been faithful
All my life, You have been so so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
I love Your voice
You have led me through the fire
In my darkest night
You were close like no other
I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend
And I have lived in the goodness of God, yeah
All my life, You have been faithful
All my life, You have been so so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God, yeah
