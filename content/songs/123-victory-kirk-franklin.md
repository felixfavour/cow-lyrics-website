[Chorus]
Hey Yo 1, 2 3 Get up we got Victory
No weapon they throw at me
You know it won't prosper, no
Just got laid off (I'm doing good)
House ain't even paid off (I'm doing good)
Should be afraid but (I'm feeling good)
All the time you say (God is good)
[Pre-Chorus]
You can calm down, down down
Don't forget who's in control
Walls are falling down down down
Get ready for the new Jericho
You waiting on God he's waiting on you
(so what you gon' do)
[Chorus](Repeat 2X)
Storms raging (I'm doing good)
See the world changing (I'm doing good)
I know it's not easy But life can't defeat me (God is good)
