It's the mystery
Of this hope in me
How You hold the stars
Yet You hold my heart
One who's first and last
Wiped away my past
Perfect royalty
Made His home in me
To the One who holds the stars
We lift You higher, we lift You higher
To the One who holds our hearts
There is no other
There is no other like You
King of endless life
Yet You chose to die
On a sinner's tree
Exposed for me
With one final breath
It is finished
Stormed the gates of hell
Ripping through the veil
To the One who overcame
We lift You higher, we lift You higher
To the Name above all Names
There is no other
There is no other
To the One who overcame
We lift You higher, we lift You higher
To the Name above all Names
There is no other
There is no other like You
There is no other like You
Jesus Christ
We magnify Your life
For Your majesty
We crown You King of kings (Yes, we do)
Jesus Christ
We magnify Your life
For Your majesty
We crown You King of kings
Jesus Christ
We magnify Your life
For Your majesty
We crown You King of kings
And Jesus Christ
We magnify Your life
For Your majesty
We crown You King of kings
Oh-oh-oh...
To the One who overcame
We lift You higher, we lift You higher
To the Name above all Names
There is no other
There is no other
To the One who overcame
We lift You higher, we lift You higher
To the Name above all Names
There is no other
There is no other like You
Oh-oh-oh...
Jesus Christ
Our perfect sacrifice
You are beautiful
Our hope's in You alone
Jesus Christ
Our perfect sacrifice
You are beautiful
Our hope's in You alone
Jesus Christ
Our perfect sacrifice (Thank You, Jesus)
You are beautiful
Our hope's in You alone
Jesus Christ
Our perfect sacrifice
You are beautiful
Our hope's in You alone
Jesus Christ
Our perfect sacrifice (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You are beautiful
Our hope's in You alone
Oh-oh-oh...
(To the one)
To the One who overcame
We lift You higher, we lift You higher
To the Name above all Names
There is no other
There is no other
To the One who overcame
We lift You higher, we lift You higher
To the Name above all Names
There is no other
There is no other like You
Oh, there is no other like You
Oh, no other like You
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
You're the One who overcame
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
