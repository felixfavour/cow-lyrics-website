Behold the Author of our salvation
Behold the wonder of grace so free
Behold the blessing of true forgiveness at Calvary
Behold the answer for all the broken
Behold the mercy that makes a way
Behold the promise of perfect healing
At Calvary
Come and see come and see what God has done
Come and see come and see what love has won
In this place hearts and lives waking up
To the Light of the world
You're the Light of the world
Your cross is speaking words of freedom
No condemnation shall we now fear
Our shame is silenced
Your love has triumphed at Calvary
Come and see come and see what God has done
Come and see come and see what love has won
In this place hearts and lives waking up
To the Light of the world
You're the Light of the world
