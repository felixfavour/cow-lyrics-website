(If not because of the Help of the Almighty)
Ai dago be da nisa
Ama ya bada Nasara
Verse 1
As where standing here, it's a testimony
Despite the winds and stormy waves, we are still here
Ama ya bada Nasara
The mountains that Jesus has moved is not just a story
(But He gave us Victory)
It is a proof of victory, the answer to prayer
We did not deserve a dime, but He gave us His all
We did not deserve a drop, but He gave us an ocean.
We don't deserve His breath of life but He gave us His mighty wind
Chorus
Mba domin Ubangiji Ya tai ma'ke mu,
(If not because of the Help of the Almighty)
Ai dago be da nisa
Ama ya bada Nasara
(But He gave us Victory)
Mba domin Ubangiji Ya tai ma'ke mu,
(If not because of the Help of the Almighty)
Ai dago be da nisa
Ama ya bada Nasara
(But He gave us Victory)
Verse 2
We live to see another day its not by our power
We did not deserve a day, but He gave us eternity
Because the name of Jesus Christ is our strong tower
It is the answer for a peaceful united nation
The mighty love of Jesus Christ our inspiration
His power is not limited by our circumstances
His promises are far above our situation
His light can never be subdued by the deepest darkness
His presence in our lives has made all the difference
Ai dago be da nisa
Ama ya bada Nasara
(But He gave us Victory)
Mba domin Ubangiji Ya tai ma'ke mu,
(If not because of the Help of the Almighty)
Ai dago be da nisa
Mba domin Ubangiji Ya tai ma'ke mu,
(Tomorrow would've been too late)
(But He gave us Victory)
Haaa haaa ha haaa
Mu samu Nasara
Haa haa ha haa
(We've got the victory)
Haa haa ha haa
(If not because of the Help of the Almighty)
(We've got the victory)
(We've got the victory)
Na naa naa 2ce
(We've got the victory)
Na naa naa 2ce
Mu samu Nasara
(We've got the victory)
Haa haa ha haa
Na naa naa 2ce
Mu samu Nasara
(We've got the victory)
Na naa naa 2ce
Mu samu Nasara
Chorus
(If not because of the Help of the Almighty)
(Tomorrow would've been too late)
Mu samu Nasara
Ama ya bada Nasara
(If not because of the Help of the Almighty)
(Tomorrow would've been too late)
(But He gave us Victory)
Ai dago be da nisa
(Tomorrow would've been too late)
Ama ya bada Nasara
(But He gave us Victory)
Ai dago be da nisa
(But He gave us Victory)
