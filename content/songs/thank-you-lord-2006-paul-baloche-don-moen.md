[Intro]
Here we go now
I come before You today
And there's just one thing that I want to say
Thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord
For all You've given to me
For all the blessings that I cannot see
Thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord
[Pre-Chorus]
With a grateful heart
With a song of praise
With an outstretched arm
I'll bless Your name
And thank You, Lord
I just want to thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord
I just want to thank You, Lord, yeah
For all You've done in my life
You took my darkness and gave me Your light
Thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord
You took my sin and my shame
You took my sickness and healed all my pain
Thank You, Lord
Thank You, Lord
