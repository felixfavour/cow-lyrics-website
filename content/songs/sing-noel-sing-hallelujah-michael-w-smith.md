This is a song i learned at my school and im just
Letting u know we adore it and its just beautiful for people to
Hear and sing it
Come, behold this child in a manger
Gift of the father's great love
Angels look down as His glory sorrounds them
Starlight from Heaven above
Sing Noel,Sing Hallelujah
God in us now come to dwell
Sing Noel lift high His praises
Christ our Emmanuel
Christ our Emmanuel
Let every daughter and son of the Father
Rise on this Christmas night
Let every voice sing all praise and rejoicing
Christ our redeemer is born
