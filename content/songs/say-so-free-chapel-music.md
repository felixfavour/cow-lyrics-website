What does it mean to be saved
Isn't it more than just a prayer to pray
More than just a way to heaven
What does it mean to be His
To be formed in His likeness
Know that we have a purpose
[Pre-Chorus]
To be salt and light in the world in the world
To be salt and light in the world
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so
Say so say so (say so)
Oh that the church would arise
Oh that we would see with Jesus' eyes
We could show the world heaven
Show what it means to be His
To be formed in His likeness
Show them they have a purpose
