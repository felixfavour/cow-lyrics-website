I've lived stories that have proved Your faithfulness
I've seen miracles my mind can't comprehend
And there is beauty in what I can't understand
Jesus, it's You, Jesus, it's You
I believe
You're the wonder-working God
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Too good to not believe, oh-oh
And I can't resurrect a man with my own hands
But just the mention of Your name can raise the dead, yeah
All the glory to the only One who can
Jesus, it's You, Jesus, it's You (c'mon)
Oh, I believe
You're the wonder-working God (yes, You are)
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
All the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not believe (too good)
Too good to not believe (c'mon)
Too good to not believe
After everything I've seen (after everything I've seen)
You're too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Too good to not believe (after everything I've seen You do)
(Oh, God)
Yes, I believe (I believe, I believe it)
Oh, I believe, ooh
We've seen cancer disappear
We've seen broken bodies healed
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
We've seen real life resurrection
We've seen mental health restored
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
We've seen families reunited
We've seen prodigals return (come home)
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it (don't you ever tell me)
We've seen troubled souls delivered
We've seen addicts finally freed (finally freed)
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
We'll see cities in revival
Salvation flood the streets (c'mon)
Don't you tell me He can't do it
Don't you tell me He can't do it
We'll see glory fill the nations
Like the world has never seen
Don't you tell me He can't do it
'Cause I know that He can
Yes, I believe (I believe)
You're the wonder-working God (oh, You are, You are, You are)
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe (too good, too good)
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
All the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Too good to not believe
Oh, never stop believing (oh, yes, I do)
We've seen so much (yes, I believe)
You're the same yesterday, today and forever
(Too good to not believe)
You can do anything Jesus
You can do anything (I believe, I believe, yeah)
Hallelujah, wonder-working God
Wonder-working God
Don't you ever stop believing
'Cause He's so, so good
So, so good
