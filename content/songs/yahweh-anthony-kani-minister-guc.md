Any disease You cannot heal
Is the there a mountain You cannot melt away
Any battle to hard for You?
Is there a name that is above Your name

CHORUS
You are
Yahweh! miracle working God

We call You Yahweh
There's nothing to hard for You

You are Yahweh
Ihe mmadu apughi ime ka I ne me (what no man can do, that's what You do)

Verse 2 (GUC)
I've been washed
Been Cleansed
Been Sanctified
Marked with the seal of Grace

In my flaws
My pain
You came alive
Gave me love undeserving
Forever
Any disease you cannot heal
Is there a mountain you cannot melt away
Any battle too hard for you
Is there a name that is above your name

Ibuchukwu
Odighi onye dika gi (You are God and there's none like You)
Nani gi oh (Only You)
Nani gi oh (Only You)
Onyewem (owner of my Life)
So gi bu onyewem (You are the owner of my life)
You are........

Vamp
You've never lost a battle Akogun l’oju ija (The Mighty Man at the battle front)
You speak and nation tremble, Yahweh Yahweh

CHORUS
Yahweh! miracle working God
Yahweh! There's nothing to hard for You
Yahweh! Ihe mmadu apughi ime ka I ne me (what no man can do, that's what You do)

Ka I n' eme ( that's what You do)
Ka I n' eme ( that's what You do)

Ihe mmadu apughi me ka I n' eme
