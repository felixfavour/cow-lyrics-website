Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Gloria
Glory to our Saviour
Gloria
Glory to our Saviour
Gloria
Glory to our Saviour
Gloria
Glory to our Saviour
Gloria
Glory to our new born King
We give you all the glory
We give you all the glory
We give you all the glory
Christ the Lord
We'll praise your name forever
We'll praise your name forever
We'll praise your name forever
Christ the Lord
