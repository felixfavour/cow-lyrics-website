(God i burn for you)
So come and consume me
My heart is ready
God if I burn, I'll burn for you
With no hesitation
Without reservations

Give me a fresh,fresh fire
Give me a fresh,fresh fire
I want what you desire
I gonna burn for you
Give me a fresh,fresh fire
Give me a fresh, fresh fire
I want what you desire
I gonna burn for you ( yeah)
Each breath that I'm breathing
Each moment I'm given
God if I live, I'll live for You
I love Your presence
You're my obsession
God if I live, I'll live for You
Oh, God if I live, I'll live for You

Give me a fresh, fresh fire

I want what You desire
I'm gonna burn for You
Give me a fresh, fresh fire
Give me a fresh, fresh fire
I want what You desire
I'm gonna burn for You
I wanna burn for You
For all the world to see
Holy Spirit come
Light a match
So, light a match, let it go
Set a blaze, uncontrolled
I want that fire
I want that fire
So, light a match, come on, and let it go
Set a blaze, uncontrolled
I want that fire (Send Your fire tonight, God)
I want that fire (So light a match)
So, light a match, let it go
Set a blaze, uncontrolled
I want that fire
I want that fire
So, light a match
So, light a match, let it go
Set a blaze, uncontrolled
I want that fire
(Come on, someone tell God I want that fire)
I want that fire
I want that fire (Want it burning in me)
I want that fire (Said I want the fire)
I want that fire (Want it burning in me)
I want that fire
Give me a fresh, fresh fire
Give me a fresh, fresh fire
I want it all
I want what You desire
(Gonna burn)

Set me ablaze
I want what You desire
I'm gonna burn for You
So, light a match, let it go
Set a blaze, uncontrolled
I want that fire
I want that fire
(Come ignite me)
So light a match, let it go
Set a blaze, uncontrolled
I want that fire
I want that fire
Fire that only You can breath
Fire that burns up everything but You
Come throw a couple logs on the fire
'Cause I wanna burn
Not just a spark, not just a flame
I wanna burn for You
'Cause a man on fire doesn't care what he
looks like
Doesn't care what he sounds like
A man on fire doesn't care what he looks like
Care what he sounds like
Care what he lives like
I wanna burn for You
I wanna burn for You
Oh, so set me ablaze
Set me on fire
I can't contain it
I can't contain it
Oh, set me ablaze
Set me on fire
Oh, sing "God, if I burn, I'll burn for You."
So God, if I burn, I'll burn for You (Oh, tell Him tonight)
God, if I burn, I'll burn for You (Only You, only You yeah)
So God, if I burn, I'll burn for You (You're my passion, You're my obsession)
God, if I burn, I'll burn for You (Oh, God, if I burn, I'll burn)
God, if I burn, I'll burn for You
God, if I burn, I'll burn for You (Give me a fresh fire)
Give me a fresh, fresh fire
Give me a fresh, fresh fire
I want what You desire
I'm gonna burn for You
Give me a fresh, fresh fire
Give me a fresh, fresh fire
I want what You desire
I'm gonna burn for You, God
