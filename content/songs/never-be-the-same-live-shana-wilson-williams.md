Today's my day
You changed my name
I might limp away
But I'll never be the same
[Chorus: Shana Wilson]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'll never be the same, never be the same
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'll never be the same, never be the same
Today's my day
You changed my name (Yeah)
I might limp away
But I'll never be the same
[Chorus: Tasha Cobbs-Leonard, 
Shana Wilson & Tasha Cobbs-Leonard
, 
Shana Wilson
]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'll never be the same, never bе the same
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I'll nevеr be the same, I'll 
never be the same
 
(Everybody lift that all over the building)
Today's my day (Today's my day, 
today's my day
)
You changed my name (You changed my name)
I might limp away (Oh, I might limp away)
But I'll never be the same (But guess what, I'll never be the same) (No no no)
