Jesus, lover of my soul
Jesus, I will never let You go
You've taken me from the miry clay
You've set my feet upon the rock
And now I know
I love you (I love you)
I need you (I need you)
Though my world may fall (though my world may fall)
I'll never let You go
My Savior (my Savior)
My closest Friend
I will worship You (I will worship You until the very end)
Sing it, Jesus (Jesus, You're lover of my soul)
Sweet Jesus (Jesus, I will never let You go)
And You've taken me (You've taken me from the miry clay)
You've set my feet upon the rock
And now I know
I love you (I love you)
And I need you (I need you)
Though my world may fall (though my world may fall)
I'll never let You go
No, no
My Savior,
My closest Friend
My closest Friend
I will worship You until the very end
Jesus, lover of my soul
Jesus, (Lord) I will never let You go
And You've taken me
You've taken me from the miry clay
Yes, You have
You've set my feet upon the rock (and now I know)
And now I know
I love you (I love you)
I need you (I need you)
Though my world may fall I'll never let You go
Never, never let You go, no
My Savior
My closest Friend
My closest Friend (I will worship You)
I will worship You until the very end
Oh
I love You
Oh, we need You
I need you (though my world may fall)
Though my world may fall
I'll never let You go
Never, never, never, never let You go
My Savior
My closest Friend (I will worship You)
I will worship You until the very end
