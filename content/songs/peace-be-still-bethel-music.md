[Instrumental]
I don't want to be afraid
Every time I face the waves
I don't want to be afraid
I don't want to be afraid
I don't want to fear the storm
Just because I hear it roar
I don't want to fear the storm
I don't want to fear the storm
Oh, peace be still
Say the word and I will
Set my feet upon the sea
Till I'm dancing in the deep
Oh, peace be still
You are here so it is well
Even when my eyes can't see
I will trust the voice that speaks
I'm not gonna be afraid
'Cause these waves are only waves
Oh, I'm not gonna be afraid
No, I'm not gonna be afraid
Oh, I'm not gonna fear the storm
You are greater than its roar
Oh, I'm not gonna fear the storm
No, I'm not gonna fear at all, yeah
