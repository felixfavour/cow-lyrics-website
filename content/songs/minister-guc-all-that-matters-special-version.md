so I'd put you in front
in front of my melody
you are all that matters
(do you mean what you are singing)
you are all that matters
I'd make room for..
I'd make room for two
(let me see your hands like this) two
you and I Jesus
you are all that matters
you are all that matters
and what would I live for
if I don't have you on my life
what would I gain if you take the holy ghost
(every body shout it)
what would have been come of me if I didn't see your light...
And what would have been said of me if you didn't hold my hand
(now I have come to realize)
Now have come to realize that you are all I have
ey ey eyy ey you are all that matters
ey ey ey ey ey  eyyy you are all that matters owei eyy
owei owei you are all that matters
owei eyyy owei owei you are all that matters
owei eyyy owei owei you are all that matters
owei owei you are all that matters
owei eyy owei owei you are all that matters
owei owei you are All that matters
Is it the house or is it the car
I'd give them all to you
it is the name or is it the fame
I'm nothing without you lord
(what would have)
what would have become of me if I didn't see your light
what would have been said of me if you didn't hold my hands
(now ooo..)
now I have come to realize
that you are all I have
you are all that matters
you are all that matters
(help me to make room for only two ... just you and I Jesus you are all that make sense to me)
you are all that matters
(let Me tell you something
philosophy would fade away
biology would fade away
physics would fade away
only Jesus would stand true)
( if Jesus is by your side
forget about what men say
he is all that matters)
you are all that matters
(just like my boss was saying
during you could not drive your car
infact you were home sick because you were just in the house alone
you could not go to work you could not busy any bodies call because you were busy
you see that nothing else matters again so the things we are chasing after cannot be compared to what Jesus gives
the platforms we are chasing after cannot be compared to what only Jesus can give...
he truly is all that makes sense
the bible says heaven and earth would pass away all the things we are boasting about all the things we brag about would pass aways
he is the only one that stands)
you are all that matters Jesus
(and when your work has been trialed with fire
what would stand
it's the assurance of Jesus in you that stands
when that situation trials you
for ten years you have not given birth
twenty years with that issue
it's the hope of glory in Christ Jesus that keeps you
