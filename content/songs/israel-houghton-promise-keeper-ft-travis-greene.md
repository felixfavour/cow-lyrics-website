Promise Keeper, You will never fail
Your love is true
Promise Keeper, You deliver
On Your word
And I will trust You
You never lie, You never lie
You see my need, You hear my cry
You never fail, You never fail
You never have, You never will
O-o-ooh
Your word remains forever
Promise Keeper, You will never fail
Your love is true
Promise Keeper, You deliver
On Your word
And I will trust You
You never sleep, You never sleep
You keep Your hand and Your eye on me
You always will, You always will
You're faithful now, You were faithful then
O-oh
Your word remains forever
Forever and ever (and ever)
Promise Keeper, You will never fail
Your love is true
Promise Keeper, You deliver
On Your word
And I will trust You
What lies behind me, I will forget
I'm pressing into, what lies ahead
Never let go, Your promises
You will deliver, just like You said
What lies behind me, I will forget
I'm pressing into, what lies ahead
Never let go, Your promises
You will deliver, just like You said
What lies behind me, I will forget
I'm pressing into, what lies ahead
Never let go, Your promises
You will deliver, just like You said
Promise Keeper
Promise Keeper
Promise Keeper
Promise Keeper
Promise Keeper
Promise Keeper
Promise Keeper
Promise Keeper, You deliver
On Your word
And I will trust You
I will trust You
