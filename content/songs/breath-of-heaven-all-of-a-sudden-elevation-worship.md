I have traveled many moonless nights
Cold and weary with a babe inside
And I wonder what I've done
Holy Father You have come
And chosen me now to carry Your Son
I am waiting in a silent prayer
I am frightened by the load I bear
In a world as cold as stone
Must I walk this path alone
Be with me now
Be with me now
Breath of heaven
Hold me together
Be forever near me
Breath of heaven
Breath of hеaven
Lighten my darkness
Pour ovеr me Your holiness
For You are holy
Breath of heaven
Do You wonder as You watch my face
If a wiser one should have had my place
But I offer all I am
For the mercy of Your plan
Oh help me be strong
Help me be
Help me
