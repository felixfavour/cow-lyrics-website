The splendor of a King
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice
He wraps himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
It trembles at his voice
Trembles at his voice
How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see
How great
How great is our God
And age to age He stands
And time is in His Hands
Beginning and the End
Beginning and the End
The Godhead, three in one
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb
How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see
How great
How great is our God
