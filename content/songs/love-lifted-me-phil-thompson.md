Glory, glory to God in the highest
Glory, glory to God
When nothing else could help
You came and rescued me
Your love lifted me
Your love lifted me
Your love lifted me
I am free to sing of Your love

Your love lifted me
Your love lifted me
Your love lifted me
I am free to sing of Your love
Your love lifted mе
Your love lifted me
Your lovе lifted me
I am free to sing of Your love
