What would the King of all want with this broken heart?
Why would He take the fall knowing us as we are?
Glory beyond the shame, healing beneath the scars
Nothing remains the same, now that we've seen Your love
Great is Your love
Nothing is greater than Your love
Great is Your love
Nothing is greater than Your love
No matter where I run, there I will find Your grace
Mercy has made us one, never to separate
Power beyond the grave, freedom beneath the cross
Oh, nothing remains the same, now that we've seen Your love
Great is Your love
Nothing is greater than Your love
Great is Your love
Nothing is greater than Your love
Great is Your love
Nothing is greater than Your love
Great is Your love
Nothing is greater than Your love
