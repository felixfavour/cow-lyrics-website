Let he who thinks he stands,
Let him take heed lest he falls
Even if he thinks he's right
Lord I surrender my all.
I cant do this on my own Watchfulness is not enough
I know I'm not qualified but,
Lord I surrender my all.
I surrender, I surrender, to You, To you (Take over, Take over me)
Instead of living and struggling Falling down and tumbling Take away all the suffering
Lord I surrender my all
Give me speed when run
Give me strength when I climb
 Give me life so I can fly
Lord I surrender my all
