If I'm really honest
Let me tell it like it is
I've been holding on to things
I never should
I forgot the promise
That if I trust in Him
It will work out
For my good
I surrender
I surrender
I surrender
All to You
Right here in this moment
I'm giving You control
LCause I find freedom
In letting go
I'm letting go
You are more than able
Fully faithful
You are big enough
You are strong enough
