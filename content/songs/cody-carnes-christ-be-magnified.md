Were creation suddenly Articulate
With a thousand Tongues to lift one cry
Then from North to South
And East to West
We'd hear Christ be Magnified
Were the whole Earth
Echoing His Eminence
His name would
Burst from sea and Sky
From Rivers to the Mountain tops
We'd hear Christ be Magnified
Oh Christ be Magnified
Let His Praise Arise
Christ be Magnified in me
Oh Christ be Magnified
From the Altar of my Life
Christ be Magnified in me
When every creature
Finds its inmost melody
And every human heart its native cry
Oh then in one
Enraptured hymn of praise
We'll sing Christ be Magnified
(O be lifted high, Jesus)
Oh Christ be Magnified
Let His Praise Arise
Christ be Magnified in me
Oh Christ be Magnified
From the Altar of my Life
Christ be Magnified in me
[Christ Be Magnified  by Cody Carnes]
I won't bow to idols
I'll stand strong and worship You
If it puts me in the Fire
I'll rejoice cause You're there too
I won't be formed by Feelings
I hold fast to what is True
If the cross brings Transformation
Then I'll be Crucified with You
Cus Death is just the doorway
Into Resurrection Life
If I join You in Your Sufferings
Then I'll join You when You Rise
And when You return in Glory
With all the Angels and the Saints
My Heart will still be Singing
And my Song will be the same
{ Oh Christ be Magnified
Let His Praise Arise
Christ be Magnified in me
Oh Christ be Magnified
From the Altar of my Life
Christ be Magnified in me } [ x2 ]
