You stood outside my grave
With tears still on Your face
I heard You say my name
My night was turned to day
'Cause You came
Oh, I knew that You would come
And You sang
And my heart it woke up
Now I'm not afraid, I see Your face
I am alive
'Cause You came
Oh, I knew that You would come
And You said death's only sleeping
With one word my heart was beating
And I rose up from my grave
And my fear was turned to faith
'Cause You came
Oh, I knew that You would come
And You sang
And my heart it woke up
Now I'm not afraid, I see Your face
I am alive
'Cause You came
Oh, I knew that You would come
