[Refrain]
Hold me in Your arms, never let me go
I want to spend eternity with You
I stand before You Lord and give You all my praise
Your love is all I need
Jesus, You're all I need
My life belongs to You, You gave Your life for me
Your grace is all I need
Jesus, You're all I need
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me in Your arms, never let me go
I want to spend eternity with You
And now that You're near
Everything is different, everything's so different, Lord
I know I'm not the same, my life You've changed
I wanna be with You, I wanna be with You
I stand before You Lord and give You all my praise
Your love is all I need
Jesus, You're all I need
My life belongs to You, You gave Your life for me
Your grace is all I need
Jesus, You're all I need
