And you will see the goodness
You will see the goodness of the Lord
You will see the goodness
You will see the goodness of the Lord
While you live
You’ve waited patiently
And wondered when will it be
He may not come when you want Him
But He’s always on time
And You will see the goodness
Make a declaration in this room
You will see the goodness of the Lord
While you live
(While you live)
Donnie McClurkin
You cried and you prayed
(You cried and you prayed) my God
Prayed and cried
(Prayеd and cried)
And it seems as if it wasn’t enough
(Ooooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Ooooh, oooh, oooh, oooh)
Oh my, oh my
