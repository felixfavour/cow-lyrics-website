"Speak To My Heart" lyrics
Donnie McClurkin Lyrics
"Speak To My Heart"
Keep on talkin' to me, keep on talkin' to me
Keep on talkin' to me, keep on talkin' to me
Keep on talkin' to me, keep on talkin' to me
Keep on talkin' to me
Speak to my heart, Holy Spirit
Give me the words that will bring new life
Words on the wings of the morning, the dark night will fade away
If You speak to my heart now
Speak to my heart, Holy Spirit
Message of love, love to encourage me
Lifting my heart from despair, how You love, love me, and care for me
Speak to my heart now, oh Lord
Speak to my heart, Holy Spirit
Give me the words that will bring new life
Words on the wings of the morning, the dark nights will fade away
Speak to my heart
Speak to my heart, Holy Spirit
Message of love to encourage me
Lifting my heart from despair, how You love me and care for me
Speak to my heart
Speak to my heart, that's what I want You to do
Speak to my heart, 'cause I'm waiting to hear from You
Speak to my heart, that's what I want You to do
Speak to my heart
Speak to my heart, Lord, give me Your holy word
If I can hear from You, then I'll know what to do
I won't go alone, I'll never go on my own
Just let Your spirit guide and let Your word abide, say
Speak to my heart, Lord, give me Your holy word
If I can hear from You, then I'll know what to do
I won't go alone, Lord, I'll never go on my own
Just let Your spirit guide and let Your word abide
Speak to my heart, Lord, give me your holy word
If I can hear from You, then I'll know what to do
I won't go alone, I'll never go on my own
Just let Your spirit guide and let Your word abide
Speak to my heart, Lord, give me Your holy word
If I can hear from You, then I'll know what to do
I won't go alone, I'll never go on my own
Just let Your spirit guide and let Your word abide
Speak to my heart, Lord, give me Your holy word
If I can hear from You, then I'll know what to do
I won't go alone, I'll never go on my own
Just let Your spirit guide and let Your word abide
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, yeah, yeah
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, talk
Keep on talkin' to me, keep on talkin' to me, yeah, yeah
Keep on talkin' to me, talk to me, talk
