Your singing moves and shakes the ground
Your beckon brings the rain in drought
Your glory spins the earth around
And Your whisper makes Your fire fall down
[Pre-Chorus]
There's no other name
The Name that stands through the ages
There's no other name
There's no other name like Yours, Jesus
Like Yours, Jesus
There's no other name
There's no other name like Yours, Jesus
Like Yours, Jesus
Your word commands the wind and waves
Your touch revives the sick and lame
Your power wakes the dead again
And Your love destroys the grip of sin
For Your love destroys the grip of sin
There's no other name
There's no other name like Yours, Jesus
Like Yours, Jesus
There's no other name
There's no other name like Yours, Jesus
Like Yours, Jesus
There's no other name
There's no other name like Yours, Jesus
Like Yours, Jesus
There's no other name
There's no other name like Yours, Jesus
Like Yours, Jesus
