[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Man, I wanna tell y'all something, man
Man, I'm not gon' let these material things get in my way, y'all
I'm tryna get somewhere
I'm tryna get somewhere that's real and pure and true and eternal
Toby, can you go witcha boy?
Let's go
Father God, I am clay in your hands
Help me to stay that way through all life's demands
Cause they chip, and they nag, and they pull at me
And every little thing I make up my mind to be
Like I'ma be a daddy who's in the mix
And I'ma be a husband who stays legit
And I pray that I'm an artist who rises above
The road that is wide and filled with self-love
Everything that I see draws me
Though it's only in You that I can truly see
That it's a feast for the eyes, a low blow to purpose
And I'm a little kid at a three-ring circus
[Chorus: TobyMac]
I don't wanna gain the whole world
And lose my soul
(Don't wanna walk away)
(Let me hear the people say)
