Are you past the point of weary
Is there a broader way in heaven
Is it all toouch to carry
Let me tell about my Jesus
Do you feel that empty feeling
Christians and all its feeling
And your desperate for some meaning
Chorus
Let me tell you about my Jesus oooo
He makes a way where there ain't no way
Rises up from an empty grave
Ain't no sinner that he can't save
Let me tell you about my Jesus
His love is strong and His grace is free
And the Good news is i know that He can do you for you what He's done for me
Let  tell you about my Jesus
And let my Jesus change your life
Halleujah Halleujah Halleujah
Amen Amen Amen
