I'm not forsaken, Never alone
The God of Heaven
Calls me His own
He's not just seated
upon the throne
I know He's right here
inside my home.
I've got a treasure
Here in my heart
And in my weakness
It won't depart
I have a Savior who will abide
He's not just with me,
He Lives inside.
 
Just go ask Daniel if
our God will bring you out
And he will testify
He shuts the Lion's mouth
Go ask those Hebrew boys
if He'll stick by your side
They will identify
the fourth man in the fire
(they'll tell you).
 
Oh, Oh, Oh, Ooh, Oh
He's in the Room
Oh, Oh, Oh, Ooh, Oh
He's in the Room.

Oh, Oh, Oh, Ooh, Oh
He's in the Room
Oh, Oh, Oh, Ooh, Oh
He's in the Room.
If I search the heavens high
He's there
If I search the earth below
He's there
If I make my bed in hell
He's there
No matter where I go
He's there.
 
Where can I run from His Spirit
He's there
Where can I go from His presence
He's there
Even in the deepest depths
He's there
No matter where I go
He's there.
 
I'm never alone
He'll never forsake me
I'll stay in His arms
Right here in His safety.
 
I'm never alone
He'll never forsake me
I'll stay in His arms
Right here in His safety
