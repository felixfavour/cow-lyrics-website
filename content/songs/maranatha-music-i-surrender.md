here I am down on my knees again to render honor
find me here Lord as you draw me near, desperate for you
I surrender
INSTRUMENTAL
with arm stretched out I know you hear my cry,speak to me now
I surrender,I surrender,I want to know you more
I surrender,I surrender,I want to know you more
I surrender,I surrender,I want to know you you more
like a mighty storm
