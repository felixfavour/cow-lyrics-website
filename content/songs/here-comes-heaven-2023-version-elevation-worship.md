Children weep no more
Hope is on the horizon
Weary world behold
Your promised Messiah
Angels let your song begin
Here comes heaven
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Here comes heaven
Sinner wait no more
Love has broken the silence
Come let us adore
The Savior is with us
Now behold his glory
Glory in the highest
All the earth rejoice for Christ is born
Now behold his glory
Glory in the highest
All the earth rejoice for Christ is born
Over all who mourn
Breaks the dawn of salvation
Darkness reigns no more
For Jesus is greater
