Joy of my days
You are my strength
Here I am sheltered in your hand
Light of the dawn
Power of the sea
Deep in your heart you carry me
Song of my heart
Breath of my soul
You are my reason and my all
Lord of the earth
Fire of the skies
Jesus my life is where you are
May our worship be your throne
For the praise of your glory forever
In this holy place let your will be done
May your praise be lifted up
Let us join with the praises of heaven
To the ends of the earth
Let your kingdom come
