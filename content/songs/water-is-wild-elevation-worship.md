Oh, this is the day of salvation, what a time to be alive
Stop looking for the evidence, and start living in the promises
And this is the year of His favor, this is the rain that we prayed for
Start living in the promises, like You know who your Father is
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Heaven's tearing open, tearing open wide
Oh, I feel it down on the inside, yeah
Heaven's tearing open, tearing open wide
I feel it down on the inside, I feel it down on the inside, oh
(Down on the inside)
We are a chosen generation baptized with tongues of fire
Believe in the promises, we're gonna see what the prophet said
It's more than a visitation 'cause we are the House of God
Start living in the promises like You know who your Father is
[Chorus: Brandon Lake & Chris Brown]
Heaven's tearing open, tearing open wide
I feel it down on the inside, I feel it down on the inside
Heaven's tearing open, tearing open wide
I feel it down on the inside, I feel it down on the inside, yeah
Down on the inside (Down on the inside)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
