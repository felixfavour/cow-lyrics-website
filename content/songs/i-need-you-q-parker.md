[Intro]
[?]
on the beat
Ooh
You might see me and you may think I'm doing fine
Ha, what you don't see is what I'm keeping behind this round (Oh)
Take a second as a question, you just might find you
That thing you've been strong and weird (What I've been dealing with at the same time)
[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know me, so you can't trust me
Yeah, I get that, but we must be
Willing to find things at times together
Nothing's impossible, it's whatever
I need you
It's time we put our pride on the shelf
I need you
Don't let me fight this fight by myself, ooh
Enlightened where I'd rather when united [?] (Right, we can go)
I need you (I need you)
I need you
(You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you)
