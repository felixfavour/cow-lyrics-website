This Jesus
who carried our shame
This Jesus
who rose from the grave
The same Jesus
we worship today, we worship today
He came to us
In grace and in truth
He's still with us
And still on the move
The same Jesus
He's making us new, He's making us new
I know that my redeemer lives
I know that my redeemer lives
He's still keeping all His promises
The same Jesus, the same Jesus
oh   oh   oh   oh   oh   oh
He's commanding
The wind and the waves
His kingdom
Forever shall reign
And we know that
He's coming again, He's coming again
I know that my redeemer lives
I Know that my redeemer lives
He's still keeping all His promises
The same Jesus, the same Jesus
oh   oh   oh   oh   oh   oh
He's the first and the last
The beginning and end
At the sound of His cry
All the world came alive
And He formed us from dust
Put His breath in our lungs
We were made for His love
But we ran from the light
But He wouldn't give up
On His daughters and sons
So He took up the cross
And He laid down His life
Then He did what He said
When He rose from the dead
And He's coming back again
I know that my redeemer lives
I know that my redeemer lives
He's still keeping all His promises
The same Jesus, the same Jesus
I know that my redeemer lives
I know that my redeemer lives
He's still keeping all His promises
The same Jesus, the same Jesus
oh   oh   oh   oh   oh   oh
Forever the same
Forever the same
He's still keeping all His promises
The same Jesus, the same Jesus
