[Chorus]
O give thanks to the Lord
For His love endures
O give thanks to the Lord
For His love endures
O give thanks to the Lord
For His love endures
Forever, forever
The Lord is marching out in splendour
In awesome majesty He rides
For truth, humility and justice
His mighty army fills the skies
O give thanks to the Lord
For His love endures
O give thanks to the Lord
For His love endures
O give thanks to the Lord
For His love еndures
Forever, forеver
His army marches out with dancing
For He has filled our hearts with joy
Be glad the Kingdom is advancing
The love of God our battle cry
