Here I am, here You are
I give all of me for all of You, Lord
I don't want to move or leave
Unless You, unless You go with me
[Chorus: Leeland]
One thing I ask, one thing I seek
Show me Your glory
You're all I want, You're all I need, Jesus
Show me Your glory
You are good, good to me
With every step, I'll let Your Spirit lead
Valleys low or on mountain peaks
I'll follow You, 'cause I know You never leave
[Chorus: Brandon Lake and Leeland]
One thing I ask, one thing I seek
Show me Your glory
You're all I want, You're all I need, Jesus
Show me Your glory
[Bridge: Brandon Lake and Leeland]
How deep, how wide
Show me Your glory
My heart and flesh cry
Show me Your glory
How deep, how wide
Show me Your glory
'Cause my heart and flesh cry
Show me Your glory
