See the morning, see it rising
Over the mountains high
See the mercy in the mighty hand of God
Living Water come and fill us
Only You can satisfy
Turn our sorrow into singing
The song of life
Rejoice, Rejoice
Sing with the angel voices
Rejoice, Rejoice
All Heaven and earth rejoice
Lord, Your strength is a tower
The righteous run into
Lord, Your love is a banner over us
And we hold on to the promise
That Your hold on us is true
There's no other like You, Jesus
No one like You
[Outro]
Always
Again I say rejoice
