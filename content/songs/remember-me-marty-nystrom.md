On the night You were betrayed
You took the bread
After giving thanks
You broke it and said
This is My Body broken for you
And as you eat it, Remember Me
This is My Body broken for you
And as you eat it, Remember Me
On the night You were betrayed
You held the cup
After giving thanks
You lifted it up
This is my blood poured out for you
And as you drink it, Remember Me
This is my blood poured out for you
And as you drink it, Remember Me
So we thank you for
The wine and for the bread
For we see the life you gave
And the blood you shed
