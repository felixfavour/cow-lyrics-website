You're not a God created by human hands
You're not a God dependent on any mortal man
You're not a God in need of
Anything we can givE
By Your plan, that's just the way it is
(Chorus:)
You are God alone, from before time began
You were on Your throne, You are God alone
And right now, in the good times and bad
You are on Your throne, You are God alone
You're the only God whose power none can contend
You're the only whose name and
Praise will never end
You're the only God who's worthy
Of everything we can give
You are God, that's just the way it is
(Chorus)
You are God alone, from before time began
You were on Your throne, You are God alone
And right now, in the good times and bad
You are on Your throne, You are God alone
