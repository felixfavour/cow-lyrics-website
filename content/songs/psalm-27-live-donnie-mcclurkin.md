One thing have I desired up the Lord
And that one thing will I seek for
That I may dwell in His house
And inquire in His temple
And behold the beauty of the beautiful Savior
One thing that I desire from the Lord
That one thing will I seek for
That I may dwell within His house
And inquire in His temple
And behold the beauty of the Lord
Beautiful Savior, beautiful Savior
I am not worried and I am not dismayed
I never will run away, no, I won't
I won't fear the enemy
No, I won't, no no
When they come at me, they're gonna fall
Yes, for Your power will conquer all
There's just one place I wanna be Lord, [Incomprehensible]
That place is
One thing that I desire from the Lord
Yes, that one thing will I seek for
That I may dwell within His house
And inquire in His temple
And behold the beauty of the Lord
