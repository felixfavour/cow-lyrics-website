One Name
Holds weight above them all
His fame
Outlasts the earth He formed
His praise
Resounds beyond the stars
And echoes in our hearts
The greatest One of all
His face
Shines brighter than the sun
His grace
As boundless as His love
He reigns
With healing in His wings
The King above all kings
The greatest One of all
Lift up our eyes see the King has come
Light of the world reaching out for us
There is no other Name, there is no other Name
Jesus Christ our God
Seated on high the undefeated One
Mountains bow down as we lift Him up
There is no other Name, there is no other Name
Jesus Christ our God
