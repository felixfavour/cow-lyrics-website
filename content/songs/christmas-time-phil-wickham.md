A beautiful December night
Snow has turned this city white (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
This old town has gone to sleep
Save the church on 2nd Street (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
All the faithful now have come
To join and sing these Christmas songs
Let them ring, let them ring, sweet carols of a King
Coming down, coming down from His throne above the clouds
To bring us light, yeah, to save our lives, Christmas time
What a merry Christmas morning!
The Savior of the world is born (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
The God of all the universe
Is bringing light unto the earth! (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
[Pre-Chorus]
So everybody join and sing (Everybody join and sing)
Celebrate the newborn King
Let them ring, let them ring, sweet carols of a King
Coming down, coming down from His throne above the clouds
To bring us light, yeah, to save our lives, Christmas time
