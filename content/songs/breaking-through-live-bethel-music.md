You love is like a sunrise
Shattering the dark of night
Your presence is a paradise to our hearts
You’re filling all the world with light
You’re making every wrong thing right
You’re waking up the dead to life in Your love
In Your love, Your love, Your love
[Interlude]
You love is like a sunrise
Shattering the dark of night
Your presence is a paradise to our hearts
You’re filling all the world with light
You’re making every wrong thing right
You’re waking up the dead to life, yes, in Your love
God, You’re always breaking through the dark
Breaking into lives and healing hearts
Your love has torn the veil
Your love can never fail
Your love is making all things new
