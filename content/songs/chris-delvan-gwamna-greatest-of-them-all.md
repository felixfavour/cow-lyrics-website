Verse 1
I've sang songs all through my life,
Some I remember but some Have gone away
 
If I had to choose the greatest song of all,
It had to be the song i sang of You

Some I remember but some I love to forget
 
If I had to choose the greatest of them all
It must be when I was there with You

I've had dreams all the days of  my life, Many I remember but some I do forget
 
But if I had to choose the greatest dream of all,
I have to say it's to be the one with You

I've seen days in this great life,
Days to remember and days I wish to forget
