[Intro: 
Kirk Franklin
 & Luke James]
Oh, but I wish that I could get you to see
That if we love each other
If we're patient with each other
If we bring back the compassion with each other
Then we'll see the blessing
Get bigger and better and stronger and greater
Because we were created to be blessed
Everywhere we go it's a paradise
Looks like sunlight and blue skies ready to take off right (Hey)
This feel in this hotel room is my ride
These Versace sheets might as well be my clouds (Clouds)
Up here where I hear my thoughts out loud
[Pre-Chorus: Luke James]
Open spaces don't end, wow
And I won't miss life on the ground
Can't imagine not goin' nowhere
They don't want us to go
Oh, no-no
Oh, my golden brown skin is so rare (Wow)
Oh-oh
Feel the wind blowing through my good hair
Take me there
