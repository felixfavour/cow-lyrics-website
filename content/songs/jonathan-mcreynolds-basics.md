Jonathan McReynolds - Basics
To Rate
{Intro}
Yeah, oh
I-I-I-I, yah
Yah-yah-yah
Yeah, nah
Welcome to the camp
{Verse 1}
I've seen miracles
{and/in good ?}
And people leave with no doubts
Man, they different when they step out
Yeah, I've seen legs healed and arms stretched
Men's hearts refreshed
Lost girls leave kept
And after years witnessing all that
Who could think I could lose contact with You? (With You, with You)
So what do you do when it gets like that?
You strip it down and rebuild it back with truth, ooh
{Chorus}
So I can't believÐµ that I'm back to the basics
Climbin' out of the trees, gettin' back to thÐµ root (Ooh)
No, I can't believe that I'm back to the basics
Jumpin' down from the clouds, gettin' grounded in You
{Verse 2}
I've heard every song and Sunday word
The profound, the absurd
And I study 'cause I'm a nerd
I've heard that God's good and He's real
And the devil, he'll steal
Faith over what you feel, hey
And I promise I still believe all that
It's simple things that you must come back home to
Ain't complex with You, no, no
I can give my best, even give what's left
But I can't move mountains if I lose step with You, oh
{Chorus}
So I can't believe that I'm back to the basics
Climbin' out of the trees, gettin' back to the root, ooh
I can't believe that I'm back to the basics
Jumpin' down from the clouds, gettin' grounded in You
{Bridge}
So if you lose your way
Get back to the basics
Somebody needs to pray
Get back to the basics
God's love is still the same
Get back to the basics
Come back and find your faith
Get back to the basics
Yeah, His hand don't pull away
So, get back to the basics
You're not too far today
To get back to the basics
Mm, there's sun after the rain
Back to the basics
There's healing after pain
Back to the basics
{Outro}
La-la-la-la-la-la
Get back to the basics
La-la-la-la-la-la
Get back to the basics
La-la-la-la-la-la
Gettin' back to the basics
La-la-la-la-la-la
Get back to the basics, oh
