It was a good night I stayed on key
Me and the drummer were on the same beat
Had coordination in both my feet
Oh what a night!
I took off my guitar and I met you
Sweet little angel beneath the moon
The stars were shining and so were you
Then I saw the light
So I took your fingers to my face
And with the tips began to trace
The way that my eyes and my mouth were shaped
And you had your sight
For a moment that night
Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
What a delight
Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
I see you in the daylight
You're only seven and you taught me
Life is much more than what we see
Behind the veil of history
Til faith becomes sight
(Believing is seeing)
Cause there's so much beauty to behold
A world of wonder to unfold
Safe with a pure in the heart and soul
Who turn on the light
In the dark of the night
I talked to your mother the other day
And she told me you passed away
I could'ntfind the words to say
I started to cry
She said when the heart begins to ache
She can remember you in a place
Looking at Jesus face to face
Oh what a delight you got to sight
His hands in the light
You can see me tonight
Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
Yeah!
Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna
Yeah!
You can see me tonight
You can see me tonight
You can see me tongiht

Sure was a good night
It was a good night
Yeah!

Bye Bye Brianna
Bye Bye Brianna

I see you in the daylight
