How great is our God
Sing with me, How great is our God
All will see, How great
How great
Is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, How great is our God
All will see, How great
How great
Is our God
The splendor of a King
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
Let all the earth rejoice
He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
It trembles at His voice
It trembles at His voice
How great is our God
Sing with me, How great is our God
All will see, How great
How great
Is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, How great is our God
All will see, How great
How great
Is our God
Then sings my soul... My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
Then sings my soul... My Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art
How great Thou art
How great is our God
Sing with me, How great is our God
All will see, How great
How great
Is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, How great is our God
All will see, How great
How great
Is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, How great is our God
All will see, How great
How great
Is our God
How great is our God  (Nobody like Him, nobody like Him)
Sing with me, How great is our God  (He's worthy)
And all will see, How great
How great
Is our God
