Verse 1]
It’s soo Easy to forget
The Victories of the Past
And Focus on the Trials
Of the Moment
It’s soo Easy to Complain
Talk about the Pain
And Forget his Goodness
And his Mercies
But when I Look
Over my Shoulder, to see
How Far you’ve Brought me
It’s soo Clear you have
Been Faithful all Along
So I will not Hold Back
My Worship even through
The Raging Storms
I will Open up my Mouth
And give you Praise
I Remember, Remember
Your Goodness
I Remember, Remember your Love
I Remember, Remember
Your Faithfulness
I Remember, Remember
Your Grace
Nah, nah, nah  Nah, nah, nah
