They say this mountain can't be moved
They say these chains will never break
But they don't know You like we do
There is power in Your name
We've heard that there is no way through
We've heard the tide will never change
They haven't seen what You can do
There is power in Your name
So much power in Your name
Move the immovable
Break the unbreakable
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
We know that hope is never lost
For there is still an empty grave
God, we believe, no matter what
There is power in Your name
So much power in Your name
Move the immovable
Break the unbreakable
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
You are the way when there seems to be no way
We trust in You, God, You have the final say
You are the way when there seems to be no way
We trust in You, God, You have the final say
You are the way when there seems to be no way
We trust in You, God, You have the final say
Move the immovable
Break the unbreakable
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
Move the immovable
Break the unbreakable
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
You said it, I believe
You said it, it is done
You said it, I believe
You said it, it is done
You said it, I believe it
You said it, it is done
You said it, I believe it
You said it, it is done
You said it, I believe it
You said it, it is done
You said it, I believe it
You said it, it is done
You said it, I believe it
You said it, it is done
You said it, I believe it
You said it, it is done
You said it, I believe it
You said it, it is done
You said it, I believe it
You said it, it is done
Move the immovable
Break the unbreakable
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
From the impossible
We'll see a miracle
God, we believe
God, we believe for it
God, we believe for it
God, we believe for it
God, we believe for it
