I've been in the tunnel
Oh, you're the light at the end of it
I know I'm not mistaking
I know this reality over illusion
I been on it for so long
Could rinse and repeat it
Could get used used to this, till I'm all over, all over, over you
Oh you're my devotion
So let me love you
Like my life depends on it
Every hour, every second that I'm awake
So let me love you
Like we're writing history
Close your eyes
Let's go anywhere away from here
Let's go anywhere away from here
In the end say make we dey
Sun or rain
Joy or pain
In the end say make we dey
Sun or rain
Joy or pain
This feels like forever
I could swear by the moon and the stars we see
That there'll never come a time where we're no longer to be
You're the answer to my prayers
Till death do us part
Can you hold on to me
For a million years and for more than we could ever believe for.
So let me love you
Like my life depends on it
Every hour, every second that I'm awake
So let me love you
Like we're writing history
Close your eyes
Let's go anywhere away from here
Let's go anywhere away from here
In the end say make we dey
Sun or rain
Joy or pain
In the end say make we dey
Sun or rain
Joy or pain
So let me love you
Like my life depends on it
Every hour, every second that I'm awake
So let me love you
Like we're writing history
Close your eyes
Let's go anywhere away from here
Let's go anywhere away from here
