There is nothing like Your love
No exchange for all You gave
To be welcomed into life
So I can know the love that saves
Now forever to belong
To walk with You for all my days
Theres no greater love than this
You are the Author and the Way
Pre-Chorus:
This is the sound of the redeemed
Rising up to praise the King
Our hope is in You
This is the sound of the redeemed
Rising up to praise the King
Chorus:
Singing glorious glorious One You have saved us
Honor and Power and Praise to the Savior
You are the Answer You are the Answer
You come with power come with fire
As we lift Your name on high
And join with all the saints to sing
In bringing Honor to the King
