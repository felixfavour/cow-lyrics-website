We're gonna dance dance dance
In the freedom we know
We're gonna dance dance
In the freedom we know
We're gonna dance dance dance
In the freedom we know
Because the freedom we know is gonna last forever
The world turns in all of its ways
But I'm soul set on a holy name
And when all earth is said and done
Still I will praise Him
There's no end to the love that He gives
And now broken dreams have life again
In the hope of the risen king
Let us praise Him
A Mystery unthinkable
But He took the fall just to save my soul
Now the love is the life I know
And on and on and on
We'll be singing'
Soul set free in the one I love
Come on come on
And let the whole earth sing in the freedom we know
Come on come on and praise Him
