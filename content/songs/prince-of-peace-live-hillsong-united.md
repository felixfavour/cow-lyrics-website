My heart a storm
Clouds raging deep within
The Prince of Peace came bursting through the wind
The violent sky held its breath
And in Your light I found rest
[Bridge]
Tearing through the night
Riding on the storm
Staring down the fight
My eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun
Striding through my fear
The Prince of Peace met me there
You heard my prayer
Hope like the sun
Light piercing through the dark
The Prince of Peace came and broke into my heart
The violent cross, the empty grave
And in Your light I found grace
[Bridge]
Tearing through the night
Riding on the storm
Staring down the fight
My eyes found Yours
Shining like the sun
Striding through my fear
The Prince of Peace met me there
You were always there
And you heard my prayer
