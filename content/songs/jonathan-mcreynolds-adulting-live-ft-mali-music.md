I realized something
When I woke up this morning
What I'm overwhelmed by
Is exactly what I wanted
Adulting ain't easy
Even when you're happy
The work to maintain it
Can still make you crazy
And I'm not quite sure
What it's all quite for
Buy maybe
One day I'm gonna finally learn that somethings
Just ain't worth stressing about
I'm gonna pray and not doubt
That my God can work it out
Work it out, yeah
I take care of what I can
I'll leave the rest in his hands
Trust that God can work it out
Work it out, yeah
Yeah, these shoes I'm tryna fill up
It's enough to make me give up
I see them pointing
Don't want to disappoint them
Adulting's an honor
But so many problems
I bet if I list them
I could make an album
You know it's just like me to turn issues into an anthem
But one day I'm gonna finally write that somethings
Just ain't worth stressing about
I'm gonna pray and not doubt
That my God can work it out
Work it out, yeah
I take care of what I can
I'll leave the rest in His hands
And trust that God can work it out
Work it out, yeah
Nothing's impossible
But they can't stop us
Now I'm adulting in this purpose circus
You see we clean now
Was dirty south they see we mean now
Humbly flat face see we bow
Before the Father and the King of Kings
Heavenly Father you see everything
We just let the praises ring
McReynolds, the big window to pour a blessing out when I'm aching in the middle
Watch me pray a lot harder (All I can do is)
Listen to the spirit move smarter (All I can do is)
You make my heart I keep the guard up (All I can do is)
Ah yeah
Adulting ain't free, it's easy ain't breezy (Yeah)
Still, You're the God of (All I can do is)
Every situation, get the hard stuff (All I can do is)
You gave me life I give it all up (All I can do is)
Adulting ain't free, but easy believe me
It's in in your hand, you got the plan, we just being men
Read the book, take a look, but we don't understand
Now I ain't little but I might just need to grab a hand
I ain't ashamed to ask to guide my path back to the land
Adulting man it's nasty
Adulting just made me rethink when He told me
To come like a child
Maybe that was meant to save me
