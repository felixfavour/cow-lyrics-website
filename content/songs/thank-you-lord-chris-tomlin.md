Thank You Lord for the small things
Like me and her on the porch swing
For summer nights and fireflies
And the sound of my old six string
Blessings, on blessings, on blessings, on blessings
If I still got breath in these lungs
And that's all I need to get down on my knees
And be thankful for all that He's done
For my mama, for my friends
For Your love, it never ends
For the songs that make us dance
On this ol' dirt floor
For my babies, for my girl
For the way they changed my world
Waking up today
Yeah, I just gotta say, Thank You Lord
Yeah, I just wanna say, Thank You Lord, oh nah
Yeah
Thank You Lord for the hard times
For lighting the way in the dark times
For pulling me in, forgiving again
The times that I took it too far, I
Gotta thank You for keeping me humble
For picking me up when I stumble
And although I change, You stay the same
And I don't say thank You enough
