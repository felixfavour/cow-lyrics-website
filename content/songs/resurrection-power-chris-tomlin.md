You called me from the grave by name
You called me out of all my shame
I see the old has passed away
The new has come
Now I have resurrection power
Living on the inside
Jesus, You have given us freedom
No longer bound by sin and darkness
Living in the light of Your goodness
You have given us freedom
And I'm dressed in Your royalty
Your Holy Spirit lives in me
And I see my past has been redeemed
The new has come
Now I have resurrection power
Living on the inside
Jesus, You have given us freedom
I'm no longer bound by sin and darkness
Living in the light of Your goodness
You have given us freedom
