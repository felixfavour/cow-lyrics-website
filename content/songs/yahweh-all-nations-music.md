So we lift You high
It's Yahweh

So we lift You high
Yahweh, Yahweh
And we lift You high
It's Yahweh, Yahweh
And we lift You high
It's Yahweh, Yahweh
And we lift You high

You alone deserve my worship
You alone deserve my praise
And You alone deserve the honor

So we lift You high
Yahweh, Yahweh
We lift You high
Yahweh, Yahweh
We lift You high
Yahweh, Yahweh
We lift You high
Yahweh, Yahweh

You led us out of the wilderness
Of Your great Name
Out of the horrible place
By Your great Name
Great and mighty Deliverer
We lift thy Name

You're Adonai
Yahweh, Yahweh
You're Adonai, You are, You are
Yahweh, Yahweh
We lift You high
Yahweh, Yahweh
You've revealed yourself as I Am, I Am
We lift You high
Yahweh, Yahweh

Yeah, you reign on high Your name
Yahweh, Yahweh
And there's none beside
Yahweh, Yahweh
Angels bow before You
Heaven and Earth adore You
Yahweh, Yahweh 
We lift You
We lift You high
Yahweh, Yahweh

We lift You high
We lift You high
We lift You high
As we lift You high
As we lift You high

We lift You high
Yahweh, Yahweh
We lift You high
Yahweh, Yahweh
We bow before You, Jesus
You're the King of kings
Yahweh, Yahweh
We lift You high
Yahweh, Yahweh

You are the cloud by day
Fire by night
You gave us Your Name
To be our Guide
You are Yahweh
You are Yahweh

You're the inhale, Yahweh
You're the exhale, Yahweh
You're the inhale, Yahweh
You're the exhale, Yahweh

Every time we breathe, we say Your Name
Every time we breathe, we mention Your Name
Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh
Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh
Yahweh, Yahweh, Yahweh
