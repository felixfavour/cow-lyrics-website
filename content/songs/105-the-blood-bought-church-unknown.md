They shall lift up their voice, they shall shout for joy, they shall glorify the name of the Lord, it's the Blood bought, the church, the redeemed.

There is nothing that can stop this mighty moving force, with a shout of praise a two edged sword. Every stronghold of bondage must fall beneath our feet, every prisoner held captive must be freed. For our deliverance has come through, the power of the Son it's the blood bought the church the redeemed. 

Oh, pick up your harp, O, Zion of the Lord, let the earth ring forth with His praise. All His children rejoice from the islands of the sea, it's the blood bought the church the redeemed. 

And we are in the army of the Lod, we've been washed in the Blood and we are going forth.  There is nothing that can stop this mighty moving force, with a shout of praise a two edged sword. Every stronghold of bondage must fall beneath our feet, Every prisoner held captive must be freed.  For our deliverance has come, through the power of the Son, it's the blood bought the church the redeemed. 

Let the earth be silent, O wind, cease to blow, every creative being fold your wings, for there's a new song being sung, with a new melody, it's the blood bought the church the redeemed. 

And we are in the army of the Lod, we've been washed in the Blood and we are going forth.  There is nothing that can stop this mighty moving force, with a shout of praise a two edged sword. Every stronghold of bondage must fall beneath our feet, Every prisoner held captive must be freed.  For our deliverance has come, through the power of the Son, it's the blood bought the church the redeemed.
