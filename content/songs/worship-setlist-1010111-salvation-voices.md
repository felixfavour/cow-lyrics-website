WORSHIP 

Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the 99
And I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

PRAISE 

The Lord reigneth let the earth tremble ,
he reigneth let the earth tremble

Halleluyah
It’s an heavenly language

All things are working for my good, yeah
'Cause He's intentional
Never failing

I know that all things are working for my good, yeah
He's intentional
Never failing

Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh

From my spirit
To my soul
Until my voice
Re-echoes

You are worthy of my worship
Worthy of my praise

From my spirit
To my soul
Until my voice
Re-echoes

You are worthy of my worship
Worthy of my praise

Halle Halle Halle Lu Yah
Halle Halle Halle Lu Yah

You are worthy of my worship
Worthy of my praise

(Halle halle halle halle)
Halle Halle Halle Lu Yah
(Halle halle halle halle)
Halle Halle Halle Lu Yah
