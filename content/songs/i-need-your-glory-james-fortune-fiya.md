Show me your glory,
Hallelujah
I need your glory,
I want your glory
Less of me and more of you
Is what I need
Show me your glory, yeah
Show me your power
(Less of me)
Less of me and more of you
Is what I need
I need your glory,
I want your glory
Less of me and more of you
Is what I need
Oh, Father, show me your glory
Show me your glory,
Show me your power,
Less of me and more of you
Is what I need
So many times i tried my way
But all of the pain didnt go away
I realized that only you
Can give me this love that is so true
So many times I tried my way
But all of the pain didnt go away
I realized that only you
Can give me this love that is so true
I need your glory,
I want your glory
(Less of me, God)
Less of me and more of you
Is what I need
Show me your glory,
Show me your power,
Less of me and more of you
Is what I need
So many times I tried my way
But all of the pain didnt go away
I realized that only you
Can give me this love that is so true
So many times I tried my way
But all of the pain didnt go away
I realized that only you
Can give me this love that is so true
