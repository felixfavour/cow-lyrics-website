Wait
Get your phone, text your people they should (ask Christ)
All the problems and your needs if you just (ask Christ)
Lawyer, doctor, anything if you just (ask Christ)
You got some questions 'bout some things? You just (ask Christ)
You a king? He The King, you just (ask Christ)
Got proper comfort for the queens if they (ask Christ)
Live in favor, see the dream if you (ask Christ)
Get your phone, text your people, they should (ask Christ)
Feel you're in the shadows by yourself
You just underwater and not reaching out for help, whoa
Only wave you can't get is over your own
That tsunami blocking passage to the throne
Phone dying, worried how you getting home
Preparation, isolated and alone
Pull up like an Uber, hallelujah
Any type of music that will move ya
And we don't really care what you doing
We just walk up in the room like
I'm blessed
