I don't wanna leave this moment
I don't wanna miss one thing
Is there anything You wanna tell me?
I hang on every word You say
I'm longing for a fresh encounter
I wonder that I can't explain
Is there anything You wanna show me?
Your presence is my favorite place
You're not going anywhere
Not going anywhere
Not going anywhere
So I'm not going anywhere
Not going anywhere
Not going anywhere, oh
Nothing like Your presence
There's nothing like Your presence
Oh
I don't wanna leave this moment
I don't wanna miss one thing
Is there anything You wanna tell me?
I hang on every word You say
I'm longing for a fresh encounter
A wonder that I can't explain
Is there anything You wanna show me?
Your presence is my favorite place
I don't wanna leave this moment
I don't wanna miss one thing
Is there anything You wanna tell me?
I hang on every word You say
I'm longing for a fresh encounter
A wonder that I can't explain
Is there anything You wanna show me?
Your presence is my favorite place
