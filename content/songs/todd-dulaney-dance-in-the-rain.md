There's a river running
And it will never run dry
Lord, Rain
Lord, Rain
The floodgates are open
And it will never run dry
Lord, Rain
Lord, Rain
Release Your favor Lord, let it rain on me
Release Your power Lord, let it rain on me
Release Your glory Lord, let it rain on me
Let it rain, Let it rain
(Repeat x2)
Jump and dance in the rain
Release Your favor Lord, let it rain on me
Release Your power Lord, let it rain on me
Release Your glory Lord, let it rain on me
Let it rain, Let it rain
Jump and dance in the rain
Rain on me
Rain on me
(Repeat 4x)
Deep calls unto deep
Deep calls unto deep
(Repeat 2x)
Rain on me
Rain on me
(Repeat 8x)
