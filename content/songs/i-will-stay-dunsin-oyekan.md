Wait on the Lord, wait, wait
Stay with the Lord, stay, stay
Build up your Strength
Build up your Strength
Wait on the Lord, wait, wait
Oh my soul
Stay with the Lord, stay, stay
Build up your Strength
Build up your Strength
Wait on the lord
Wait on the Lord, wait, wait
Stay with the Lord, stay, stay
Build up your Strength
For the days ahead
Build up your Strength
Say Wait on the Lord
Wait on the lord, wait, wait
Stay with the Lord, stay, stay
Build up your Strength
No need to rush
Build up your Strength
Somebody say
I will stay
I will stay
On the altar
To drink of the living water
Till I overflow
I will be satisfied
For this is what the nation needs
I will stay
On the altar
To drink of the living water
Till I overflow
I will be satisfied
For this what the nation
For this what the nation needs
Somebody pray in the holy ghost
We decide to wait
Lift your voice and say wait on thе lord
Wait on the Lord, wait, wait
Stay with the Lord, stay, stay
Build up your Strength
Build up your Strеngth
Wait on the lord
Wait on the Lord, wait, wait
Stay
Stay with the Lord, stay, stay
Build up your Strength
(Build up your Strength)
Build up your Strength
Lift you hand and say
I will wait
Will stay
On the altar
To drink of the living water
Till I overflow
I will be satisfied
For this is what the nations needs
I will stay
On the altar
To drink of the living water
Till I overflow
I will be satisfied
For this is what the nation need
Pray to the lord say
I will stay
At the altar
To drink of the living water
Till I overflow
I will be satisfied
For this is what the nation need
Lift your hand and pray in The Holy Ghost
Somebody receive strength
Somebody receive strength
Somebody wait on the lord
I will wait on the lord
Am gonna wait
I will wait on the lord
Am gonna wait
I will wait on the lord
Am gonna wait
Am gonna wait on the lord
Am gonna wait on the lord
Am gonna wait on the lord
Am gonna wait on the lord
I will stay
I will stay
On the altar
To drink of the living water
Till I overflow
I will be satisfied
For this is what the nation needs
