one thing have I desire forever will I see to behold the beauty of his holiness and to dwell within the presence of our king
how could I ask for more. he's done so much for me. for I have tasted of the goodness of the lord and I have
 feasted at the table of the king. I just want to know him more
I just want to know him more
I just want to know him more
I just want to know him more
You've called me by your name and filled me with your love you've covered me with mercy and grace and showered me with blessings from above and yet I know there's more I hear you calling me to a place I have never been before where your love is flowing deeper than the sea. I just want to know you more
I just want to know you more
I just want to know you more
I just want to know you more
I just want to know you more
open my eyes lord I want to see all you have promised me and given to me o I want to know the secrets
that are hidden in your word. I want to know you
one day I see your face and I'll look into your eyes and through all eternity I sing your praise and forever more fulfill my heart desire.
I just want to know you more
I just want to know you more
I just want to know you more
I just want to know you more.
