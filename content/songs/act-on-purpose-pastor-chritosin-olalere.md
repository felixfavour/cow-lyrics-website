At the end of my life will I be able to speak like Paul.
That my life has been poured out as a drink offering to my world
Now, my race is run.

My purpose, purposed by my Maker.
My calling, calling me to worship
Worship my Maker.

At the end of my life will I be able to speak like Paul.
That my life has been poured out as a drink offering to my world
Now, my race is run.

My purpose, purposed by my Maker.
My calling, calling me to worship
Worship my Maker.

My purpose, purposed by my Maker.
My calling, calling me to worship
Worship my Maker.

At the end of my life will I be able to speak like Paul.
That my life has been poured out as a drink offering to my world
Now, my race is run.

Now, my race is run.
Now, my race is run.

I knew you, you before I formed you,
It's hard to, to kick against the goads
I am your Maker.

David served his generation by the will of GOD, and slept.
How GOD anointed Jesus with the Holy Ghost and power.
He was doing good.

He was doing good.
He was doing good.

My birthday, the day purpose began.
From womb He, He separated me.
I was born on purpose.

I will follow the leading of the Spirit all of my days.
He will stir up purpose in my heart to fulfil all I should.
Then I can depart.

Then I can depart.
Then I can depart.

Purpose calling, people calling, nations calling.
My spirit yearning, deep is calling, unto deep.

Just like Moses, Israel waiting, deliverance.
Am on a mission, I won't hold back, I'll give it all.

David served his generation and slept.
Separate for my work Paul and Barnabas.
It's your birthday, the day purpose began.
You have been chosen from your mother's womb

People of purpose act on purpose.
Formed for purpose, formed on purpose.
Separated for purpose, separated on purpose.
Called for purpose, called on purpose.

People of purpose act on purpose.
Formed for purpose, formed on purpose.
Separated for purpose, separated on purpose.
Called for purpose, called on purpose.
