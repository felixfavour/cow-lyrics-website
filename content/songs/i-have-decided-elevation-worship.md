I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back
Though none go with me
I still will follow
Though none go with me
I still will follow
Though none go with me
I still will follow
No turning back, no turning back
Hebrews 12 says: "Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart."Jesus, we give You our praise, You're our greatest prize, our greatest treasure and we will forsake everything to the joy of knowing You. We worship You alone in this place
