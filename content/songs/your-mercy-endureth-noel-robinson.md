Each day I will continually praise
For your goodness, your mercy and your grace
Without your peace, no love remains
Your Word in me declares Your Name
Oh Holy One we reverence Your Name
Your kingdom come, Your people to save
Your will on earth be done through me
Your Spirit leads us to victory
So I'll sing and I'll dance
Wherever I am I will shout it
You are good all of the time
And Your mercy endureth
You are good all of the time
And Your mercy еndureth forever
From thе rising to my going down
My soul rejoices in the love I found
Your goodness I just can't explain
You bring something new each and every day
So I'll sing and I'll dance
Wherever I am I will shout it
So I'll sing and I'll dance
Wherever I am I will shout it, shout it
