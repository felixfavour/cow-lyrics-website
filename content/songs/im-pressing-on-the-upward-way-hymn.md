I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining every day;
Still praying as I onward bound,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on Heaven's table land;
Where love and joy and light abound Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Tho' some may dwell where these abound,
My constant aim is higher ground.

Beyond the mist i fain would rise,
To rest beneath unclouded skies;
Above earth's turmoil peace is found,
By those who dwell on higher ground.

I long to scale the utmost height,
Though rough the way, and hard the fight;
My song, while climbing, shall resound,
Lord, lead me on to higher ground.

Lord, lead me up the mountain side
I dare not climb without my guide
And, heaven gained, I'll gaze around,
With grateful heart from higher ground.
