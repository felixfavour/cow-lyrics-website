Explorers and soldiers
In you and in I
Searching and fighting
To learn, to realize
Straight through our soul
With invisible thread
The pieces undone
Are whole now instead
[Pre-Chorus]
The fight we're in
Has already been won
Arise
For the Kingdom has come
Arise
For the Kingdom has come
Your story was made of
Beauty and soul
We're closer to heaven
Than we'll ever know
