Verse 1: [Steffany Gretzinger]
Let the King of my heart
Be the mountain where I run
The fountain I drink from
Oh, He is my song
Let the King of my heart
Be the shadow where I hide
The ransom for my life
Ohh, He is my song
'Cause You are good
You are good, oh-ohh
You are good
You are good, oh-ohh
You are good
You are good, oh-ohh
You are good
You are good, oh-ohh
And let the King of my heart
Be the wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves
Oh-oh, He is my song
Let the King of my heart
Be the fire inside my veins
The echo of my days
Oh-ohh, He is my song
Let the King of my heart
Be the wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves
Oh-oh, He is my song
Let the King of my heart
Be the fire inside my veins!
The echo of my days
Ohh, He is my song
