[Intro]
Woah
I am who I ams
Love it or leave it, baby
While you reminisce, I've been gone
Two years and the fortnight
I'm friends with the low-lives
I'm drunk tryna get high
Still waiting to exhale
Come out of the shadows
Five feet, barely three quarters
In your stilettos
Like pineapple Mentos
Your favorite confection
I'm sweet like your perfume
Strong like your mind is
Your skin dripping richness, tend to your flowers without a mention
You won your wars, you laid down your sword then gave me the weapon
[Pre-Chorus]
You say keep my promises but I don't
I should probably listеn more, yeah, mother, I know
I just wanna bе dancing again
I know
I'm to blame, I gotta heal these scars on my own
I should learn to listen more, yeah, mother, I know
I just wanna be dancing again
I know
