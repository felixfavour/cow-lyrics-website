He became sin
Who knew no sin
That we might become
His righteousness
He humbled Himself
And carried the cross
Love so amazing
Love so amazing
Jesus Messiah
Name above all names
Blessed Redeemer
Emmanuel
The rescue for sinners
The ransom from Heaven
Jesus Messiah
Lord of all
His body, the bread
His blood, the wine
Broken and poured out, all for love
The whole world trembled
And the veil was torn
Love so amazing
Love so amazing
Yeah
