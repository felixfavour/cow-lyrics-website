I'll be right there
Before the darkness calls
Before the first tear falls
You know I'll be right there
Trouble, trouble may come
You know that I'll come too
Let my love cover you
You know I'll be right there
Who do you call when you need a friend
Tell them, Jesus, Jesus
Who's the only one that can help somebody
Tell them, Jesus, Jesus
When this world's been unkind
It's the only peace you'll find
When it's way too hard to bare
All hope is gone, feelin' alone
All you really need to know
I'll be right there
Before the first tear falls
I'll be right there
Darkness calls
And I'll be right there, oh...
Trouble may come
Know that I'll come too
Let my love cover you
Because I'll be right there
