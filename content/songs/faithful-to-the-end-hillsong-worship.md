I'm saved from the grace that I've found in you
All that you've done
Through the Power of the Cross for me
I'm saved of the mercy I've found in you
All that you are, the fullness of your love for me
All that I have
Has come from your hand
All I ever know is
Jesus, you are faithful to the end
I'll tell of the wonders I've found in You
And the love that you shown
Is higher than the heaven above me
All that I have
Has come from your hand
All I ever know is
Jesus, you are faithful to the end
More than this world
Could take me from your love
All I ever know is
Jesus, you are faithful
All I ever know is
Jesus, you are faithful to the end
