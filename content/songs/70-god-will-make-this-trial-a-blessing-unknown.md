I've just come into a valley, one like I've  never been before. I keep searching for a way out, seems like pad locks on the door. Oh, there must be another sunrise, another sunset that I'll see. God will make this trial a blessing that's the love he has for me. 

God will make this trial a blessing, 'tho it sends me to my knees. "Tho my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's no need to get discouraged, there's no need to talk defeat; God will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will see. 

I was not the first one to come into this place. You see, every child of God this test must face. It is here that God will mold you and make you what you are to be. God will make this trial a blessing  just be patient you will see. 

God will make this trial a blessing, 'tho it sends me to my knees. "Tho my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's no need to get discouraged, there's no need to talk defeat; God will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will see. 

Now I'm standing on a mountain, looking back, I can see. When I was in that lowest valley, His strong hand was leading me. Oh, its good to see the sunshine and to taste sweet victory. God has made this trial a blessing, oh the grace he gives to me. 

God will make this trial a blessing, 'tho it sends me to my knees. "Tho my tears flow like a river, yet in him there's sweet relief. There's no need to get discouraged, there's no need to talk defeat; God will make this trial a blessing and the whole wide world will see.
