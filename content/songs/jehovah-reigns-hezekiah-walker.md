Have you ever known anybody
Who can turn Winter to Spring
Have you ever known anybody
Who can make the angels sing
Have you ever known anybody
Who can make the winds obey
Who can make heaven and earth bow down and say
Jehovah reigns forever
Let us worship Him together
As we lift our hands in reverence
Jehovah reigns forever [x8]
Tell me right now
If you understand what it means
He's the reason you have new life
And the reason your heart sings
If you know like I know
And your tired of pain and strife
Lift your hands up above to the Lord
For what he'll do in your life
