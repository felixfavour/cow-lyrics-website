[Spontaneous: Leeland, 
Brandon Lake
]
Show me Your glory, Jesus 
(Show me Your glory)
Show me Your glory 
(Show me Your glory)
Show us, show us Your glory 
(Show us Your glory)
In our homes again
In the midnight hour
Show us Your glory 
(Show us Your glory)
Show us Your glory
Show me Your glory 
(Show us Your glory)
Show me Your glory
You're all I want
You're all I need
Show me Your glory
[Spontaneous: Brandon Lake]
'Cause when the glory's in the room
Nothing else is needed
When the glory's in the room
Nothing else is needed
When Your glory's in the room
Nothing else is needed
It's just You, it's just You
When the glory's in the room
Nothing else is needed
When the glory's in the room
Nothing else is needed
When Your glory's in the room
Nothing else is needed
It's just You, it's just You, oh
