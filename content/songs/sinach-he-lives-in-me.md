Give somebody a high five, tell them, "Jesus is alive"
Jesus is alive
What a miracle  it is that Jesus is alive
We're lifting holy hands to Him as a witness that he lives
Do you know the same spirit that raised Him from the dead
That same is alive in me forever
Jesus is alive, the tomb is empty, Hallelujah!!
Death could not hold Him down
My heart is full, He live in me
What a miracle  it is that Jesus is alive
We're lifting holy hands to Him as a witness that he lives
Do you know the same spirit that raised Him from the dead
That same is alive in me forever
Jesus is alive, the tomb is empty, Hallelujah!!
Death could not hold Him down
My heart is full, He live in me
You see, death could not hold Him down
death could not hold Him down
death could not hold Him down
He died on the third day
He rose again in victory
(Somebody shout hallelujah!! Death could not hold Him down)
Death could not hold Him down
Death could not hold Him down
Death could not hold Him down, He lives in me
Death could not hold Him down
Death could not hold Him down
Death could not hold Him down, He lives in me
Failure can not hold me down
Fear can not hold me down
Failure can not hold me down, He lives in me
Fear can not hold me down
Failure can not hold me down
Nothing can hold me down, He lives in me
Nothing can hold me down
nothing can hold me down
nothing can hold me down, He lives in me
He lives in me, He lives in me
He lives in me, He lives in me
He lives in me, He lives in me
He lives in me, He lives in me
Wave your hands to Jesus
He lives in me
That same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
Disease can not hold me down
Diabetes can not hold me down
cancer can not hold me down
The economy can not hold me down
Nothing can hold me down
Lift up your hands and rejoice!!
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive, He's alive, He's alive, Hey!!
He lives in me, He lives in me
He lives in me, He lives in me
He lives in me, He lives in me
He lives in me, He lives in me
He lives in me, He lives in me
He lives in me, He lives in me
Lift up your hands
He's alive, He's alive
The tomb is empty, The tomb is empty, The tomb is empty
My bank account is full, My heart is full. My home is full
Wave your hands and rejoice
Wave your hands and declare
"He lives, He lives, He lives, He lives "
He lives, He lives
He lives, He lives
He lives. He lives
Yeah
yeah
