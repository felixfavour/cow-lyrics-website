Hallelujah
Would you lift Your hands and let him know
That He is the wind beneath Your wings
He's the one making things happen
In Him You live
In Him You move
In Him you have Your being
Thank You Jesus, thank You Jesus
If not for grace
Thank you for Your grace
Everybody say
It's not by my Power
And it's not by Might
I'm not that Intelligent
But for Grace
And when People Ask me
This is all I can Say
This is the Finger of God
In my Life
It's not by my Power
And it's not by Might
I'm not that Intelligent
But for Grace
And when People Ask me
This is all I can Say
This is the Finger of God
In my Life
It's not by my Power
And it's not by Might
I'm not that Intеlligent
But for Grace
And when Pеople Ask me
This is all I can Say
This is the Finger of God
In my Life
It's not by my Power
And it's not by Might
I'm not that Intelligent
But for Grace
And when People Ask me
This is all I can Say
This is the Finger of God
In my Life
I am all I am
And its by His grace
I am all I am
And its by your grace
I am all I am
And its by your grace
I am all I am
Its by your grace
I am all I am
It is by His grace
I am all I am
It is by His grace
I am all I am
It is by His grace
I am all I am
It is by His grace
I am all I am
It is by His grace
I am all I am
It is by His grace
I am all I am
It is by His grace
I am all I am
It is by His grace
And when People Ask me
This is all I can Say
This is the Finger of God
In my Life
And when People Ask me
This is all I can Say
This is the Finger of God
In my Life
And when People Ask me
This is all I can Say
This is the Finger of God
In my Life
And when People Ask me
This is all I can Say
This is the Finger of God
In my Life
