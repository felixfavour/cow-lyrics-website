A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord
A wonderful Savior to me;
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
Where rivers of pleasure I see
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love
And covers me there with His hand
And covers me there with His hand
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord
He taketh my burden away
He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved
He giveth me strength as my day
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love
And covers me there with His hand
And covers me there with His hand
When clothed with His brightness transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love
I'll shout with the millions on high
