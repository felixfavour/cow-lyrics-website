I will wait
Witch all my hands before You
My keeper
I will come running
Into Your arms
Into alone for
With all my heart
I wanna know You
You are all I want
I wanna know You, more
I will wait
Witch all my hands before You
My keeper
I will come running
Into Your arms
Into alone for
With all my heart
I wanna know You
You are all I want
I wanna know You, more
I wanna know You
You are all I want
I wanna know You, more
I wanna know You
You are all I want
I wanna know You, more
I wanna know You
You are all I want
I wanna know You
I wanna know You
I wanna know You
I wanna know You
