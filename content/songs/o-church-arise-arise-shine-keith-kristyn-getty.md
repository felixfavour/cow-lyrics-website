O church, arise, and put your armor on
Hear the call of Christ our captain
For now, the weak can say that they are strong
In the strength that God has given
With shield of faith and belt of truth
We’ll stand against the devil’s lies
An army bold, whose battle cry is love
Reaching out to those in darkness
Our call to war, to love the captive soul
But to rage against the captor
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole
We will fight with faith and valor
When faced with trials on every side
We know the outcome is secure
And Christ will have the prize for which He died
An inheritance of nations
[Chorus: Kristyn Getty, (Echo: 
Chris Tomlin
), 
Both
]
Arise (
arise
)
Shine (
oh shine
)
For your light has come (
for your light has come
)
Arise (
arise
)
Shine (
oh shine
)
For the Risen Son (
for the risen Son
)
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride
Arise, o church arise!
