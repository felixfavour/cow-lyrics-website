I call you faithful
For the promises you've kept
And every need you've met
Lord I'm so grateful
You were with me every step
And I never will forget
When I think of how you bless me
How your hand has never let me go
Never let me go
You have been so good to me
God I can't believe how you love me
What a friend you have been
So good to me
Oh God I can't believe how you love me
What a friend you have been
