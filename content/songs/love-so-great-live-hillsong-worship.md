Your love so great
Jesus in all things
I’ve seen a glimpse of Your heart
A billion years
Still, I’ll be singing
How can I praise You enough?
How can I praise You enough?
You are the Lord Almighty
Outshining all the stars in glory
Your love is like the wildest ocean
Oh nothing else compares
Creation calls
All to the Saviour
We are alive for Your praise
In earth and sky, no one is higher
Our God of wonders, You reign
Our God of wonders, You reign
You are the Lord Almighty
Outshining all the stars in glory
Your love is like the wildest ocean
Oh nothing else compares
You are the Lord Almighty
Outshining all the stars in glory
Your love is like the wildest ocean
Oh nothing else compares
