Isn't it just like Heaven
When You walk into the room?
There's not a thing that's hidden
When every eye is on You
Can't get enough of Your presence
It's the perfect point of view
Isn't it just like, just like
Just like Heaven?
Ooh
Come a little closer, stay a little longer
Ooh
I can't get enough of You
Ooh
Come a little closer, stay a little longer
Ooh
I can't get enough of You
Doesn't it sound lik–µ Heaven
When You're singing over me?
There's not a voice more constant
Your melodies they never cease
Here I will stand in Your presence
In my true identity
Doesn't it sound like? Yeah, it sounds like
Just like Heaven
