The Lord is my light and my salvation;
Whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life;
Of whom shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enimies and my foes
Came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell
Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear;
Though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident
