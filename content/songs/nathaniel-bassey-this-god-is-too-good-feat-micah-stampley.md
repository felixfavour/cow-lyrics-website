I know a God who is merciful and kind
Faithful and gracious
I'm the apple of his eyes
The thought that fills his heart
Every morning, noon and night
He loved me when I didn't care
And was patient till I came, running back into his arms
Look how he turned my life around
made me a shining star
His glory to reveal
I will worship him forever
love him forever
Because, this God Is too good o
I will worship him forever
Love him forever
Because this God is too good o
Don't look too far to see
How good he is
Just look at me e e
He took me from the miry clay
Set my feet upon the rock
I am standing in his righteousness
oh oh oh
He took away my sin and shame
Gave me a brand new name
His beloved and the redeemed
look how he turned my life around
Made me a shinning light
His glory to redeem
I will worship him forever (forever)
love him forever (this God)
Because, this God Is too good o
(I will worship him) I will worship him forever (forever)
Love him forever
(Because oh no) Because this God is too good o
Oh taste and see that he's good
(I will worship him forever) he is so good
sweeter than the honey (love him forever)
in a honeycomb (this God is too good o)
Jesus you are too good(Jesus you are too good o)
Jesus your love is too much o(Jesus, you're too good o)
Your grace, your amazing grace(his grace is too much o)
Your love is so deep(this love is too deep o)
I don't deserve you( I don't deserve you)
But I am grateful (always)
I don't deserve it(no no)
But you love me anyways
So I worship you forever
Love you forever
This God is too good o
Look what you've done for me
See how you've me free
How you washed me in your precious blood,Jesus
