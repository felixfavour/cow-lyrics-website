ti:Don Moen- Jesus Paid It All]
I hear the savior say
Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in me thine all in all
Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and thine alone
Came and changed the lepers spots
And it melt the heart of stone
Jesus paid it all
All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
For nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb
And when before the throne
I stand in him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat
Oh, Jesus paid it all
All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
Oh, Jesus paid it all
All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow
Oh, yes it is
White as snow
Jesus washed myself
White as snow
Jesus paid it all
