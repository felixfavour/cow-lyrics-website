When the lights are down
And the stage is bare
And no more magic's in the air
There's not a friend in sight to care
Your tears no one will share
I'll be your comfort through your pain
I'll be your shelter in the rain
When your sad is bad and your bad is worst
And there's no who to turn to first
When you've done everything you can
No one's there to take your hand
When you've looked around
And haven't seen me anywhere
Though when you were down
I lifted you up from there
There isn't a thing you can ask of me
I won't do
Just you put your trust in me
My love will see you through
When the final candle's flickered out
"Why me" is all you can think about
When all your joy has disappeared
Your future isn't clear
