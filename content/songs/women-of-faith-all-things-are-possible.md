Almighty God, My Redeemer
My hiding place
My safe refuge
No other name like Jesus
No power can stand against you
My feet are planted on this rock
And I will not he shaking
My hope it comes from you alone
My Lord and my salvation
Your praise is always on my lips
Your Word is living in my heart
And I will praise you with a new song
My soul will bless you Lord
You fill my life with greater joy
Yes I delight myself in you
And I will praise you with a new song
My soul will bless you Lord
My feet are planted on this rock
And I will not he shaking
My hope it comes from you alone
My Lord and my salvation
Your praise is always on my lips
Your Word is living in my heart
And I will praise you with a new song
My soul will bless you Lord
You fill my life with greater joy
Yes I delight myself in you
And I will praise you with a new song
My soul will bless you Lord
When am weak you make me strong
When I am poor, I know am rich
For in the power of your name
All things are possible
