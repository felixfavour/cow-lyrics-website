All power belongs to you alone
All power belongs to you alone
All the power belongs to you alone
All power belongs to you alone
Once you have spoken, twice I have heard
All power belongs to you alone
And when you have spoken, it surely comes to pass
All power belongs to you alone
All power belongs to you alone
All power belongs to you alone
All power belongs to you alone
All power belongs to you alone
Once you have spoken, twice I have heard
All power belongs to you alone
And when you have spoken, it surely comes to pass
All power belongs to you alone
All power belongs to you alone
All power belongs to you alone
All power belongs to you alone
All power belongs to you alone
(Interlude)
Heya hey, Heya hey
Heya hey, Heya hey
