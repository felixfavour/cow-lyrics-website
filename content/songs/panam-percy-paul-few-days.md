w years
Turning into few months
In just few days
Jesus will come
No more crying
We shall be rejoicing
In just few days
We will go home
Few years
Turning into few months
In just few days
Jesus will come
No more crying
We shall be rejoicing
In just few days
We will go home
Millions of people criticize us
Because of Jesus
Jesus that we preach
These same people
Want to exile us
With burning conscience
Hating what we teach
But I don't worry
And I don't fret
Because soon they will look for me
But then truly I'll be gone
Soon so soon
My Jesus is coming
In the twinkle of an eye
We all His children will be gone
Few years
Turning into few months
In just few days
Jesus will come
No more crying
We shall be rejoicing
In just few days
We will go home
If this world
Is our only hope
We of all people
Are the most miserable
But I've got a home prepared for me on high
With street of gold 
Jesus is coming
With His reward in His hands
To give to every everyone
Well I'm still eagerly and patiently waiting to see the day that the sky will burst open
That my Jesus will come descending
We will fly and fly
I'll meet You right there
(Few years) Few years
Turning into few months
In just few days
Jesus will come
No more crying
We shall be rejoicing
In just few days
We will go home
In just few days
In just few days
In just few days
In just few days
In just few days
We will go home
