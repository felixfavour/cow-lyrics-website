You are not alone, I'm with You
Every you go, I’m there
You don't have to be afraid
I have always been the same
You are not alone, I'm with You
Every whisper I can hear
[?] breathing out my name
I am aware of everything
You are not alone, I’m with You
So be still, be still
I am your peace, be still
You are not alone he's with you
Everywhere you go he's there
You don't have to be afraid
He has always been the same
You are not alone he's with You
Every whisper he can hear
[?] breathing out his name
He's aware of everything
You are not alone he's with You
