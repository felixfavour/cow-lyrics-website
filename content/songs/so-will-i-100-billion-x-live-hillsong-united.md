God of creation
There at the start, before the beginning of time
And with no point of reference
You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
And if the stars were made to worship, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
And if creation sings Your praises, so will I, yeah
Oh, God of Your promisе
You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void
For oncе You have spoken
All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
And if it all reveals Your nature, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You, so will I
Oh, so will I
