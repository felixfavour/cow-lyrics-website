Come into this house
And magnify the Lord
Lift up holy hands
Our hearts in one accord
For He's worthy
Worthy of all our praise
He's worthy
Worthy of all our praise
Make a melody
Sing unto the Lord
He has given us
A song and a sword
For He's worthy
Worthy of all our praise
He's worthy
Worthy of all our praise
He's worthy of honor and glory
He's worthy of power and praise
Worship and bow down
Before Him
Exalt His name today
(Repeat choruses and bridge)
