You are my God, there is none other
You stand alone as Lord of all
Giver of life, peace and prosperity
Lord, You are Lord of all
You are my God, there is none other
You stand alone as Lord of all
Giver of life, peace and prosperity
Lord, You are Lord of all
And my life belongs to You
My life belongs to You
My life belongs to You
My life belongs to You
My life belongs to You
My life belongs to You
[Bridge]
So, I will praise You with all of my heart
I will praise You with all of my strength
I will praise You with all of my life
'Cause You are Lord
I will praise You with all of my heart
I will praise You with all of my strength
I will praise You with all of my life
'Cause You are Lord
