I've tasted and seen
Yet questioned it all
Still You remain
Chased empty dreams
Ran from Your call
And turned back again

There's no other treasure on earth
That amounts to Your love
And I know

Even if everything I know
Is taken away I won't lose hope
I'll cling to the One
Who won't let go
Just give me Jesus
Give me Jesus

I've searched the world
The highs and the lows
I've seen it all
Nothing compares
Nothing comes close
You're all that I want

There's no other treasure on earth
That amounts to Your love
And I know

Even if everything I know
Is taken away I won't lose hope
I'll cling to the One
Who won't let go
Just give me Jesus
Give me Jesus

Even at times when I can't see
I'll trust in the hand that's holding me
There's only one thing that I need
Just give me Jesus
Give me Jesus

Ohh ohh
Ohh ohh

All my hope all my trust is in You
All my life all my joy in Jesus

All my hope
All my trust is in You
All my life
All my joy in Jesus

Ohh ohh
Ohh ohh

Even if everything I know
Is taken away I won't lose hope
I'll cling to the One
Who won't let go
Just give me Jesus
Give me Jesus

Even at times when I can't see
I'll trust in the hand that's holding me
There's only one thing that I need
Just give me Jesus
Give me Jesus

Even if everything I know
Is taken away I won't lose hope
I'll cling to the One
Who won't let go
Just give me Jesus
Give me Jesus

Ohh ohh
Just give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
