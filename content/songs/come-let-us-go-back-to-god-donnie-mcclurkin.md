The earth is in a blaze, the world is in a maze
The way of life today is strange and odd
(Oh, Lord)
What happened across the sea, may come to you and me
Oh, come, let us go back to God
(Go back to God)
Oh, come on, let us go back, let's go back to God
Come on, let us go back, I know the way
Way without my Lord, is mighty hard
I know death has brought to pass but it won't last
Come on, let us go back to God
There is trouble in the air, destruction is everywhere
Then man are being tramped beneath soul
And they shunt great and smoke have not begun to fall
So come, let us go back to God
Go back to God
