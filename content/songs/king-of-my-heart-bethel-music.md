Let the King of my heart
Be the mountain where I run
The fountain I drink from
Oh, He is my song
Let the King of my heart
Be the shadow where I hide
The ransom for my life
Oh, He is my song
'Cause You are good, You're good, mm-mm
You are good, You're good, mm-mm
Let the King of my heart
Be the wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves
Oh, He is my song
Let the King of my heart
Be the fire inside my veins
The echo of my days
Oh, He is my song
'Cause You are good, You're good, oh-oh
You are good, You're good, oh-oh
You are good, You're good, oh-oh
You are good, You're good, oh-oh
