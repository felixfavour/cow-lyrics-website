I need You to soften my heart
And break me apart
I need You to open my eyes
And see that You're shaping my life
[Pre-Chorus]
And all I am
I surrender
Give me faith to trust what You say
That You're good, and Your love is great
I'm broken inside, I give You my life
I need You to soften my heart
And break me apart
I need You to pierce through the dark
And cleanse every part of me
[Pre-Chorus]
All I am
I surrender
Give me faith to trust what You say
That You're good, and Your love is great
I'm broken inside, I give You my life
