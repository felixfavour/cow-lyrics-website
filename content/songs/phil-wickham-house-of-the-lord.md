We worship the God who was
We worship the God who is
We worship the God who evermore will be
He opened the prison doors
He parted the raging sea
My God He holds the victory
There's joy in the house of the Lord
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise
There's joy in the house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise
Oh-oh-oh
We shout out Your praise
We sing to the God who heals
We sing to the God who saves
We sing to the God who always makes a way
Cause He hung upon that cross
Then He rose up from that grave
My God's still rolling stones away
There's joy in the house of the Lord
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise
There's joy in the house of the Lord
Our God is surely in this place
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise
We were the beggars
Now we're royalty
We were the prisoners
Now we're running free
We are forgiven, accepted
Redeemed by His grace
Let the house of the Lord sing praise
'Cause we were the beggars
Now we're royalty
We were the prisoners
Now we're running free
We are forgiven, accepted
Redeemed by His grace
Let the house of the Lord sing praise
There's joy in the house of the Lord
(There is joy in the house)
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet (oh yeah)
We shout out Your praise (I wanna shout out Your praise)
There's joy in the house of the Lord (there is joy)
Our God is surely in this place (there is joy)
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise (we gonna shout out Your praise)
There's joy in the house of the Lord
There's joy in the house of the Lord today
And we won't be quiet
We shout out Your praise (we gonna shout out Your praise)
There's joy in the house of the Lord (there is joy, there is joy)
Our God is surely in this place (joy in this place)
And we won't be quiet (we won't be quiet)
We shout out Your praise
We shout out Your praise
There's joy in the house, there's joy in the house today
We shout out Your praise
We shout out Your praise
