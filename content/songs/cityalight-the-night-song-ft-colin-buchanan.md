In the darkness God will keep me He will stay and never sleep     In the darkness God is brighter though the night is long and deep     All this day Your hand has held me God of Heaven by my side  Thank you Father for Your goodness You will hold me through the night   In the shadows you are with me and You know my every fear    In the shadows none can harm me for the Mighty King is hereAll this day Your hand has held me God of Heaven by my sideThank you Father for Your goodness You will hold me through the night  So I find my rest in Jesus He who came to rescue me       Jesus saved me from the darkness I will rise to life with Him      All this day Your hand has held me God of Heaven by my side   Thank you Father for Your goodness You will hold me through the night
