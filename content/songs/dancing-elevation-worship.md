[Intro: Joe L Barnes]
Yeah, uh
Oh, oh
Oh
When You walked across the room
And asked me to dance with You
You said, "You're the one I choose"I couldn't believe it
Like You weren't just passing by
No, You looked me in my eyes
And I found my paradise
[Pre-Chorus: Joe L Barnes]
Oh, You are my paradise
I'm not leaving
[Chorus: Joe L Barnes]
Even if the sun drops out of the sky
Even if the stars stop shining at night
Even if the drummer stops keeping the time
If Your hands are in mine, I won't stop dancing
Dancing on the mountain of a victory
Dancing through the valley of a broken dream
Dancing on the plains of the in-between
If it's You and me, I won't stop dancing
