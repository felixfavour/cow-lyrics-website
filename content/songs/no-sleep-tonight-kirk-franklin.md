[Intro]
Oh that's the sound of love
Oh that's the sound of love
I just wanna get away with You
I just wanna fly away from what I see
Every time we fail it falls on You
Another reason for the world to not believe
See it don't feel right
When we hurt and lie
And we judge inside
Now love's been erased
You can try and hide
But no sleep tonight
Till we get this right
Let's talk about it
[Refrain]
Let's talk about love, life, faith, patience, grace, forgiveness
If not, whose gonna sleep tonight?
'Cause I'm not right
If I kill your light that you have inside
Tell me how do we sleep tonight?
How do we sleep tonight?
