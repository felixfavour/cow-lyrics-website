Time stands still whenever I'm with You
No more important place to go
There’s no rush, not in a hurry
It's okay to take it slow
[Pre-Chorus: Naomi Raine]
Minutes turning into hours, doesn't really matter
I just want You
You’re the only one I'm after, Spirit come in power
I just want You
[Interlude: Naomi Raine & 
Brandon Lake
]
Only You (
All we want is You
)
All we want is You (
All we want is You
)
Lord forgive me, I've been too busy
Trying to do this on my own
Your embrace is what I've been missing
I don't want to let it go
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Lake & Naomi Raine]
Minutes turning into hours, doesn't really matter
I just want You
You're the only one I'm after, Spirit come in power
I just want You
