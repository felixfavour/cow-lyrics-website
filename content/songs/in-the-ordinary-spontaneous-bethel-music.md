[Intro: Michaela Gentile, 
Jenn Johnson
]
In everything (
The little things
)
Dishes piled high in the kitchen sink
Let it be worship (Ayy)
Oh, You meet me in the ordinary
When I'm feeling weak, when I'm feeling tired
You find me and it's worship (Hey, let it be, let it be, let it be)
You're the only One worthy of all my moments
All my time, all my affection, all my life (Ayy, oh-oh)
[Spontaneous: Jenn Johnson, 
Michaela Gentile
]
'Cause You are so worthy, worthy, worthy
Worthy, worthy, worthy (
Ayy
)
Worthy, worthy, worthy (
Ooh
)
Of all the little moments
You're worthy, worthy, worthy
You are worthy, worthy, worthy (
Oh-oh
)
You are worthy, worthy, worthy
Of everything (Oh) (
Ayy
)
Of evеrything, of everything
Worthy, worthy, worthy
Worthy, worthy, worthy
Of evеrything (Ayy, ayy-ayy)
Of all of me, oh (Oh)
