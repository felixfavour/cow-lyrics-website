[Instrumental]
Holy Spirit break us, come and overtake us
You're the One we're living for
Holy Spirit lead us to the heart of Jesus
There is nothing we want more
Teach us how to live beyond ourself
Let everything we say and do
Bring glory to Your name and bless Your heart
God, show us how to love like You
Holy Spirit break us, come and overtake us
You're the One we're living for
Holy Spirit lead us to the heart of Jesus
There is nothing we want more
[Post-Chorus 1]
We want more, we want more
Strip away my pride and selfishness
Take me back to my first love
Falling on my knees, now I confess
That You will always be enough, enough
