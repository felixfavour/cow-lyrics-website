Our Father, in heaven
Please hear me now I pray
We need You more than ever
In a million different ways
There are wars on every land
Poverty inside of man
The Earth is groaning from within
Deliver us again
From the evil that devours
Consume it with Your power
We implore You now this hour
We pray
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
Right here on Earth as it is in heaven
Come, set up Your throne
And let Thy kingdom come
Our Father, in heaven
So holy is Your name
The angels, they adore You
Soon all Earth will do the same
Where every tear that we have cried
Will be comforted and dried
We'll eat from the tree of life
And life will never end
And we'll worship at Your throne
Where You'll make Your Glory known
That You are God and God alone
And we pray
