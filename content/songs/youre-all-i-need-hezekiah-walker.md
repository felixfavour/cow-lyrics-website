You're all I need, every breath You breathe through me
You're all I need, let Your rivers flow through me
You're all I need, every breath You breathe through me
You're all I need, let Your rivers flow through me
You're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need, every breath You breathe through me
You're all I need, let Your rivers flow through me
You're all I need, every breath You breathe through me
You're all I need, let Your rivers flow through me
You're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need
You're all I need
He said if I be lifted I'll draw all men to me
You're my closest friend, in you I live, have my being
I wanna draw closer
(Need to draw closer)
And if I be lifted I'll draw all men to me
You're my closest friend, in you I live, have my being
I wanna draw closer, need to draw closer
I wanna draw closer to Thee, to Thee
