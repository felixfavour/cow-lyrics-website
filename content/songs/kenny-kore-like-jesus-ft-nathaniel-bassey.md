I wanna be like Jesus
i'll give my life away
i'll change my language
To those of yonder
brother don't bother
if you see me in pains
walking the trails of my Maker
Oh Lord Jesus,
I wanna be conformed
To Your image, You are my expectation.
Oh Lord Jesus,
I wanna be conformed
To Your image, You are my expectation.
Heeeeyyyy! File!!! {leave it}
I don't care if I live or die
I don't care if I live or die
I wanna be like Jesus, My Maker
I wanna be like Jesus
pure and Holy, simple and lowly.
He's no intruder.
He is my my Friend
This Jesus is my friend
The best i've ever had
And He's my Maker
Oh Lord Jesus, I wanna be conformed to Your image, You are my expectation
Oh Lord Jesus, I wanna be conformed to Your image, You are my expectation
Heeeeyyyy! File!!! {leave it}
I don't care if I live or die
I don't care if I live or die
I wanna be like Jesus, My Maker
I don't care if I live or if i die
I don't care if I live or die
I wanna be like Jesus, My Maker
Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher
Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher
I am going I just got to leave them behind, my Maker
Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher
I am going I just got to reach out to You, my Maker
No fear, no shame, no guilt
if I am like You, My Maker
No fear, no shame, no guilt
if I am like Jesus, My Maker
No fear, no shame, no guilt
if I am like You, my maker;
No fear, no shame, no guilt
if I am like You, my maker;
I wanna Walk like You, Think like You, Talk like You, dress like You,
Look like You, Act Like you,
Be like You Jesus!!!,
My Maker Jesus!!!
Take me over
Do Lord, do Lord!!!
