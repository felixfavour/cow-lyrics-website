[Intro]
O-o-o o-oh, O-o-o o-oh
O-o-o o-oh, O-o-o o-oh
Woah-o-o o-oh, Woah-o-o o-oh
Woah-o-o o-oh, Woah-o-o o-oh
You make the darkness run and hide
You bring the broken back to life
Only You can, only You can
You set me free from every chain
You fill my heart with songs of praise
Only You can, only You can
[Pre-Chorus]
Jesus, You're the only reason
That I'm even breathing
I am wide awake!
My heart beats, only for Your glory
My hands reach, up for You to hold me
My soul sings, "Father You are holy"My feet dance, to Your rhythm, to Your rhythm
Oh, every beat is calling
Every beat is calling out Your name
O-o-o o-oh, O-o-o o-oh
O-o-o o-oh, O-o-o o-oh
