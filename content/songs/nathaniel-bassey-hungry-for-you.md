I'm Hungry for you
I'm Hungry for you
I have come to the Table to Eat
I'm Thirsty for you
I'm Thirsty for you
I have come to the Waters to Drink
I'll Tarry and not let you go
Come Fill me till I Overflow
Sweet Holy Spirit, Spirit
Sweet Holy Spirit
Help me Lord Jesus, Jesus
More than before

I want to know you
I want to know you
More than I have known you before
I want to Love you
I want to really Love you
With every bit of my Heart
So I'll Tarry and not let you go
Come Fill me till I Overflow, once again
I'll Tarry and not let you go
Come Fill me till I Overflow
Sweet Holy Spirit, Spirit
Precious Holy Spirit
Help me Sing Jesus, Jesus
Much more than before
Sweet Holy Spirit, Spirit
Precious Holy Spirit
Help me Sing Jesus, Jesus
More than before
[Trumpet]
I'm Hungry for you
I'm Hungry for you
I have come to the Table to Eat
I'm Thirsty for you
I'm Thirsty for you
I have come to the Waters to Drink
I'll Tarry and not let you go
Come Fill me till I Overflow
I'll Tarry and not let you go
Come Fill me till I Overflow
Sweet Holy Spirit
Sweet Holy Spirit
Help me know Jesus
Help me See Jesus,
More than before
More than before
More than I ever know
Sweet Holy Spirit
My Helper,
My Strength,
My Lifter,
My Comforter,
My Stand-by,
Help me See Jesus,
Help me Know Jesus
More than before
More than before
This world needs Jesus
Such a dark world,
Confused
This world needs the Light
I will arise and shine the Light
Help me See Jesus,
Help me Know Jesus
Help me Know Jesus
More than before
