Come on, God is in this house
I've got Jesus, Jesus
He calls me for His own
And He lifts me, lifts me
Above the world I know
God is in the house, there is no doubt
God is in the house, can't keep Him out
As for you
(As for you)
As for me
(As for me)
We're gonna serve the Lord
As for me God, came and found me
As for me, He took me home
As for me, He gave me a family
And I'll never walk alone
In my life I'm soaked in blessing
And in Heaven there's a great reward
As for me and my house
We're gonna serve the Lord
I got Jesus, Jesus
He calls me for His own
And He lifts me, lifts me
Above the world I know
