Your blood has my future written
Your heart loves with no condition
I'm invited into freedom, forgiven
Whiter than the snow
There's a living fount I know
Where grace and mercy overflow
Love has come to set me free
I've got this joy inside of me
All my delight, all my delight is found in You
All my delight, all my delight is found in You
Your joy is a force that can't be broken
Your hope is a gift that won't be stolen
Oh, it's contagious, infectious
And it's burning in my soul
There's a living fount I know
Where grace and mercy overflow
Love has come to set me free
I've got this joy inside of me
All my delight, all my delight is found in You
All my delight, all my delight is found in You
