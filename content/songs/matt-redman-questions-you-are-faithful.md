In all of our questions all of our searching
When we are wrestling you don't let go
In all of our fears and doubts all of our anxious thoughts
When we are restless still we are held
Lord I believe but help my unbelief
The questions come but you remain
The battles roar but still you reign
And I believe one thing will never change
'Cause you are faithful you are faithful
In all of our chaos you will be constant
You can be trusted above it all
All of our fears and doubts all of our anxious thoughts
You are not absent within the storm
The questions come but you remain
The battles roar but still you reign
And I believe one thing will never change
'Cause you are faithful you are faithful
Oh the questions come but you remain
The battles roar but still you reign
And I believe one thing will never change
'Cause you are faithful 'cause you are faithful
Lord I believe but help my unbelief
Lord I believe but help my eyes to see
You are faithful you are faithful
Yes you are faithful god to the end
You are faithful you are faithful
Yes you are faithful god to the end
You are faithful you are faithful
Yes you are faithful god to the end
You are faithful you are faithful
Yes you are faithful god to the end
You are faithful you are faithful
Yes you are faithful god to the end
You are faithful you are faithful
Yes you are faithful god to the end
You are faithful you are faithful
Yes you are faithful god to the end
O you are
O you are
O you are
God I have questions
But I come with reverence
Surrender at your throne
And I trust your word
I trust your heart
I trust your name
I trust my god
O my soul rise up
Worship him
Worship him
Move beyond all the unknown
To the known
To a god who's on his throne
You're ruler of my life
You're reigning and ruling
With sovereignty with kindness with goodness
With greatness with mercy
Come on come on
'Cause you are faithful you are faithful
You are faithful god to the end
You are faithful you are faithful
You are faithful
You are you are you are
I believe I believe in you
And you are faithful even when we are faithless
'Cause you are faithful god to the end
You are you are you are
