You've done so much for me
I can not tell it all
Narekele mo
If I had ten thousand tongues
It still won't be enough
Narekele mo
Chukwu na gwom'oria le
When You heal, You heal completely
Narekele mo
Chukwu mar'obimo
Isi ikendu le
Narekele mo
[Pre-Chorus: Travis Greene & Tim Godfrey]
What shall I render to Jehovah?
For He has done so very much for me
What shall I render to Jehovah?
For He has done so very much for me
[Chorus: Travis Greene & Tim Godfrey]
Nara, nara eh
Narekele
Narekele mo
Nara, nara eh
Narekele
Narekele mo
Narekele n'jiriba, narekele n'jiriba (Nara, nara eh)
Narekele n'jiriba (Narekele)
Narekele n'jiriba (Narekele mo)
Nara, nara eh
Narekele
Narekele mo
Narekele n'jiriba, receive our praise (Nara, nara eh)
Receive our praise (Narekele)
Narekele mo
