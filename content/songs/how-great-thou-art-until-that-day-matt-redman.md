Oh Lord, my God
When I, in awesome wonder
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made
I see the stars
I hear the mighty thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed
[Chorus: Cody Carnes & Hillary Scott]
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
And when I think
That God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on the cross
My burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin
