[Intro - 
Daughter
 (Kirk Franklin)]
Hello
(Hey, it's me, Kirk, I need to speak to Bishop)
Sure, hold on...
(Hello?) Hey, I got some stuff I need to talk to you about
Lately, pastor I've been having all these crazy kind of dreams
It's hard to sleep, I can't eat
Scary, you know (I know what you mean)
I mean, ever since that Tuesday
Seems like life's just getting real strange (I hear ya)
Anthrax, terrorist attacks and
I ain't even trying to get on no plane (I feel ya)
And you know when I try to pray
There's a voice that telling that God's not real
(You know that's just the enemy)
Yea, but you ain't feelin' me (No son, I know just know you feel)
(See, just because I preach and teach)
(Don't mean I don't get scared sometimes)
Yea, whatever, but you T.D. Jakes (Well, then I don't make mistakes)
Well (Now, let me tell you what's on my mind)
[Chorus: T.D Jakes {Kirk Franklin} (Singer)]
When your smile is gone (He cares)
{Yea, but I feel so alone} (He's there and)
Although, your heart is heavy, God said
(Every burden I will bear)
{See, but you don't know my} (my pain)
{And I'm getting so sick and tired of all} (this rain)
{I just got laid off, and to top it off the rent's due}
{So tell me what I got to gain?}
Well, see, trials come to make (you strong)
Storms won't last (last long)
{But how can I trust God in all this mess?}
Well, see that's the reason for the song
See, wherever you go there's one thing ya got to know
God, is right there by your side 
(weeping may endure for a night)
And he told me to tell you everything
(Everything's gon' be alright)
