[Intro]
My heart is steadfast O God, my heart is steadfast
I will sing and make music
I will praise You, O Lord among the nations
I will sing of You among the people's
For great is Your love reaching to the heavens
Your faithfulness reaches to the skies
Be exalted O God above the heavens
Let Your glory be over all the earth
[Interlude]
Give thanks to the Lord, Our God and King
His love endures forever
For He is good, He is above all things
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
With a mighty hand and outstretched arm
His love endures forever
For the life that's been reborn
His love endures forever
Sing praise, sing praise
Sing praise, sing praise
