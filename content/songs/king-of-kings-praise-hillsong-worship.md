In the darkness we were waiting
Without hope without light
'Til from Heaven You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the Word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt
Praise the Father, praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, three in one
God of glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To rеdeem the whole creation
You did not dеspise the cross
For even in Your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake You died
