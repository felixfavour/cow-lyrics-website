VERSE 1:
Father in Heaven
Holy is Your Name
Your kingdom come
Your will be done on earth
As it is in Heaven
Our Father in Heaven
PRE-CHORUS:
Lead us not into temptation
God deliver us from the enemy
CHORUS:
Yours is the kingdom
And the power and the glory
Forever
VERSE 2:
Give us each moment
All that we need
Forgive us our sins
As we forgive the ones
Who have sinned against us
Our Father in Heaven
BRIDGE:
Our Father have Your way
On the earth
Your will be done
