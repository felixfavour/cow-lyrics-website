I can sing a billion songs 
Dance till my feet are numb 
Spin till I'm empty and poor 
Can't praise you enough 
Shout till my voice gives way 
Leap till I have no strength 
Lose my breath trying to explain 
Can't praise you enough 
And if time were to stall, I can never tell it all 
Words are few, so this will have to do 
I just wanna thank You 
I just wanna thank You 
I just wanna thank You 
Oh I'm grateful 
You sang till I found my song 
You danced till my heart woke up 
Now I move to the rhythm of love 
I can't praise You enough 
You wept my till I found my way 
You lost your breath dying to save 
I'll never go back to that grace 
I can't praise You enough 
And if time were to stall, I can never tell it all 
Words are few, so this will have to do 
I just wanna thank You 
I just wanna thank You 
I just wanna thank You 
Oh I'm grateful 
Standing in the promise 
Surrounded by Your goodness 
You have overwhelmed us 
Hallelujah 
Standing in the promise 
Surrounded by Your goodness 
You're just getting started 
Hallelujah
