As I count these blessings it occurs to me
That there's never been a time You ain't been good to me
Kind and patient
Wonderful
Your love is amazing
So glad I'm Yours
Then the cares of life just want some time with me
And I get lonely and lose sight of all our history
You've been consistent
When I forget it
You give me hints to help me remember
All along, all along
You've been there
All along
Ooh, all along, all along
There with me
All along
And I love You there
Just stay right there
Please, stay right there
'Cause I need You there
Don't go nowhere
Don't go nowhere
'Cause I love You there, Lord
Stay right there
Please, stay right there
'Cause I need You there
Don't go nowhere
Don't go nowhere
You take my tears away, so I won't lose to sorrow
Why lose sleep when I know that You hold tomorrow?
The way You care for me
It's impressive
You're always present, oh
All along, all along
You've been there
All along (All along)
Ooh, all along, all along
There with me
All along
And I love You there
Just stay right there
Please, stay right there
'Cause I need You there
Don't go nowhere
Don't go nowhere
Lord, I love You there, just
Stay right there
Please, stay right there
'Cause I need You there
Don't go nowhere
Don't go nowhere
Through the fire
Even down to the wire
I know You're gonna be walking with me
To the end of the earth
So I can rise up
And be bold like a lion
'Cause I know You're gonna be
Strengthening me
When I look back all I see is
All along, all along
You've been there
All along
Ooh, all along, all along
There with me
All along
And I love You there
Just stay right there
Please, stay right there
'Cause I need You there
Don't go nowhere
Don't go nowhere
'Cause I love You there, Lord
Stay right there
Please, stay right there
'Cause I need You there
Don't go nowhere
Don't go nowhere
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yaya yaaya, yaaaya yaya yaya
Ooh, ooh
