Far away and close by
Catching tears when I cry
I close my eyes and you are there
Like the wind that can't be seen
Yet, felt in autumn's breeze
I call Your name and You appear
Let me know that You will always be
Standing by my side
And while You're here, please let me say
That You're my everything
And while You're here, please let me say
You're my everything, yeah
I know that there's more
(There are more)
Lonely souls You've died for
Yet, You find the time to spend time with me
(Yet, You find the time)
Like a father with His child
Protect me from the wild
Then reassure me I'm Your own
Let me know that You will always be
Standing by my side
