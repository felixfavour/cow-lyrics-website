I searched the world
But it couldn't fill me
Man's empty praise and treasures that fade
Are never enough
Then You came along
And put me back together
And every desire is now satisfied
Here in Your love (hey)
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
(Oh, yes I know it's true)
(Come on, tell 'em, hey)
I'm not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws, Lord, You've seen them all
And You still call me friend
'Cause the God of the mountain
Is the God of the valley
There's not a place Your mercy and grace
Won't find me again
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
(I know it's true)
Oh, there's nothing (somebody testify) better than You
Oh, there's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You're the only one who can (come on)
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory (tell 'em now)
You're the only one who can
You turn graves into garden
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can (please sing for me)
You're the only one who can
Oh, there's nothing (come on choir) better than You
Oh, there's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You (search and I found)
Oh, there's nothing better than You
Oh, there's nothing (nothing) better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You're the only one who can
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can
Jesus, you're the only one
Come on, give 'em one more shot of praise
