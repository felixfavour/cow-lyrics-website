John tells of a city that He saw coming down, where no sorrow or death will be known.

That some day we could go there through God's marvelous grace, forever live in that Heavenly home. 

Oh, I can almost see the light of that city, I see them gathered all around the great white throne.

Through faith in my Savior and His wonderful love, Oh, I can almost see the light of home. 

Well, sometimes when I'm burdened, and my cross gets hard to bear, and old satan, he tries to dim my view. 

Then I look up to Jesus, He is standing close by. And once again His great light shines through.

Oh, I can almost see the light of that city, I see them gathered all around the great white throne.

Through faith in my Savior and His wonderful love, Oh, I can almost see the light of home.
