1.  HALLELUYAH our joy cometh,
Angels from heaven descending,
Purposer to give us blessing,
That our joy may be eternal.
Chorus: We that are looking unto God,
Let us never be discouraged,
We shall all share in the blessing,
By the grace of our God on high.

2.  Halleluyah our joy has come,
Angels from Heaven have descended,
Purposer to given us blessing,
That our joy may be eternal.
Chorus: We that are looking unto God
Let us never be discouraged. 
Amen.
