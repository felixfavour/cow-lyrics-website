ey are the future
Living treasures
Look into their eyes
You'll see a glimpse of The Divine
They are the promise
To endless possibilities
The radiance of their smile
Reflecting the depths of Heaven's heart
Every child is your child
Every child has a right to dream
They're capable of anything so let's make them believe it
If we would only lend a hand
To build a strong foundation
This is our call to action
Let's make their dreams come true
Oooooooooooooo
They're the solution
To all of our problems
No silence is not an option
Raise your voice roar like the lion
To their defence
Don't ignore the cry for help
Can we unite, let's come together
We'll make their lives a little better
Cos don't forget
Every child is your child
Every child has a right to dream
They're capable of anything so let's make them believe it
If we would only lend a hand
To build a strong foundation
This is our call to action
Let's make their dreams come true
Yes you can change the world is waiting on you
To move against the odds
They're waiting on us
Give them hope for a brighter tomorrow
Let's ignite the spark
And they'll burn like wildfire
Every child is your child
Every child has a right to dream
They're capable of anything so let's make them believe it
If we would only lend a hand
To build a strong foundation
This is our call to action
Will you make their dreams come true
