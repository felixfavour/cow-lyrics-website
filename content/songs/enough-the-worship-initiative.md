And all of you
Is more than enough for
All of me
For all every thirst and every need
You satify me with your love
And all i have in you
Is more than enough
You are my supply
My breath of life
Still more awesome than i know
You are my reward
Worth living for
Still more awesome than i know
All of you
Is more than enough for
All of me
For every thirst and every need
You satify me with your love
And all i have in you
Is more than enough
You're more than enough
Your my sacrifice
Of greatest price
Still more awesome than i know
You're the coming king
You are everything
Still more awesome than i know
All of you
Is more than enough for
All of me
For every thirst and every need
You satisfy me with your love
And all i have in you
Is more than enough
You're more than enough
More than all i want
More than all i need
You are more than enough for me
More than all i know
More than all i can see
You are more than enough
More than all i want
More than all i need
You are more than enough for me
More than all i want
More than all i can see
You are more than enough
All of you
Is more thanenough for
All of me
For every thirst and every need
You satisfy me
With your love
And all i have in you is more than enough
All i have in you is more than enough
More than enough
More than enough
