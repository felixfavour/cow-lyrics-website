[Intro]
You guys got one more in you?
Good
C'mon if you know it, sing it with me
Ayy
Sometimes on this journey, I get lost in my mistakes
What looks to me like weakness is a canvas for Your strength
And my story isn't over, my story's just begun
Failure won't define me 'cause that's what my Father does, I said
Yeah, failure won't define me 'cause that's what my Father does
Help me sing it, ooh
Ooh, lay your burdens down (Ooh)
Ooh, here in the Father's house (Ooh)
Check your shame at the door (Ooh)
'Cause it ain't wеlcome anymore (Ooh)
Ooh, you're in thе Father's house
Arrival's not the end game, the journey's where You are
You never wanted perfect, You just wanted my heart
And the story isn't over, if the story isn't good
And failure's never final when the Father is on the roof
A failure's never final when the Father is in the room
