I took a journey through the devil's door
Chasing the freedom that I thought was Yours
Just found the bottom of an icy floor and regret
[Pre-Chorus]
With trembling hands and an empty breath
You saw the struggle and You cast the nets
You knew me better than I ever knew myself
And now the only thing that's left... oh-oh-ooh
Is Your love
Is Your love
I crossed the ocean and I searched the sky
For the riddles and the reasons why
You give a beggar like me a royal life, oh-oh-ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
With trembling hands and an empty breath
You saw the struggle and You cast the nets
You knew me better than I ever knew myself
And now the only thing that's left... oh-oh-ooh
