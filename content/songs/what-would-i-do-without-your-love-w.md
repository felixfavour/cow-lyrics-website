What would I do without your love
I feel the warmth of your arms around me
Look what you've done already
What would I do without your love

I feel the warmth of your arms around me
Look what you've done already
My eyes are open to see
My ears are open to hear
My mouth is open to speak
Of your love


I have tasted and seen
That the Lord is good to me
I'm assured and I know
That the Lord is kind to me

I have tasted and seen
That the Lord is good
He's good He's good to me

All my life all my days
I'm surrounded by your love
As I look upon your face
It overwhelms me like a flood

All my life all my days
I'm surrounded by your love
As I look upon your face
It overwhelms me like all my life


It overwhelms me like a flood
Like a flood, like a flood
I keep drowning and drowning
And drowning in this love
Cause I've seen what you've done
Already...
