What is buried, You can raise again
What is lifeless, You'll breathe life within
What seems over to You, it's not the end
There's nothing that You cannot do
I'm ready, God, to see You move
There's resurrection power
Right here, it's breaking out
Let dead things come to life
Let dry bones come alive
The One who empties graves
Is here to do the same
Let dead things come to lifе
Let dry bones come alivе
[Refrain]
Come alive, come alive
Let dead things come to life
Come alive, come alive
Let dry bones come alive
Out of darkness, You've brought victory
Tore the veil and made a way for me
Now I'm standing with the risen King
Staring at an empty tomb
'Coz Jesus, You're the living proof
There's nothing that You cannot do
I'm ready, God, to see You move
