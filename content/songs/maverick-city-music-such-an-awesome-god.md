Verse
You call the sun to rise
You lay it down to rest
You hold this heart of mine
You hold my every breath
Chorus
Such an awesome god
So mighty so holy so wonderful
Such an awesome God
So selfless so generous so faithful you are
Verse
Seated in majesty
Reigning in holiness
The table is set for me
For you are the living bread
Bridge
And nothing comes close to the lord almighty
Nothing as sweet as his love and mercy
Verse
Jesus the son of god
Hung on a cross to die
But not even death itself could hold you down
For you rose to life
