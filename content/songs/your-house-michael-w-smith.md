[Instrumental]
Come out of the dark and in from the cold
Join the song of the earth, born in the heavens
See His glory like fire rising like smoke
One voice calling out, the King is among us
[Pre-Chorus]
He is good, His love endures
He is good, and His love endures
We come into Your house
We come into Your house
We come into Your house
With thanksgiving and praise
We come into Your house
We come into Your house
We come into Your house
With thanksgiving and praise
All for Your name
Oh we have this hold, firm and secure
Now we enter in, alive in the promise
