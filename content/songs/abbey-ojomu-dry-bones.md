The word of the lord
to Ezekiel the prophet
son of man
can these bones live again
(repeat)
Oh dry bones
thus saith the lord
this day, you are covered with flesh
(repeat)
(speaking in tongues)
suddenly there was a shaking and noise
bones came back to bones, bones covered with flesh
yes, dry bones live again
dry bones live again (repeat)
dry bones shall rise again (call and response) (repeat)
(speaking in tongues)
impossibilities become possible ( call and response) (repeat)
