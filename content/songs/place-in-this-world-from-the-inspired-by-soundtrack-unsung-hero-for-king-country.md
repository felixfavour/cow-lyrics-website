The wind is moving but I am standing still
A life of pages waiting to be filled
A heart that's hopeful, a head that's full of dreams
But this becoming is harder than it seems
[Pre-Chorus: Luke Smallbone]

My place in this world, my place in this world
If there are millions down on their knees
Among the many,

Hear me asking: 
"Where do I belong?"Is there a vision 
that I can call my own?
[Pre-Chorus: Luke Smallbone]
Show me
I'm
