More than my mouth can testify
More than my mind can comprehend

See I've seen the wonders of your grace
I'm so sure that this is not the end

Eze ebube
See how far you've brought me
Eze ebube
I'm so glad you found me worthy

I can see, I can tell
And I know it's your grace
All my days I will sing your praise


My heart is full of gratitude
To you and no one else but you

Lord I'm here only by your grace
Thank you Jesus for not giving up on me

Grace found me
Grace saved me
Grace made me who I am
Grace redeemed me
Grace sustains me
Grace made me who I am
