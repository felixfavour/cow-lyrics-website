Be still my heart and know, You are God alone
Stop thinking so much and just let go
Be still my soul and rest, humbly I confess
In my weakness, Your strength is perfect
For You alone are God
There will be no other
And You have won my heart
More than any other
So I will give it all
‘Cause You gave it all for me
[Interlude]
Be still my heart and know, You are God alone
Stop thinking so much and just let go
Be still my soul and rest, humbly I confess
In my weakness, Your strength is perfect
For You alone are God
There will be no other
And You have won my heart
More than any other
So I will give it all
‘Cause You gave it all for me
All for You
