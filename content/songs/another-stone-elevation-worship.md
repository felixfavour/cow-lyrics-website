*lyrics not final
God, I know that what You promise
Will be better than I thought
You will finish what You started
Resurrection is who You are
[Pre-Chorus]
We're not three days away
From an empty grave
Another stone is rolling in the room right now
Is it you right now? A new you right now
Another stone is rolling in the room right now
Is it you right now? A new you right now
Another stone is rolling
Jesus, come and move in power
Miracles are what You do
If you said it, I expect it
Itâ€™s an easy thing for You
[Pre-Chorus]
We're not three days away
From an empty grave
