When Sunday comes, my trouble gone
As soon as it gets here, I'll have a new song
When Sunday comes
I won't have to cry no more
Jesus will soothe my troubled mind
All of my heartaches will be left behind;
When Sunday comes
Chorus:
Just to behold His face, His saving grace
Oh yes, I've got to see Jesus for me
When Sunday comes (2 times)
Vamp 1:
Come Sunday
Come Sunday
Vamp 2:
Come Sunday, shout my troubles over
Come Sunday, cry no more
Sunday
Come Sunday, see His face
Sunday
Come Sunday, saving grace
Vamp 3:
Sunday (7 times)
Hallelujah
Sunday(8 times)
Thank You Jesus
Ending:
When Sunday comes
