You put a song in my heart rythm in my step
Praise as my garment for the spirit of heaviness
Beauty for ashes joy for my pain
Love overwhelming causes me to say
You've made me glad
You've made me glad
You've made me glad
Lord I will rejoice because You have
You've made me glad
You've made me glad
You've made me glad
Lord I will rejoice because You have made me glad
So I will lift my hands and lift my voice
The way I feel I have no choice
You made me glad
I'm gonna dannce and sing and shout for joy
And praise Your name I will rejoice
You made me glad
Lord we declare
Who can compare
Who would even dare
Cause there is no one like You
