Lord I love
To worship You
O Lord I love
To worship You
You have given me so much
To be thankful for
And I love You is not enough
To express my love
Everything I have inside of me
Lord I give to You
There is nothing I can do
There is nothing I can do
There is nothing I can do
But worship You
O Lord I love
To worship You
Yes Lord I love
To worship You
You have given me so much
To be thankful for
And my words are not enough
To express my love
So everything I have inside of me
Lord I give to You
And there is nothing more to do
Lord there is nothing more to do
There is nothing more to do
But worship You
Worship You
