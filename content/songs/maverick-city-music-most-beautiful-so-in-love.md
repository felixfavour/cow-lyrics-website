One thing I desire
Only this I seek
Just to dwell dwell dwell
Here forever
This will be my posture
Laying at Your feet
Oh just to dwell dwell dwell
Here forever
Dearest Father
Closest Friend
Most beautiful
Most beautiful
One thing I desire
Only this I seek
Just to dwell dwell dwell
Here forever
This will be my posture
Laying at Your feet
Oh just to dwell dwell dwell
Here forever
Dearest Father
Closest Friend
Most beautiful
Most beautiful
There are no words
There's nothing left
Our love sings to You
Oh oh oh
Dearest Father
Closest Friend
Most beautiful
Most beautiful
There are no words
There's nothing left
Our love sings to You
Oh oh oh
I'm so in love with You, You're beautiful, so beautiful
I fix my eyes on You, You're beautiful, so beautiful
With just one look everything changes
I'm captivated and I'll never be the same
