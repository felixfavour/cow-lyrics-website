I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom, for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed days and the dark sacred nights
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
[Bridge]
The colors of a rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"They're really saying, "I love you"[Refrain]
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"They're really saying, "I love you"I hear babies cry, and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Oh, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
