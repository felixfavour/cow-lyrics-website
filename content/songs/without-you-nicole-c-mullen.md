Earth without space
Clock without face
Ocean with no water
Sun with no moon
That's me without you
Let me take a moment to smell the roses of my life
All the things I treasure you supply
The love of a mother
And a heartfelt press of a child
Laughter with my good friends my babys smile
Ooo ooo
Every sunrise
When my skies are blue
Breath of heaven
I feel you
With each heartbeat
My soul is renewed
Can't live my life without you
I hope it never happens
But on any given day
My whole world could shatter and fade away
But after all the heart aches
And tears that I cry
You'd be there to comfort me
Till again I'd realize
