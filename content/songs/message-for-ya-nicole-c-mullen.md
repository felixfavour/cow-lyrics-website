In my kitchen there's a lady on TV
Beneath the burning sun so far away
And her baby's eyes are staring straight at me
With all the innocence that seem to say
Check, what you gon' do to help me
Check, like the water jar my belly's empty
Check, what can you do to make it better
Check, gotta do something so I can tell him
Gotta message for my sista girls
Gotta message for my baby girls
Gotta send it, send it 'round the world
'Cause I got a message for ya
Gotta message for my brother man
That we gotta give it, give it all we can
Justa' spread the love of God around the land
'Cause gotta message for ya
There's little brother livin' down the street
Struggling to do the best he can
His mama gives him clothes and food to eat
But can't show him how to be a man
