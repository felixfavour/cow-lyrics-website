Oh-oh-oh-oh... (x6) Oh...
Can you hear the sound of the righteous rising?
Can you hear the sound of freedom?
The curse of sin is broken
Christ has set us free
We have the victory, He gave us victory
(Chorus: x4)
I'm an overcomer (I'm an overcomer)
I am more than a conqueror (more than a conqueror)
Oh-oh-oh-oh... (x6) Oh...
We can that all creation's waiting
To walk in this glorious liberty
The curse of sin is broken
Christ has set us free
We have the victory, He gave us victory
(Chorus)
(Bridge:)
I may go through persecution, tribulation
I'm persuaded that nothing ever will be able
To separate me from this love
In all these things, through Him that loved us
We are more than conquerors!
