strumental
Someone asked a question
Do you believe in these miracles?
How do you open blind eyes?
How can a lame man start walking?
What is the source of your strength?
Instrumental
Yes I believe in these miracles
I open the blind eyes by faith
God is the source of my strength
He's the same yesterday and today
My God is still changing lives (Still changing lives)
He's still around doing good (Still changing lives)
He is the source of my strength
My God is still changing lives
Changing lives (Still changing lives)
Changing lives (Still changing lives)
Changing lives
My God is still changing lives (Still changing lives)
Instrumental
Changing lives (Still changing lives)
Changing lives (Still changing lives)
Changing lives
My God is still changing lives
My God is still changing lives
He's still around doing good
He is the source of my strength
My God is still changing lives (Still changing lives)
Still changing lives
