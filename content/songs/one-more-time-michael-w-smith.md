There always seems to be a door that you can't open
There always seems to be a mountain you can't climb
But you keep on reaching
You just keep on reaching
When your destiny is out there in the distance
But the road ahead's a mine field in disguise
And you keep on moving
You just keep on moving
You will make it through this
Just give it time
You gotta give it time
(Chorus)
This is what you're made for
Standing in the downpour
Knowing that the sun will shine
Forget what lies behind you
Heaven walks beside you
You got to give it one more try
One more time
You just keep on reaching
You just keep on, you keep on moving
