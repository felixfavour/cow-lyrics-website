[Intro]
Son of God, we love You
Lift our gaze to You, Jesus
We're forever changed by You
Oh, I can't get enough
No, I can't get enough
Of Your amazing love
Jesus, I can't get enough
I can't walk away
No, I can't walk away
For I have seen Your face
And I can't walk away
And I just wanna be where You are
And I just wanna be near Your heart
There is nothing like Your love
Jesus, there is nothing like Your love
[Post-Chorus]
No, in the whole wide world
You have won my heart, Lord
Sing out your own song to Him
What is the song inside your heart to Him today?
He longs to hear it
