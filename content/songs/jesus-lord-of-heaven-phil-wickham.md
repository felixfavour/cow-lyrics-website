Jesus, Lord of Heaven, I do not deserve
The grace that You have given or the promise of Your word
Lord, I stand in wonder at the sacrifice You made
[Pre-Chorus]
With mercy beyond measure, my debt You freely paid
Your love is deeper than any ocean
Higher than the Heavens reaches beyond the stars in the sky
Jesus, Your love has no bounds
Jesus, Your love has no bounds
Jesus, Lord of Heaven, I do not deserve
The grace that You have given or the promise of Your word
Lord, I stand in wonder at the sacrifice You made
[Pre-Chorus]
With mercy beyond measure, my debt You freely paid
Your love is deeper than any ocean
Higher than the Heavens reaches beyond the stars in the sky
