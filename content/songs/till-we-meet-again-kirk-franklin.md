[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Thank you, Lord
We just wanna thank for God for what he's done
Thank you
Family, may his peace
[Chorus: The Family Choir & 
Kirk Franklin
]
May His peace be with you
Till we meet again
May His peace be with you
Till we meet again
(
Till we reach
) Till we reach that distant shore
(
And we'll shed
) And we'll shed a tear no more
May He give you strength to endure
Till we meet again
(
Till we meet, haha
) Till we meet again
May His peace be with you
Till we meet again
May His peace be with you
Till we meet again
Till we reach that distant shore
And we'll shed a tear no more
May He give you strength to endure
Till we meet again
Till we meet again
