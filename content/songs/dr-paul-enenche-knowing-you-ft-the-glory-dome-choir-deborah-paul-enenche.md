Knowing you is what
My Heart Desires
Knowing you is what I want to do
Knowing you
Is what my Heart Desires
Knowing you is what I want to do
Lord I want to Know you more
More than anything on Earth
Lead me by the hand Oh Lord
To your Holy Secret Place
Lord I want to Know you more
More than anything on Earth
Lead me by the hand Oh Lord
To your Holy Secret Place
{ Knowing you is what
My Heart Desires
Knowing you is what I want to do
Knowing you is what
My Heart Desires
I want to Know You more, Lord
Show me your Face, oh Lord
