Light up the way of Your heart
Move me like You do the mountains
Move me like You do the wind
And I'll chase Your voice through the dark
Fix my eyes on the unexpected
In the wonder of Your shadow-step
(Take another step)
You met me at the sinners' table
I found You waiting by the well
Unexpected
You are always there
Tracing all my steps
[Chorus:]
Light up the way of Your heart
Move me like You do the mountains
Move me like You do the wind
And I'll chase Your voice through the dark
Fix my eyes on the unexpected
In the wonder of Your shadow-step
(Take another step)
You never left the lost forsaken
Your mercy paves the road ahead
Unexpected
You are always good
You are always good
