Oye ye ye ye ye ye yeh
You're mighty God,
Mighty God
Oh ye ye ye ye ye ye oh

You are good
You are kind
You are more than these
Lost for words trying to describe

Elohim, Elyon, Aleselewi
Your greatness is all I have seen

There is nothing you cannot do
There's no mountain you cannot move

If You have said it and You will do it
You have a track record of keeping Your word
You are not about to stop doing it now

Olorun agbaye ooo
You are mighty

Olorun agbaye ooo
You are mighty ooo

S'ebi iwo lo f'oju orun ooo,
S'aso bora
S'ebi eyin lo f'oju orun, s'aso bora
Olorun agbaye ooo
(You are mighty)

By the blood that You shed, we have overcome, 
Discharged and acquitted for life
Then You gave us the right to Your Holy name
The scepter of Your power and strength

There is nothing You cannot change (Baba)
There is no mountain You cannot break

If You have said it and You will do it
You have a track record of keeping Your word
You're not about to stop doing it now

You are mighty ooo
You are mighty ooo
You are mighty ooo
You are mighty ooo

S'ebi iwo lo f'oju orun, s'aso bora
S'ebi eyin lo f'oju orun, s'aso bora
Olorun agbaye ooo
