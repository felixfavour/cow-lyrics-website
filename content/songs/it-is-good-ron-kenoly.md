It is good, it is good, it is good
To give thanks to the Lord on high
To sing of Your faithfulness and loving
Kindness both day and night
To play on our instruments
Sweet songs of praise for the things You do
It is good, it is good, it is good
To give thanks to You
For though the wicked spring up
Like the grass and are everywhere
Soon they will perish
But all those planted in your house
Will grow without end
Sing it again!
It is good, it is good, it is good
To give thanks to the Lord on high
To sing of Your faithfulness and loving
Kindness both day and night
To play on our instruments
Sweet songs of praise for the things You do
It is good, it is good, it is good
To give thanks to You
For though we struggle and trials
And troubles still come our way
You won't forsake us
Your word has told us
Your promises will never end
Sing it again!
