precious blood has left me forgiven
pure like the whitest of snow
powerful to make sin and shame retreat
this convenant is making me whole
so I will rise
and lift my head
for by his mercy
my life was spared
the highest name
has set me free
because of Jesus
my heart is clean
purify my heart in your presence
teach me to discover the joy
oh holiness that forms as you draw me close
in you what was lost is restored
so I will rise
and lift my head
for by his mercy
my life was spared
the highest name
has set me free
because of Jesus
my heart is clean
