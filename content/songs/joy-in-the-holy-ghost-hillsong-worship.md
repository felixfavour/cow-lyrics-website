I've found a friend, o Such a friend
He made my heart his home
God himself is with me
And I know I'm never alone
I know all my tomorrows will be better than all my hopes
We've got love grace peace and power
And joy in the Holy Ghost
(We've got love)
My God is never wrong
And He makes time for me
(We've got grace)
It blew apart my chains
And set the sinner free
(We've got peace)
It's like a river and you'll never run it dry
We've got power over fear and death
And hearts filled up with joy
The Holy Spirit fills me up
And I need him every day
For fire faith and confidence
And knowing what to say
I gave my heart and all I am
To the one who loves most
We've got love grace peace and power
And joy in the Holy Ghost
