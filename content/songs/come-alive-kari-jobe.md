You are great, yet You let us see Your face
You are strong, yet Your eyes are full of kindness
You are wise, but like a child You let us come
You are great, yet You let us see Your face
I come alive, I come alive
In Your presence, in Your presence
I come alive, I come alive
In Your presence, in Your presence
You are one, and Your love is unrestrained
You are pure, and Your holiness amazing
You are safe, and You lead us to Your heart
You are one, and Your love is unrestrained
I come alive, I come alive
In Your presence, in Your presence
I come alive, I come alive
In Your presence, in Your presence
I come alive, I come alive
In Your presence, in Your presence
I come alive, I come alive
In Your presence, in Your presence
