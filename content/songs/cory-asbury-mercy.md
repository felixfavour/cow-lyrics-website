(Jesus)
Mercy covers your throne
Like a rainbow, like a rainbow
Here I find myself in the sweetest embrace
With a love that I could never earn
And it's only in this place, that I am truly saved
Surrendered to beauty untold
Your mercy, it covers me wherever I go
Your kindness, it never ends, oh Lord
There's nothing I could do to change your mind
 About me
There's nothing I could do
Mercy flows from your throne
Like a river, like a river
Here I find myself in this healing embrace
With a love like I have never known
And it's only in this place, that I am truly saved
Surrendered to beauty untold
Your mercy, it covers me wherever I go
Your kindness, it never ends, oh Lord
There's nothing I could do to change your mind
God, there's nothing I could do to change your mind about me
There's nothing I can do
To keep you from loving me
To keep you from wanting me, Jesus
Your love it never fails
Your love it never fails
Your love it never fails me
Jesus
Your love will never fails
Hmmmmmm.
there's nothing I could do to change your mind about me
there's nothing I could do to change your mind
God there's nothing I could do to change your mind about me
God there's nothing I could do to change your mind
About me
You're a good, good Father
And you love your children
Slow to anger, abounding in love
You are so, so gracious
Oh so merciful
How he loves, how you love us so
