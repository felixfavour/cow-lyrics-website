You hold my every moment
You calm my raging seas
You walk with me through fire
And heal all my disease
[Pre-Chorus]
I trust in You
And I trust in You
And I believe that You're my healer
And I believe that You are all I need
And I believe that You're my portion
And I believe You're more than enough for me
Jesus, You're all I need
You hold my every moment
You calm my raging seas
You walk with me through fire
And heal all my disease
[Pre-Chorus]
And I trust in You
And I trust in You!
