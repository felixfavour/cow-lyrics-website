Trust in the Lord at all times
Pour out your heart before Him
Power belongeth to God
God has spoken once
And twice have I heard this
Power belongeth to God
Who can search His understanding
His thoughts higher than ours
All power's in His hands for my life He has a plan
God is our salvation
We find refuge in Him
Power belongs, power belongs to God
Great is our God Almighty
And He is strong at battle
Power belongs to our God
Although a host encamp me
Encamp and do surround me
Power belongs to our God
