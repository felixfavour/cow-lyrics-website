How lovely is
Your dwelling place
Oh Lord Almighty
My soul doth long
And even faint
For You
Here my heart
Is satisfied
Within Your presence
I see beneath
The shadow of
Your wings
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
Better is one day in Your courts
Better is one day in Your house
Better is one day in Your courts
Than thousands elsewhere
How lovely is
Your dwelling place
Oh Lord Almighty
My soul doth long
And even faint
For You
Here my heart
Is satisfied
Within Your presence
I see beneath
The shadow of
Your wings
