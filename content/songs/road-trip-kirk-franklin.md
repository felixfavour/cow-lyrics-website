[Intro]
One, two, three
Pack a smile, cause this road won't be easy
Doubt will come, believe me
Sometimes you'll wonder if it's alright
Hold on tight, it's about to be amazing
When you see what God is making
I can't wait for you to tell me that (it's alright)
Travel light and leave room for tomorrow, expect delays
And sorrow, avoid left turns, don't forget what's right
Pray always, listen to that voice above you
Only let folk ride that love you, see you've come too far
To not arrive on time
[Pre-Chorus]
But every time that you've been through
For His glory is using you
See it's only in the darkest night
That you really see the stars shine bright
So pack a smile, cause this road won't be easy
Doubt will come, believe me
Sometimes you'll wonder if it's alright
Hold on tight, it's about to be amazing
When you see what God is making
I can't wait for you to tell me that (it's alright)
