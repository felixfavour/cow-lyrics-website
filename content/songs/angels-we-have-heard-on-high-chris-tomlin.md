Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing over the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Gloria in Excelsis Deo
Gloria in Excelsis Deo
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ our Lord, the new born King
[Chorus][x2]
