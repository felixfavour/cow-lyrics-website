[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh (
Put your hands in the air for Cardec
)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
[Pre-Chorus]
I hear fifty five pull up to the city side, uh
That's the tricky side where they let the blicky fly up
Opps around me tryna get me t-t-t-t-tied up
Ain't no t-t-turnin' down 'cause the boy fired up, sheesh
Hold up, wait, hold up, wait, hold up, wait, hold up, wait
Hold up, wait, hold up, wait, hold up, wait
Walkin' in the Spirit, you know it get tricky 'round us
If they want the smoke, then tell 'em that we keep the fire, bruh
They told me that the revolution won't be televised ('Vised)
I just want the Kingdom, they can keep the enterprise ('Prise)
Everything we got is rented
, close the casket, nothing's in it
I just got the Tesla tinted, I can't take it to the finish, let me finish
Ain't no "Hol' up" when it come to God (Uh)
Either you leave or get left behind (Yeah)
You been set up, I been set aside (Sheesh)
Hop in his Uber, let's split a ride (Skrrt)
Look, I know that He beat it, I promise that death is defeated
Ain't no need to hold up the meetin'
They hold up they heater and after that, everything heated
Somebody gon' end up on t-shirt
I'm still outside on the block (Block)
I got some partners who lost (Yeah)
I'm tryna turn on they lights (Bling)
They like to walk in the dark (Woah)
I keep it a buck like I'm Giannis, I'm tryna be honest
The lessons I'm learnin', you can't get in college
They get in the street 'cause they can't get in college
That's why I'm like "Hol' up", I give you the knowledge
