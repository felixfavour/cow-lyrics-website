sought the Lord and He heard me
I sought the Lord and He heard my cry
I sought the Lord and He heard me
I sought the Lord and He heard my cry
And He answered me
Though weeping endures for the night
Your joy comes in the morning
Though sorrow may last for a time
Your joy comes in the morning
Faithful
You're always faithful
True
You're always true
You'll never leave me
You're always with me
You're good
You're good
I sought the Lord and He heard me
I sought the Lord and He heard my cry
And He answered me
Though weeping endures for the night
Your joy comes in the morning
Though sorrow may last for a time
Your joy comes in the morning
Faithful
You're always faithful
True
You're always true
You'll never leave me
You're always with me
You're good
You're good
You bring joy
You bring joy
You bring joy
You bring joy
You bring joy
You bring joy
To my soul
Faithful
You're always faithful
True
You're always true
You'll never leave me
You're always with me
You're good
You're good
