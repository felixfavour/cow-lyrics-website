This is a little song that the Lord gave to me to cheer you up
I just wanna tell you a little bit about my life
This is my story I just wanna tell you my story
I've been through hell on earth I've seen frustrations
But when I try and failed I just tried again Whitney
God on my side nothing is impossible
Come on
Cheer up
Cheer up
Cheer up Brother
Cheer up sister
You can make it
Come on
Cheer up
Cheer up
Don't you stay down
Wake up right now and Jesus will help you
I remember the three Hebrew Children down in the furnace
Daniel in the Lions den
It seemed the world was crushing on them
They cried to the Lord
They lifted there voices
And the Furnace became air conditioner Daniel had a lion for a pillow
Come on
Cheer up
Cheer up
Cheer up Brother
Cheer up sister
You can make it
Come on
Cheer up
Cheer up
Don't you stay down
Wake up right now and Jesus will help you
I have seen many trials in my life
But my God is not a man that He should lie
All the things He promised me He has done every one of them
And what so ever He says I know
He will do
He will do
Come on
Cheer up
Cheer up
Cheer up Brother
Cheer up sister
You can make it
Come on
Cheer up
Cheer up
Don't you stay down
Wake up right now and Jesus will help you yeeeaah
