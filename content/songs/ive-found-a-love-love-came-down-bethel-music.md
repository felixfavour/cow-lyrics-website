When I call on Your name You answer
When I fall You are there by my side
You delivered me out of darkness
Now I stand in the hope of new life
[Pre-Chorus]
And by grace I'm free
You've rescued me
Now all I am is Yours
I've found a love greater than life itself
I've found a hope stronger and nothing compares
I once was lost, now I'm alive in You
I'm alive in You, I'm alive in You
You're my God and my firm foundation
It is You whom I'll trust at all times
I give glory and praise, adoration
To my Saviour who's seated on high
I've found a love greater than life itself
I've found a hope stronger and nothing compares
I once was lost, now I'm alive in You
I've found a love greater than life itself
I've found a hope stronger and nothing compares
I once was lost, now I'm alive in You
Now I'm alive in You, now I'm alive in You
