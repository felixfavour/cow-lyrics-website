Holy, Holy, Holy
Lord God Almighty
Early in the morning
My song shall rise to thee
Holy, Holy, Holy
Merciful and mighty
God three persons, blessed trinity
Holy, Holy, Holy
All the saints adore thee
Casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea
All the cherubim and seraphim are falling down before Thee
Which wert and art evermore shalt be
Holy, Holy, Holy
Though the darkness hide Thee
Though the eyes of sinful man
Thy glory may not see
Lord, only Thou art holy and there is none beside Thee
Perfect in Power, in love and purity
Holy, Holy, Holy
Lord God almighty
All thy works shall praise Thy name in the earth and sky and sea
