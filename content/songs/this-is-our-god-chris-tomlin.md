A refuge for the poor
A shelter from the storm
This is our God
And He will wipe away your tears
And return your wasted years
This is our God
Oh, hmm, this is our God
Oh, hmm, this is our God
A father to the orphan
A healer to the broken
This is our God
And He brings peace to our madness
And comfort in our sadness
This is our God

This is the one we have waited for
This is the one we have waited for
This is the one we have waited for
Oh, this is our God
