[Intro]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
In my time I've travelled some roads
A rolling stone
Nowhere feels like home
I've seen people come, then they go
Life is just a story of some highs and some lows
[Pre-Chorus 1: Tori Kelly]
Tell me do you believe in miracles?
I'm standing here before your eyes
[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I've carried the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Everybody wants to be king
We put all our hope inside material things
In Your light I now understand
That everything I have ain't everything that I am
