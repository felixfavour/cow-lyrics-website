I see the state of the world and it grieves me
I hear the cries of the broken of the rich and poor
Smell the fear of disease all around me now
I feel responsible now that I see
Cause we all approve to live for more than this
More than this
So I want to love like love
Love like you love want to love others
The way you love me
So I want to love like love
Love like you love want to love others
The way you love me
I've held the children unseen and they move me
I wonder what I can do to improve a thousand lives
I feel the absence of love and it scares me
I feel responsible now that I see
Cause we all were born to live for more than this
So much more than this
So I want love like you love
Love like you love, want to love others
The way you love me
