faith has found a resting place
Not in device nor creed
I trust the Ever-living One
His wounds for me shall plead
Enough for me that Jesus saves
This ends my fear and doubt
A sinful soul I come to Him
He'll never cast me out
I need no other argument
I need no other plea
It is enough that Jesus died
And that He died for me
My heart is leaning on the Word
The written Word of God
Salvation by my Savior's name
Salvation through His blood
I need no other argument
I need no other plea
It is enough that Jesus died
And that He died for me
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
I need no other argument
I need no other plea
It is enough that Jesus died
And that He died for me
