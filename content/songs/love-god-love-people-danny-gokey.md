I've been running in circles
Jumping the hurdles
Getting caught in that rush of doing so much
I'm feeling kinda worn out
All this checking the boxes
Trying to be flawless
Has me spinning my head, catching my breath
Too afraid to slow down
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I tell myself to keep this up
That God wants more than just my love
But I've been complicating things
It's just like me to overthink
Gotta keep it real simple, keep it real simple
Bring everything right back to ground zero
'Cause it all comes down to this
Love God and love people (People)
We're living in a world that keeps breakin'
But if we want to find a way to change it
It all comes down to this
Love God and love people
