[Chorus]
Star of wonder
Star of light
Star with royal
Beauty bright
Westward leading
Still proceeding
Guide us to Thy perfect light
Guide us to Thy perfect light
God of wonder
God of light
God is with us
Here tonight
Holy Savior
In this manger
Come to set the world to right
Come to set the world to right
[Hook]
Oh-yeah (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
