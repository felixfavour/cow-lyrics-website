One thing I desire
One thing I seek
To gaze upon Your beauty
And Your Majesty
God of my salvation
Lifter of my head
Teach me how to live oh Lord
And Your righteousness
[Pre-Chorus]
So I pray to You
So I pray to You
Lord, Your name
Is higher than the heavens
Lord, Your name
Is higher than all created things
Higher than hope
Higher than dreams
The name of the Lord
In the days of trouble
You cover me
In the secret place of refuge
Lord, I will sing
