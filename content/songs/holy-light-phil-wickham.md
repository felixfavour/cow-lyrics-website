We have come, and now we will wait
For Your love to move
For Your light to break
Start a movement here, as we call Your name
Let Your glory fall like a holy rain
[Pre-Chorus]
Dead arise, hearts be awakened
And in this light, Earth will be shaken
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, yeah!
God, who reigns over earth and sky
Flood this world with Your holy light
Start a fire that will never die
Flood this world with Your holy light
Every knee will bow
Every eye will see
Everyone will shout, "Jesus Christ is King"[Pre-Chorus]
Slave run free, chains be broken
Darkness flee, eyes be open
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, yeah-yeah!
