Took a step in the night, didn't know I was ready
Took a shot in the dark but I knew You would show me
Put my feet on the path but I'm stepping in your shadow
Not sure where to land but I knew how to follow
But as long as I can see Your footsteps, I'm all right
I know that I can see Your footsteps, I'm all right
You're my guiding light, light, light
You show me the way and I hit the ground running
Every step that I took didn't know what was coming
When the days got long and the road got narrow
I remember what you said that I'd never be alone
But as long as I can see Your footsteps, I'm all right
I know that I can see Your footsteps, I'm all right
You're my guiding light, light, light
You're my guiding light, light, light
Light, light
[Bridge]
No, I'm not turning back even when the fight comes
Keep pressing on, keep pressing on, keep pressing on
No, I'm not looking back even in the battle
I keep pressing on, keep pressing on, keep pressing on, yeah
