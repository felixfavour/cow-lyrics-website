Draw me close to You
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear You say that I'm Your friend
You are my desire
No one else will do
No onle else can take Your place
To feel the warmth of Your embrace
Help me find my way
Bring me back to You
Chorus:
You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know You are near
You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know You are near (x3)
Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To the cross where Thou hast died
Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord
To Thy preciuos bleeding side
