Who else would rocks cry out to worship?
Whose glory taught the stars to shine?
Perhaps creation longs to have the words to sing
But this joy is mine
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
Who else would die for our redemption?
Whose resurrection means I’ll rise?
There isn’t time enough to sing of all You’ve done
But I have eternity to try
With a thousand hallelujahs
We magnify Your name
You alone deserve the glory
The honor and the praise
Lord Jesus
This song is forever Yours
A thousand hallelujahs
And a thousand more
