Every time I come running, I find grace on repeat
You welcome me with open arms, no matter where I have been
Every time I surrender, every time I fall
I find grace more precious than I did before
So I'm gonna lay my world down here at Your feet
Look to the Heavens for all I need
I'm gonna sing my heart out, praise on repeat
To the God who's never given up on me
You're the mеrcy at midnight, You're the kindness of dawn
My hopе in every waking hour and the strength I lean on
Every time it comes to sundown and the night sets in
Let my soul remember just how good You've been
And again and again, my heart will sing
I'm gonna lay my world down here at Your feet
Look to the Heavens for all I need
I'm gonna sing my heart out, praise on repeat
To the God who's never given up on me
'Cause You're the God who's never giving up on me
