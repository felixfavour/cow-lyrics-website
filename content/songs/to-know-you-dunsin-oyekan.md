Just one passion, one purpose
To know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
Just one passion, one purpose
To know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
No life outside You
No one besides You
Let me know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
Everybody say, "Just one passion"Just one passion, one purpose
To know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
Somebody make that your heart be heard
Just one passion, one purpose
To know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
No life outside You
No one besides You
Let me know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
Say, "Just one passion"Just one passion, one purpose
To know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
Somebody make that your prayer tonight, say
Just one passion, one purpose
To know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
No life outside You
No one besides You
Let me know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
Lift your voice say, "No life"No life outside You (a life without Jesus is a waste)
No one besides You
Let me know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
Lift your voice and say, "No life"No life outside You
No one besides You
Let me know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
No life outside You
No one besides You
Let me know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
As the musicians begin to prophesy
Somebody express your appetite
I want to know You more
I want to know You more
I want to know You more
Life without You is a waste
Life without You is a waste
Life without You...
Let me know
Lift your voice say, "No life outside You"No life outside You
No one besides You
Let me know You more and more (there are depths you go in God)
When I know You, I'll find me (there are depths you go in God)
For the wonders of God are for those who step in deep waters
No life outside You
No one besides You
Let me know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
Somebody tell Him, say, "Let me know You"Let me know You more and more (when I know You Jesus)
When I know You, I'll find me (that's when I start living)
Say, "Let me know You Lord"Let me know You more and more
This is the essence of life, when I know You
When I know You, I'll find me
Somebody say it like this, say, "I want to know You"I want to know You more and more (when I know You Jesus)
When I know You, I'll find me
Some of you have not started living yet, I want to know You
I want to know You more and more
Let today be your birth day, the day you know Jesus
When I know You, I'll find me (that's the day you'll start living)
The day You find Jesus, that's the day you'll start living
I want to know You more and more
Jacob met Him and his life changed forever
When I know You, I'll find me (one more time)
Say, "I want to know You"I want to know You more and more
When I know You, I'll find me
