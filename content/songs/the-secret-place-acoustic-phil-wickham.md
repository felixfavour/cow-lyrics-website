Where will you run my soul?
Where will you go when wells run dry?
When the wind starts to blow
How you gonna keep this flame alive?
[Pre-Chorus]
In the fading light when night is breaking
I know You will always be waiting
You'll always be there
I'm running to the secret place
Where You are, where You are
I'll sing to You of all the ways
You stole my heart, stole my heart
Better is a moment that I spend with You
Than a million other days away
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running to the secret place
[Interlude]
Oooh oooh, o-o-o-o-ooh
Oooh oooh, o-o-o-o-ooh
You are my only hope
You are the rock on which I stand
And You will not let me go
I know that I'm safe inside Your hands
