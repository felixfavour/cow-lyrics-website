Silent night holy night
All is calm all is bright
Round yon virgin
Mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly host sing hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born
I love You Lord I worship You
Hope which was lost now stands renewed
I give my life to honour this
The love of Christ the Saviour King
I love You Lord I worship You
Hope which was lost now stands renewed
I give my life to honour this
The love of Christ the Saviour King
