ld somebody
Tell him that you love him
Lift your hands together
And praise the Lord
(Everybody come) Hold somebody
Tell him that you love him (I love you)
Lift your hands together
And praise the Lord
What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and grief to bear
What a privilege we have to carry
Everything to God in prayer
Hold somebody
Tell him that you love him
Lift your hands together
And praise the Lord
(Everybody come) Hold somebody
Tell him that you love him (I love you)
Lift your hands together
And praise the Lord
Have we trials and temptation
If there's trouble anywhere
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in prayer
Hold somebody
Tell him that you love him (I love you)
Lift your hands together
And praise the Lord
(Everybody come) Hold somebody
Tell him that you love him (I love you)
Lift your hands together
And praise the Lord
