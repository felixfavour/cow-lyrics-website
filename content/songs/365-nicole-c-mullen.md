I'd like to see you more than on just holidays
'Cause I really miss you
When Christmas is so far away
Love like a snowflake
Catch it before it's too late
And if I could freeze time, this season
Would come every day
'Cause I would love for Christmas to stay 365 days
No one dear would be far away
Love would be the gift we gave 365 days
The laughter of children
More food than I'll ever taste
Good friends and family surround me as I celebrate
God in a manger and miracles that we attain
I pray that this yеar good will and peace would remain
'Causе I would love for Christmas to stay 365 days
No one dear would be far away
Love would be the gift we gave 365 days
