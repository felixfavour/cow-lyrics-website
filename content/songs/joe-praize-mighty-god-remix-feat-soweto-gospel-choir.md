Oh Lord, my God, Jesus
I'll speak of You Glory,
I will show forth Your beauty
If I dance it wont be enough,
If I shout it wont be enough
I'll speak of You Glory,
I will show forth Your beauty
If I dance it wont be enough,
If I shout it wont be enough
For You are the great and mighty King
You rule in every nation
On Christ the solid rock,
You are worthy to be praised
You are Alpha and Omega, I worship You today
In You I put my trust, You name I will extol
Heaven speaks of Your glory
And the earth of Your beauty
Your love is new every morning
And Your faithfulness is ever sure
Heaven speaks of Your glory
And the earth of Your beauty
Your love is new every morning
And Your faithfulness is ever sure
For You are the great and mighty God
So worthy to be praised
Your beautiful for all situation
You are the joy of the whole world
(Siyakudumisa (I worship You))
