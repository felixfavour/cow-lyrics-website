VERSE 1:
Great is Your love
Let the whole earth sing
Let the whole earth sing
You reached for us
From on heaven's throne
When we had no hope
PRE-CHORUS 1:
You are the way
There is no other
You are the way
There is no other
CHORUS:
You rose from death to victory
You reign in life
Oh majesty
Your name be high and lifted up
Jesus, Jesus alive in us
VERSE 2:
You outshine the sun
You are glorious
You are glorious
Lord over all
You have made us new
We owe it all to You
