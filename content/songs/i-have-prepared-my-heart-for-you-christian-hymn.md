I have prepared my heart for You;
O Lord come take Your Throne,
Nothing must come within my soul,
Nothing must break into my thoughts,
No one must rise to take Your place,
O Lord, come take Your Throne.

I have reserved my lifetime for You;
O Lord come take control,
My life must serve Your purpose Lord,
Living for You and dying to self,
My all I give Your will to serve,
O Lord come take control.

I have released my whole being to You;
O Lord come take Your own
My heart, my soul and body, Lord!
Once and for all and not bit by bit;
I lay them all on the alter for You;
O Lord come take Your own.

I have referred my life's end to You,
Dear Lord, then take me home,
To see thy face is all I ask
My Labour here must not be in vain.
My hope, my joy is to reign with You
O may i make it home.
