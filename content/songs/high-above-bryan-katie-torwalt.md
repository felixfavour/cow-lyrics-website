We turn our hearts and fix our eyes
We welcome You, arms open wide
And feel the light of heaven
Let every soul arise and wake
Lift a song, prepare the way
We feel the light of heaven
One heart, one voice
We lift You up, we lift You up
Our hope, our joy
We lift You up, we lift You up
High above
God, Your light has come
Overwhelmed, we stand in awe
Words fall short of all You are
Behold the King of heaven
One heart, one voice
We lift You up, we lift You up
Our hope, our joy
We lift You up, we lift You up
High above
God, Your light has come
