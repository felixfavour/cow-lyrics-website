Peace be still You are with me
In this hope I abide
Jesus be my sustainer
Strengthen me in this trial
And I know, it's only for a moment
And everything is working, for Your glory
But I need, Your perfect love to hold me
Safe within Your promise
'Til the storm has passed
When this burden is lifted
I'll give praise to Your name
But until it is finished
I'll give praise just the same
And I know, it's only for a moment
And everything is working, for Your glory
But I need, Your perfect love to hold me
Safe within Your promise
'Til the storm has passed
