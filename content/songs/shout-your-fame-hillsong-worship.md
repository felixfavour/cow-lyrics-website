Some say You're just a good man
Some say You were kind
Some say You are in the grave
But I say You're alive
Some say You're just a prophet
Some say You were wise
Some say You were just a man
But I say You are God
You are my God
I will shout Your fame to all the earth
I will lift Your name on high
And the world will know Your greatness
You are my God, I will shout Your fame
I know You're the Messiah
You gave Your life for me
And I know You're the only way
Jesus You are God
You are my God
I will shout Your fame to all the earth
I will lift Your name on high
I will show the world Your greatness
You are my God, Jesus
