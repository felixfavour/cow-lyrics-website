HALLOWED BE YOUR NAME
(Matthew 6, 9)
Holy Holy Lord
You're worthy
And I'm honored
To sing Your praise
King of Glory God Almighty
Hallowed be Your name
All creation every nation
Has its being by Your word
As Your will is done up in heaven
Let it be done here on earth
Let it be done on earth
Hallowed be Your name
Hallowed be Your name
Hallowed be Your name
Lord and majesty
Divine authority
Hallowed be Your name
(Repeat)
Holy Holy Lord
You're worthy
And I'm honored
to sing Your praise
King of Glory God Almighty
Hallowed be Your name
Hallowed be Your name
(Repeat chorus)
Hallowed be Your name
