All the money that the world could hold
Mountains made of solid gold
Riches that could buy my dreams
You are better than all these things
The prettiest face to turn their eyes
Beauty that could hypnotize
The open doors that looks may bring
You are better than all these things
'Cause Your love is better than life
You are the well that won't run dry
I have tasted and I have seen
Oh, that You are better than all these things
Power that could shake the moon
The most important one in every room
Status matched by only kings
You are better than all these things
'Cause Your love is better than life
You are the well that won't run dry
I have tasted and I have seen
Oh, that You are better than all these things
'Cause Your love is better than life
You are the well that won't run dry
I have tasted and I have seen
Oh, that You are better than all these things
That You are better than all these things
Yes, You
