I don't see anything wrong with the lights or stages
I even love it when the crowd gets loud singing out God's praises
But every now and then, it can get a little complicated
So I remember when I was in that old church basement, singing
Hallelujah is all I need
When I think of Your goodness and Your love for me
Oh, the joy of my salvation, is coming back to me
It's just an old hallelujah with a new melody
[Post-Chorus]
And I'm singing
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah
We got together every Wednesday night, about thirty teenagers
My friend Josh bought a cheap guitar and barеly knew how to play it
He wasn't putting on a show, wasn't well known, wasn't trying to bе famous
But we sure touched Heaven in that old church basement
Hallelujah is all I need
When I think of Your goodness and Your love for me
Oh, the joy of my salvation, is coming back to me
It's just an old hallelujah with a new melody
