Don't you stand there like God's not a miracle worker
He's working a miracle right now
Somebody beside you don't undertand your praise, but I want you to grab somebody around you that don't mind praising and I want you to hit the floor right now
See some of y'all looking around
You gotta understand something
That when you've really been through something
Some of you been through enough hell that you owe God a shout tonight
I figured we may as well leave him the praise that he's due
Some people can't understand your praise, but tell them this
Repeat(x4)
If you've been through what I've been through, you would be Praising too
All night (all night)
All night (all night)
Clap your hands (all night)
Do your dance (all night)
He's still here (all night)
Making a way (all night)
He's a mighty God (all night)
He's a mighty God (all night)
I can dance (all night)
All night (all night)
I can dance (all night)
All night (all night)
Give God glory (all night)
All night (all night)
He's so worthy (all night)
Yes he is (all night)
Yes (all night)
All night all night)
Give him a praise (all night)
All night(all night)
Miracle worker (all night)
All night
He's a mighty God
Soul saver
Some of y'all ought to get in these ilse
You ought to praise him right now
Somebody ought to dance right now
Don't let nothing stop you right now
The devil hates your praise
The devil hates your dance
Repeat (x3)
To God be the Glory
Repeat (x4)
For all the things he's done
Repeat (x3)
I, I got a praise. I got a praise and I gotta get it out
I want the devil to know that God is the greatest power
He shall not be defeated
(Testimony)
