(Once upon a time)
Once upon a time
I was faithless, running blind
Through the valley of the lost
So now you find it rather strange
When you hear me claim the name
Of the one who bears the cross
And I say
I believe in You now
A new light is showing me how
I used to walk in the shadows of doubt
But I believe in You now
(Will there ever)
Will there ever come a day
When you follow in the way
Of the truth that sets you free
To where the thunder of a voice
And the echo of a choice
Will bring you to your knees
No longer running through the night
A conversion to the light
Giving way to disbelief
