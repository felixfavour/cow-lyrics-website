Oh, yeah
I gotta move, I gotta
I gotta go
I gotta
I gotta go y'all, I gotta go
I gotta
But I feel that it's about two hundred people in here that needs to give God a praise
Because all I needed was a reminder
I needed, I needed one good reminder
One good reminder, that this heaviness does not have control over my mind
I loose God's people's mind
I said loose God's people's mind
Okay, we not warming up, we not warming up
I don't need a warmup
They used to say, when I think of the goodness of Jesus and all
All He's donе for me, I see ya sis
My soul cries out, Hallelujah
Somеbody get your feet off the ground and give God
It's under my feet
This is what you will say, It's under my Feet
It's under my feet
It's under my feet
It's under my feet
Somebody say it, it's under my feet
Somebody say it, it's under my feet
Somebody shout it out, it's under my feet
Somebody shout it out, it's under my feet
Whatever it is
It's under my feet
It's under my feet, it's under my feet
