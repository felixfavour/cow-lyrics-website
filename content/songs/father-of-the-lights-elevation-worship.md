I don’t thank you near enough
For all the little things you’ve done
Lord forgive me when I’ve been too familiar with your love
Cause you gave me 12 notes and the breath in my lungs and I’m gonna praise you with this one
Chorus:
Every good thing in my life
Comes down from the father of lights
It Comes down from the father
Down from the father
Down from the father of lights
All the best things in this world
Money just can’t buy
It comes down from the father
Down from the father
Down from the father of lights
I remember where I was
Out of strength nowhere to run
Oh I’m so glad that you ran to me and picked me up
And you gave me 12 notes and the breath in my lungs and I’m gonna praise you with this one
Bridge:
If the world didn’t give
The world can’t take it away
