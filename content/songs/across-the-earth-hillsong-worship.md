Across the earth
Your praises rise
We lift our voice
Call upon Your Name
You gave us hope
That never ends
In Christ alone
The victory remains
[Pre-Chorus]
For You are great and mighty
Let the nations sing
Your praise fills the heavens
For You have redeemed us
Our hope is in You alone
The cross has released us
To sing of Your freedom
By grace You make all things new
You came to us
To save our lives
The love of God
Was seen upon the cross
You rose again
The glory Yours
The highest praise belongs to You alone
