"Isaiah Song"
(feat. Chandler Moore & Aaron Moses)
This is the Word of the Lord, your Creator
I am the God who stood before the world was framed
I am the First, the Last, and everything between
I hold your future, who could know these things but Me?
So don't fear
I will be Your song
Sing, sing, oh barren land
Water is coming to the thirsty
Though you are empty, I am the well
Draw from me, I will provide
This is the Word of the Lord, your Creator
I stand from age to age, the Ancient of Days
I am the Holy One, the Fairest of Ten Thousand
And all who call upon My name shall be saved
So don't fear
I will be Your song
Sing, sing, oh barren land
Water is coming to the thirsty
Though you are empty, I am the well
Draw from me, I will provide
I'm a river in the desert
Pouring my spirit on the broken
Giving beauty for your ashes
Joy for your sadness and mourning
Heavens open
He's making ways in the wilderness
He's making rivers in the desert
You're making ways in the wilderness
You're making rivers in the desert
You are the way in the wilderness
You are the river in the desert
No more dry ground
No more dry ground
Heaven's open
No more dry ground
Heaven's open
Sing, sing, oh barren land
Water is coming to the thirsty
Though you are empty, I am the well
Draw for me, I will provide
I might be empty, but He is the Well
I might be empty, but He is the Well
Draw from me, I will provide
What was a barren season is giving birth right now
What was a barren season is giving birth right now
Every barren season is giving birth right now
My emptiness is my offering
My weakness is all I have to bring
Do You love that?
You're doing something new right now
So don't fear
I will be Your song
Sing, sing, oh barren land
Water is coming to the thirsty
Though you are empty, I am the well
Draw from me, I will provide
