It's complicated, it always is
That's just the way it goes
Feels like I waited so long for this
I wonder if it shows
Head under water, now I can't breathe
It never felt so good
Cause I can feel it coming over me
I wouldn't stop it if I could
When love takes over (yeah, ah, yeah)
You know you can't deny
When love takes over (yeah, ah, yeah)
'Cause something's here tonight
Give me a reason, I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Can't you see me here all alone
And this time I blame you
Looking out for you to hold my hand
It feels like I could fall
Now love me right, like I know you can
We could lose it all
When love takes over (yeah, ah, yeah)
You know you can't deny
When love takes over (yeah, ah, yeah)
'Cause something's here tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
