I've been living just because you live.
I'm still breathing just 'cause you breathe through me
My security, in you I live and move
You protect me every night and day
I love you dearly
You are the reason creation bow

Idighi Agbanwe, agbanwe
(You never Change)
Idighi Agharipu
(You never Disappoint)
Idi Omimi (You are so Deep)
You alone are God
We Worship You
We Bless your Name
Alpha and Omega, I give you Praise
Verse 2
You are Jehovah that will never change
Unchanging one who changes everything

Thank you Father for fighting over me
