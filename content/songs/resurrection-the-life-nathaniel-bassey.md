How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds
And drives away his fear
It makes the wounded spirit whole
And calms the troubled breast
'Tis manna to the hungry soul
And to the weary rest
Dear Name! the Rock on which I build
My shield and hiding-place
My never-failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace
Jesus, My Shepherd, Guardian, Friend
My Prophet, Priest, and King
My Lord, My Life, My Way, My End
Accept thе praise we bring
Weak is thе effort of our heart
And cold our warmest thought
But when we see Thee as Thou art
We'll praise Thee as we ought
Till then we would Thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath
And triumph in that blessed Name
Which quells the power  of death
