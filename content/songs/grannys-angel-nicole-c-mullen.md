He was standing on the corner again
While she was praying for God to forgive his sin
And out of nowhere, two inches of lead
To him it's still a mystery, how the bullet missed his head?
But granny cried, "Lord Jesus, help my baby boy
'Cause he ain't doin' the things that he's supposed to," yeah, yeah
Then she cried, "Lord Jesus, it would bring me joy
To see him live to be someone who loves you"
'Cause you can't keep livin' on granny's Angel
See it's about time you get one of your own
I'm telling you can't keep livin' on granny's Angel
'Cause whatcha gonna do when granny's gone
Stuck in traffic at a quarter 'til nine
Shirley's cursing, oops that fatal wreck on my side
No compassion 'cause she don't realize
Had she been any earlier, boom it would have been her life
But this is what happened
But Granny cried, "Lord Jesus, help my baby girl
To do the things she knows that she's supposed to"
Then she cried, "Lord Jesus, it would mean the world
To see her live to be someone who loves you"
