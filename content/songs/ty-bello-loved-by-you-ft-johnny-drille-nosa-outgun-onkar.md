You never leave me
No never leave me
No never leave me
Never leave me
The way that You love me
The way that You cover me
How You led me through the storms
Oh, how You lead me through it all God
The way that You love me
Through the den of the lion
You are with me
Nda nda ande
I went through the fire in Your embrace.
Ooooo
I'm adored by You
I love to hide in You
How beautiful it is to be loved by You.
E e e e eh
I am loved by You.
I'm adored by You.
Face to face with You.
How beautiful it is to be loved by You.
How it blows my mind,
That You call me friend.
But You gave me life.
Love me until the end of time.
So loved by Yaweh o.
He is never far away
Never leave me no way o.
You never leave me lonely
I am loved by You

I'm adored by You
(how wonderful it is to be loved by You).
Face to face with You

How beautiful it is to be loved by You

Never without You.
