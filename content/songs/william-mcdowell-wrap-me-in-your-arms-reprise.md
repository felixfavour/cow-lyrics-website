So many times we struggle and we labour We try to find that sense of peace that sense of security But we already heard his word, he has already invited us Some of you You you've been longing to experience the presence of God You been longing to have an encounter with God But if you would just in this moment lift your hands one more time I want you to know that our father is here He knows everything There's nothing that happens in your world that catches him by surprise He sees every tear He sees every night Up worriying Pacing the floor Crying out to him for his presence Some of you just want him- just show me you are real I need you But I want you to know that your father is here To embrace you in this moment To take away every fear and every concern All you have to do is ask him
