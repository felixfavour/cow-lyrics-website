Hark the herald angels sing, glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise, join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark the angels sing
Hark the angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
[Interlude]
Christ by highest heaven adored, Christ the everlasting Lord
Late in time behold Him come, offspring of a virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the God-head see, hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with man to dwell, Jesus our Emmanuel
Hark the angels sing
Hark the angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
[Interlude]
