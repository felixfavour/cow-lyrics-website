Jesus . . shall reign
Where're the sun
Doth his successive journeys run
His kingdom stretch
From shore to shore
Till Sun shall rise and set no more.
Jesus . . shall reign
Where're the sun
Doth his successive journeys run
His kingdom stretch
From shore to shore
Till Sun shall rise and set no more.
In the Cross, In the Cross
Be my Glory ever
Till my Rapture soul shall find
Rest beyond the River
In the Cross, In the Cross
Be my Glory ever
Till my Rapture soul shall find
Rest beyond the River
In the Cross, In the Cross
Be my Glory ever
Till my Rapture soul shall find
Rest beyond the River
My hope is built on nothing else
Than Jesus' blood of and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.
On Christ the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand
 My hope is built on nothing else
Than Jesus' blood of and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.
On Christ the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand
My faith has found a resting place
Not in device or creed
I trust the ever living one
His wounds shall plead for me.
       I need no other Argument
       I need no other plea
       It is enough that Jesus died
       And that he died for me.
Guide me o thou  great Jehovah
Pilgrim through this this barren land;
I am weak, but thou art mighty
Hold me with thou powerful hand
        Bread of Heaven
        Bread of Heaven
        Feed me till I want no more
        Bread of Heaven
        Bread of Heaven
        Feed me till I want no more
Guide me o thou  great Jehovah
Pilgrim through this this barren land;
I am weak, but thou art mighty
Hold me with thou powerful hand
        Bread of Heaven
        Bread of Heaven
        Feed me till I want no more
        Bread of Heaven
        Bread of Heaven
        Feed me till I want no more
        Bread of Heaven
        Bread of Heaven
        Feed me till I want no more
        Bread of Heaven
        Bread of Heaven
        Feed me till I want no more
        Strong deliverer
        Strong deliverer
        Feed me till I want no more
        Bread of Heaven
        Bread of Heaven
        Feed me till I want no more
        Bread of Heaven
        Bread of Heaven
        Feed me till I want no more
