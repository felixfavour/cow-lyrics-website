[Intro]
(Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-ooh)
(Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-ooh)
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant, so tender and mild (Oh-oh)
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace (Oh-oh, oh)
[Hook]
(Oh-oh, oh, oh-ooh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-ooh)
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly Hosts sing, "Alleluia!"Christ, the Savior is born
Christ, the Savior is born (Oh-oh, oh)
[Hook]
(Oh-oh, oh, oh-ooh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-ooh)
