The cross has the final word
The cross has the final word
Sorrow may come in the darkest night
But the cross has the final word
The cross has the final word
The cross has the final word
Evil may put up its strongest fight
But the cross has the final word
The cross has the final word
The cross has the final word
The Saviour has come with the morning light
The cross has the final word
The cross has the final word
The cross has the final word
He traded death for eternal life
The cross has the final word
[Bridge]
There's nothing stronger, nothing higher
Nothing greater, than the Name of Jesus
All the honour, all the power
All the glory to the Name of Jesus
There's nothing stronger, nothing higher
Nothing greater, than the Name of Jesus
All the honour, all the power
All the glory to the Name of Jesus
