Yes I'm glad
My heart is calm
You're my peace
I can't be moved
Like Zion's hill
My feet are still
Oh Yes I'm glad
My heart is calm
You're my peace
I can't be moved
Like Zion's hill
My feet are still
Cos I am surrounded by You
Oh Yes I'm glad
My heart is calm
You're my peace
I can't be moved
Like Zion's hill
My feet are still
Yes I'm glad
My heart is calm
You're my peace
I can't be moved
Like Zion's hill
My feet are still
Chorus
You are my God
You are my God
You are my God
You're my peace
You are my strength
You are my hope
Jesus
In you I trust
In you I trust
In you I trust
You're my peace
You are my strength
You are my hope
YEAHâ¦.
