Your word is a sword from my mouth
I'm telling fear it has to go
Your promise is my solid ground
I'm standing strong on anchored hope
[Pre-Chorus]
This mountain that is rising up in front of me
Will fall into the sea
The God who conquered death for all eternity
Is now my victory
You never fail to be faithful
You never fail to be faithful
I'm full of faith, You'll make a way because
You never fail to be faithful
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh
You love the impossible things
They lead the way to miracles
So, I'm looking doubt in the face
It has to bow to Christ my hope
