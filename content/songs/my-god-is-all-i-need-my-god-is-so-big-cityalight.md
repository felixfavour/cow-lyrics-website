Dark, dark is the valley
Faint, the light at my feet
But whatever may face me
My God is all I need
Bright, bright are the treasures
Life may offer to me
But whatever the pleasure
My God is all I need
He is my strength when I cannot go on
Peace when all my power is gone
Hope, although the night is long and deep
He is my song for He has rescued me
Joy now He has set me free
Praise! Praise to my Father be
My God is all I need
Brief, brief are my days here
Soon my journey complete
But I look to my Saviour
Where God has met my need
Yes, He has met my need
He is my strength when I cannot go on
Peace when all my power is gone
Hope, although the night is long and deep
He is my song for He has rescued me
Joy now He has set me free
Praise! Praise to my Father be
My God is all I need
My God is so big, so strong and so mighty
There's nothing my God cannot do
My God is so big, so strong and so mighty
There's nothing my God cannot do
The mountains are His, the valleys are His
The stars are His handiwork too
My God is so big, so strong and so mighty
There's nothing my God cannot do
My God is so big, so strong and so mighty
There's nothing my God cannot do
My God is so big, so strong and so mighty
There's nothing my God cannot do
The mountains are His, the valleys are His
The stars are His handiwork too
My God is so big, so strong and so mighty
There's nothing my God cannot do
There's nothing my God cannot do
He is my strength when I cannot go on
Peace when all my power is gone
Hope, although the night is long and deep
He is my song for He has rescued me
Joy now He has set me free
Praise! Praise to my Father be
My God is all I need
Praise! Praise to my Father be
My God is all I need
