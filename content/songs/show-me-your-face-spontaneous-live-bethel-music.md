Emmanuel my King
What a price You paid for love
Just for love, just for love
What a price You paid for love, for love, for love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
What a price You paid for love (What a price You paid)
You paid a debt You did not owe
I owe a debt I did not pay
But here’s my heart, here’s my heart
Here’s my life, here’s my life (It was a price You paid)
Here’s my everything (Here’s my all, my everything)
Here’s my heart, here’s my heart
And here’s my life, here’s my life
You can have it all (You can have it all, You can have it)
Oh-oh-oh-ooh how great Your love (How great Your love)
How great Your love
So here I am returning what’s Yours, here I am
Here I am returning what’s Yours, here I am
Oh God here I am returning what’s Yours, here I am
Here I am, here I am (Here I am, here I am)
Just give yourself to the Lord
Oh, You can have it all
Here I am returning what’s Yours, here I am, here I am
You paid the price for me, for me, for me
How great is Your love, how great
Oh, how great, how great, how great
