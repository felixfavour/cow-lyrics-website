Let praise be a weapon that silences the enemy
And let praise be a weapon that conquers all anxiety
Let it rise, let praise arise
We sing Your name in the dark and it changes everything
We sing with all we are and we claim Your victory
Let it rise, let praise arise (
Alright, come on now, here we go
)
We'll see You break down every wall
We'll watch the giants fall
Fear cannot survive when we praise You
The God of breakthrough's on our side
Forever lift Him high
With all creation cry, "God, we praise You"Oh, we praise You
Oh (
Alright, come on, let faith
)
Let faith be the song that overcomes the raging sea
And let faith be the song that calms the storm inside of me
Let it rise, let faith arise
Let it rise
We'll see You break down every wall
We'll watch the giants fall
Fear cannot survive when we praise You
The God of breakthrough's on our side
Forever lift Him high
With all creation cry, "God, we praise You" (
Just sing
)
Oh, we praise You
Oh (
Alright, come on, this is
