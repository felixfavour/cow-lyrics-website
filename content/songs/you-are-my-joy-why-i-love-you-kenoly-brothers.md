You are so special to me
You are my everything
You are the only reason why I sing
I can't explain the way I feel
'Cause your love is all so real
I never felt this way before
You are my joy
You are my laughter
You are my happiness
That's why I love You
Oh Lord never thought someone could give
All the love that you gave
You are the only reason why I live
That's why I want to do all
That I can to show my love
To You in all I do
You are my joy
You are my laughter
You are my happiness
That's why I love You
You are my joy
You are my laughter
You are my happiness
And that's why I love You
