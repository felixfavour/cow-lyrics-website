There's a passion in my heart
And a burden in my Spirit
It is for my generation
Are We Living According To His Plan?
There's A Plan And Purpose For Every Man
There's A Calling For Greater Harvest
God Is Calling Will You Answer
Will You Walk On This Journey Of Faith?
Chorus
We're On The Train Going To Heaven
We're On The Journey Of Faith
And When Our Life Here Is Over
We Will Answer To God
This Is A Train Of Glory
This Is A Journey Of Joy
Cause When Our Work Here Is Over
We Will Hear Well Done
Verse 2
There's A Picture In My Heart
An Expectation In My Spirit
On And One And Final Day
I Will See On Your Face Many Smiles
It Will Be A Day Of Joy
But For Some A Day Of Sadness
If You Live For That Day
On That You Will Hear Well Done
Chorus
We're On The Train Going To Heaven
We're On The Journey Of Faith
And When Our Life Here Is Over
We Will Answer To God
This Is A Train Of Glory
This Is A Journey Of Faith
Cause When Our Work Here Is Over
We Will Hear Well Done

(Chants)
Chorus
We're on the train going to heaven
We're on the journey of faith
And when our life here is over
We will answer to  God
This is a train of glory
This is a journey of faith
cause when our work here is over
we will hear well done
