Make Us One
Father Spirit Son
We Wanna We Wanna Be Just Like You
Your Glory Is Enough
Bind Us With Your Love
We Wanna We Wanna Be Just Like You


Yes, We Wanna We Wanna Be Just Like You

Come And Fill Our Hearts
Come And Fill Our Minds
Come And Fill Our Souls
Holy Spirit

With The Fire That Unites Us
With The Fire That Ignites Us
By Your Spirit Come And Make Us One
We Are Filled With Expectations
For A Holy Revelation

We Are Praying Father Make Us One
We Are Awakening To Truth
To The Things We Never Knew
Ooh Help Us Love Like You

With The Passion For Our Brothers
We Will Love One Another
By Your Spirit Come And Make Us One
Oh We Are Tired Of Tradition

That Is Void Of True Conviction
Ooh, Jesus Show Us How It's Done
We Are Awakening To Truth
To The Things We Never Knew
Ooh Help Us Love Like You

Come And Fill Our Hearts
Come And Fill Our Minds
Come And Fill Our Souls
Holy Spirit


Holy Spirit, Come
All, All We Want Is You God

Wash And Cleanse Us With Your Blood
So We See Through The Eyes Of Love
Revive Us

Holy Spirit
Holy Spirit Come
Come Like The Day Of Pentecost
Revive Us Again

Revive Us Again

Wash And Cleanse Us With Your Blood
So We See Through The Eyes Of Love
Revive Us

Wash And Cleanse Us With Your Blood
So We See Through The Eyes Of Love
Unite Us
