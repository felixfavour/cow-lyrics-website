Here in Your light we find
What makes us come alive
A sacrifice of praise
A city on a hill
Surrendered to Your will
Your glory on display
Your glory on display
Awesome in this place
Jesus, You are awesome in this place
Worthy to be praised
Jesus, You are worthy to be praised
You will be praised
You will be praised
Your love a force of grace
Consuming every space
It's uncontainable
You're coming like a flood
Our hearts are filling up
All things are possible
All things are possible
