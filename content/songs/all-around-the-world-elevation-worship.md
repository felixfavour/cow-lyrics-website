Your church sings in chorus
To tell how great and glorious...you are God
Our hearts respond to greatness, God
There is no other name that is higher
Chorus:
All around the world we sing your praises out
Your name is great, we celebrate
Jesus, your fame is what we're living for
A life of praise, we celebrate
Your people gather to proclaim
The rising anthem of your name...God
Our hearts respond to greatness, God
There is no other name that is higher
Bridge:
We listen and we move, our hearts respond to you
We listen and we move, our hearts respond to you
Chorus 2x
