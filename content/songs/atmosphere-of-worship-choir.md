Ore bi Jesu (A friend like Jesus)
Ko si l'aiye yi (You can't find in this world)
Jesu nikan l'ore otito (Jesus alone is the true friend)
Ore aiye yi le ko wa sile (Our earthly friends may forsake us)
Sugbon Jesu ko je gbagbe mi (But Jesus can never forget me)
Aah! Ko je gbagbe mi (Aah! can never forget)
(Ore otito o!) (The very true friend o!)
Aah! Ko je gbagbe mi (Aah! can never forget)
(Hallelujah!)
Sugbon Jesu koje gbagbe mi (But Jesus can never forget me)

There’s not a Friend like the lowly Jesus:
  No, not one! no, not one!
None else could heal all our souls’ diseases:
  No, not one! no, not one!

Jesus knows all about our struggles;
  He will guide ’til the day is done:
There’s not a Friend like the lowly Jesus:
    No, not one! no, not one!

The Great Physician now is near,
  The sympathizing Jesus;
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
  Oh, hear the voice of Jesus!

Sweetest note in seraph song;
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
Sweetest carol ever sung:
Jesus, blessed Jesus!
