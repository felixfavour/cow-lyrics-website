There is a love
That can't be imagined
It comes from the Father of Lights to my soul
It overcomes the darkness that I used to hide in
It covers me and makes me whole, oh-whoa
And I want to give You my world
To reveal all I am
And all I've become
And I wanna give You my world
To surrender my life
And all that is in me
To You
There is a peace
That can't be contained
It burrows its way to the depths of my soul
It changes my life, my entire being
It covers me, it makes me whole
And I want to give You my world
To reveal all I am
And all I've become
And I wanna give You my world
To surrender my life
And all that is in me
