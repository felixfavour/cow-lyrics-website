My will and Yours a tug of war
But I’ll stay yielded, I’ll stay yielded
I will not dare to call You Lord
If I don’t mean it, if I don’t mean it
Keep me tender and tethered to Your decrees
Let my love be a covenant that I keep
I will obey
I will obey
Not because I have to
But because I love You
Sweeter than honey on my lips
Is Your teaching, is Your teaching
Show me the way, I’ll walk in it
I will Jesus, I will Jesus
Be the light and the lamp that my feet follow
Keep the eyes of my heart on the narrow road
I will obеy
I will obey
Not because I havе to
But because I love You
