[Instrumental]
From Heaven, You can hear
I know You're drawing near
As I worship
Held within Your love
The wind and waves will come
But I will stay here
I lift my hands to Heaven
Here my heart surrendered
I tell my soul again
You are Lord of all
And though the seas are raging
You will speak and tame them
In You, I find my rest
You are in control
Through valleys, I will trust
Your spirit is enough, to keep me walking
You guide my every step
Speak life to me again
Lord, I need You
Oh I need You
