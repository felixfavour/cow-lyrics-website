ory of a blessed child
I've been through a lot but I'm here now
I can't really explain how I got here
But all well on me I can use all my time here
Story of a blessed child
I've been through a lot but I'm here now
I can't really explain how I got here
But all well on me I can use all my time here
Na You dey make me dey wonder
You're the greatest no other God
Like You o o ah my Jehovah eh eh
For when I wake in the morning
Till I'm done for the day
Na so so love I dey see o o
Nobody wey love me like You o o
Agbanilagbatan o na You wey dey make me dey rababa o
You show me Your love and You add jara o
I call on Your name and You answer me o o o
Agbanilagbatan o na You wey dey make me dey rababa o
You show me Your love and You add jara o
I call on Your name and You answer me o o o
Ele o ele o ele ele Eledumare
Ele o ele o ele ele Eledumare o
This can only be God this can only be God eh eh
This can only be God this can only be God eh eh
This can only be God this can only be God eh eh
This can only be God this can only be God eh eh
Line them up line them up
They say the thing must until we've been lifted up
But how is it we find that the worst of us
Are the ones that will drink from Your golden cup
Oh Lord I think the process is flawed
How is the weakest were the ones that were strong?
How come the meek have a seat by Your throne?
The ones that have flaws are the ones that You call
This is not what I've been taught no
I know the things of the Spirit of God
All things have value have never been bought
And joint with the freedom you took on the cross
Yahweh don't mind if I call You Daddy
Showing me how much You love me
I doubt I'd be here till You found me
Ele o ele o ele ele Eledumare
Ele o ele o ele ele Eledumare o
This can only be God this can only be God eh eh
This can only be God this can only be God eh eh
This can only be God this can only be God eh eh
This can only be God this can only be God eh eh
Because You love me jeje You love me tender
Na You dey do all the things wey dey make me wonder
You love me jeje You love me tender
That's why You dey do all the things wey dey make me wonder
