We were created by design
We were purposed for this time
A generation on the rise
We won't back down
We are alive and we're awake
Move in the power of His name
A generation unashamed
We won't back down
 (Ay)
[Chorus: Seth, 
Nirva
, 
Both
]
We won't back down
We will not be shaken
Church awaken now
We won't back down
We will not be silent
Live our lives out loud
We won't back down
[Post-Chorus: Seth, 
Nirva
]
Oh, wе won't back down
No, we won't back down, oh
We hear thе cries of those in need
The world is waiting now to see
A generation who loves Jesus
We won't back down
