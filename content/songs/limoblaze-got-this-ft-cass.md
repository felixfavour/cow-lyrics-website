I don de wait
One day and now again
Where u de?
Promises wey you make
I don call you taya
I don call u taya (still calling)
I don buzz your number
I don buzz your number (still buzzing)
So why you ignore me (ignore me X2)
Na you say make i call you (don call u X2)
Why you de ignore me (ignore me X2)
Omoh u made a promise (promise)
Shey u dey wine me (wine me)
Almost lost my mind
Thinking why you did it
Thinking why you did it
Cos i was on my own when you made a promise
You didn't have to do it
God's gat this
Now i know He gat this
All the times i was still hurting
Now i know He gat this (He's gat this)
He turned my pain into lessons
He taught me to not depend on
The promises men will make me
He gat this
He gat this
Make you no go come de put your trust in any man o
Cos na only God e fit to do the things you want
Oh this love
He can do anything for the one wey Him love
He will do anything for the one wey Him love
Love ooo
Love oooo ( love)
Omoh no go do like this again
So why you ignore me (ignore me X2)
Na you say make i call you (don call u X2)
Why you de ignore me (ignore me X2)
Omoh u made a promise (promise)
Shey u dey wine me (wine me)
God's gat this
Now i know He gat this
All the times i was still hurting
Now i know He gat this (He's gat this)
He turned my pain into lessons
He taught me to not depend on
The promises men will make me
He gat this
He gat this
Every time am with Him
I see myself so clearly
It's cos i know I'm better
Wetin dem want is near me
He's doing some new things
This i know
I am choosing to keep moving
God's gat this (oh ohooooooo)
No need to rewind it (oh ohooooooo)
Yeah
Everybody wants to know the next thing
Wanna stay holding on the best thing (yeah)
Cos I know God I'm a blessed king
No flexing
Correcting
God's gat this
Now i know He gat this
All the times i was still hurting
Now i know He gat this (He's gat this)
He turned my pain into lessons
He taught me to not depend on
The promises men will make me
He gat this
He gat this
