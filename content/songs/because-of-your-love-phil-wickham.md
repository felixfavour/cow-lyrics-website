Jesus, You endured my pain
Savior, You bore all my shame
All because of Your love
[Pre-Chorus]
Maker of the universe
Broken for the sins of the earth
All because of Your love
All because of Your love
Because of Your cross, my debt is paid
Because of Your blood, my sins are washed away
Now all of my life, I freely give
Because of Your love
Because of Your love, I live
Innocence and Holy King
You died to set the captives free
All because of Your love
[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, You gave Your life for me
So I will live my life for You
All because of Your love
All because of Your love
