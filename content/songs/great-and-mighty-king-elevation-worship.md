Instrumental Intro
]
Your love has rescued us
The cross delivered all our hearts from fear
Our hope is here
Your love has rescued us
You came to make a way
Jesus, You came to raise the dead to life
Our song will rise
Oh great and mighty King, You reign in majesty
Before Your throne we sing, "Holy, holy"Oh great and mighty King, for all eternity
We bow with heaven and sing, "Holy, holy Lord"What do we have to bring
This is our offering
Our hearts before the risen Lord
All power in Your Name
Jesus the One who saves, be lifted high
Our song will rise
Oh great and mighty King, You reign in majesty
Before Your throne we sing, "Holy, holy"Oh great and mighty King, for all eternity
We bow with heaven and sing, "Holy, holy Lord"
