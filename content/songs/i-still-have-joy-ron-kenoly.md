I've been tested
My faith has been tried
Satain has attempted to destroy my life
He's robbed abused accused and stole
He's done everything he could do
To conquer my soul
I still have joy
I still have joy
After all I've been through
I still have joy (2x)
Friends have left me
They've questioned my faith
The good I tried to do
Was thrown back in my face
The hurt and the pain brought tears to my eyes
But God has replaced a blessing
For every tear that I've cried
I still have joy
I still have joy
After all I've been through
I still have joy (2x)
I still have peace
I still have peace
After all I've been through
I still have peace (2x)
