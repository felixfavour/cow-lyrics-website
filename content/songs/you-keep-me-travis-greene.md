Yeah, I've sinned
Fell short of Your glory
Messed up, ain't proud of it but
Your love is more than enough
You keep on keeping me, yeah
And don't know why You never left me
I'm not sure but through it all, Lord, You kept me
And I'm here by Your grace and love
And You keep on keeping me
Ooo, You keep me
Ooo, never let go
Ooo, You keep me
Safe in Your arms
No danger or harm's in You
You keep on keeping me
You keep on keeping me
You keep on keeping me
Ooo, You keep on keeping me
You keep on keeping me
You keep on keeping me
Ooo, You keep me
Ooo, never let go
Ooo, You keep me
Safe in Your arms
No danger or harm's in You
