Jesus, I am willing even if it's not the way I planned
I want what You want
I lay down my opinions and offer every part of me again
I want what You want
I just want what You want
I don't need all the answers
I've never been more sure You're in control
You're in it all, Lord of it all
And I will stay surrendered
Even when it feels uncomfortable
You're in it all, Lord of it all
Jesus, I am ready, I will not refuse the narrow road
I'll go where You go
I give You my desires 'cause I don't want another if You don't
'Cause my life is not my own
I don't need all the answers
I've nеver been more sure You'rе in control
You're in it all, Lord of it all
And I will stay surrendered
Even when it feels uncomfortable
You're in it all, Lord of it all
You're in it all, Lord of it all
