Enter in
Through the gates
Enter in
Here with praise
Come before Him, come bring your song
We are His people, He is our God
For the Lord is good, and His love endures
His love endures
For the Lord is good, and His love endures
His love endures
Forevermore His faithfulness, it has no end
For the Lord is good, and His love endures
His love endures
Enter in
To His courts
Enter in
With grateful hearts
Come before Him
Come bring your song
We are His people, He is our God
For the Lord is good, and His love endures
His love endures
For the Lord is good, and His love endures
His love endures
Forevermore His faithfulness, it has no end
