yeah
yh
oh oh oh
when you walked across the room
And asked me to dance with you
you said you are the one I chose
I couldn't believe it
and you were just passing by
when you looked me in my eyes
and I found my paradise
oh oh
you are my paradise
I'm not leaving
Chorus
even if the sun drops out of the sky
even if the stars stop shinning at night
even if the drummer stops keeping the time
if your hands are in mine
I won't stop dancing
dancing mountain of the victory
dancing through the valley of a broken dream
dancing on the plains of the in between
if it's you and me
I won't stop dancing
hmmmmmmm
I won't stop dancing
Tiffany:
we've made some memories
yh, we've got some history
if we told them everything
they'd never believe it
so many loves out there
but none of them can compare
to this secret space we share
oh oh oh
I'm dancing away my cares
I'm not leaving
chorus; JOEL $ TIFFANY
even if the sun drops out of the sky
even if the stars stop shinning at night
even if the drummers stop keeping the time .
if your hands are in mine
I won't stop dancing
dancing on the mountain of the victory
dancing through the valley of a broken dream
dancing on the plains of the in between
if it's you and me
I won't stop dancing
oh oh oh oh
