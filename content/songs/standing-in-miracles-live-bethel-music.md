I see You in the skies with purple hues
I hear You in the quiet morning too
And when the world is still asleep
I’m waking up to You
I see You in the glow of summer nights
I feel You in the dance of ocean tides
And when the world is unaware
I am aware of You
I don’t have to search hard to find You
I don’t have to reach far to touch You
Standing in miracles wherever I go
I don’t have to struggle to hear You
Your presence is easy to get to
Standing in miracles wherever I go
I’m walking on the hills of holy ground
You take me on thе path with scenic routes
Your voice is upon thе wind
And I am listening
