There is a name, I like to call
It stand alone, and conquers all
And every chain, and every wall
Will be released, and have to fall
Jesus

(There is a name...)
There is a name, I like to call
It stands alone, and conquers all
We call your name, for every wall
And Jericho, will have to fall
Jesus

There's no name like your name

The soon and coming King
Hallelujah (Yeahhh)
