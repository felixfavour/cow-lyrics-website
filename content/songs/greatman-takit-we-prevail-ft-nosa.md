    You said to ask you for the nation So with one voice we raise a cry       The lamentations of the people have gone to God So we declare
       That Like a bird that's out of a cage we have escaped we have escaped And like a warrior victorious in battle
We have prevailed we have prevailed Like a bird that's out of a cage we have escaped we have escaped And like a warrior victorious in battle We have prevailed we have prevailed The blood of the Lamb speaks Lamb speaks Lamb speaks we have prevailed The mercy of the Lord speaks Lord speaks Lord speaks we have prevailed

 What is our identification We are those marked by the blood What is our current situation We are raising a standard against the flood And if you ask me our location We are hidden in Christ in God We are covered by His grace A strong tower is his name
And like a bird we have escaped
Like a bird that's out of a cage we have escaped we have escaped And like a warrior victorious in battle We have prevailed we have prevailed Like a bird that's out of a cage we have escaped we have escaped And like a warrior victorious in battle We have prevailed we have prevailed
The blood of the Lamb speaks Lamb speaks Lamb speaks we have prevailed The mercy of the Lord speaks Lord speaks Lord speaks we have prevailed
The angels of the Lord fight for us
The army of the Lord fights Lord fights Lord fights we have prevailed The sword of the Lord strikes
