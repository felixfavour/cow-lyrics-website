Woah
It hurts me to see you give up
'Cause the battle is not flesh and blood
It's all a delusion to live in confusion
So you gotta set your mind on things above
Don't forget who's the real enemy
And they hate you've been granted victory
But still life feels wrong, you can't fix it on your own
You'll never be free if you live by what you see

So over and over and over again
Remind yourself when your flesh wants to win (Jesus)
It's not about me
This is not my home
And everything's spiritual
Yes, it's all spiritual
Help me to see
That I don't belong here
'Cause I am spiritual
You make me spiritual
Me
(Let's go)
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh I
Oh, oh I
I, oh I (Haha)
I'm spiritual
Oh, oh I
Oh, oh I
I, oh I
(Listen)
We celebrate fortune and fame (But tell me)
But tell me, does heaven know your name? (How much did it cost you?)
How much was the price for you to live your best life?
Tell me, did you lose much more than you gained?

(So over)
So over and over and over again (Speak to yourself)
Remind yourself when your flesh wants to win (It's not about me)
It's not about me (Father)
This is not my home
And everything's spiritual
Yes, it's all spiritual (Yes, God)
Help me to see
That I don't belong here (Yes)
'Cause I am spiritual (I'm spiritual)
You make me spiritual
Me
(Woo!)
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh I
Oh, oh I
I, oh I (Spiritual)
I'm spiritual (I'm just visitin')
Oh, oh I (Haha)
Oh, oh I
I, oh I
(Listen)
We were made to live forever
(God is knocking on your heart)
Say if you wanna live together (Forever)
Forever
[Bridge]
It's not about me
This is not my home
Everything's spiritual
Everything's spiritual
It's not about me (It's not about me)
This is not my home (This is not my home now)
Everything's spiritual (It's spiritual)
Everything's spiritual (It's spiritual)
It's not about me (It's not about me)
This is not my home (This is not my home now)
Everything's spiritual (It's spiritual)
Everything's spiritual (It's spiritual)
It's not about me (It's not about me)
This is not my home (This is not my home)
Everything's spiritual (Everything's spiritual)
Everything's spiritual
It's not about me (It's not about me)
This is not my home (This is not my home now)
Everything's spiritual (It's spiritual)
Everything's spiritual (It's spiritual)
It's not about me (Not about me)
This is not my home (This is not my home now)
Everything's spiritual (It's spiritual)
Everything's spiritual (It's spiritual)
[Outro]
Oh, oh I
Oh-oh-oh, I, I, oh I
Oh, oh I
Oh-oh-oh, I, oh I
Oh, oh I
Oh-oh-oh, I, I, oh I
