You called out my name
Knew my past, covered my shame
This amazing grace
You've shown, so patiently
You’ve shown, so patiently
And You, waited for me
Just for me
For me
You, waited for me
Just for me
For me
Where would I be? If You left me God
Where would I be? If You left me God
Where would I be? If You left me God
Where would I be? If You left me God
You waited, waited
You waited, waited
You waited, waited
You waited, waited
Where would I be? If You left me God
Where would I be? If You left me God
Where would I be? If You left me God
Where would I be? If You left
You waited, waited
You waited, waited
You waited, waited
You waited, waited
You waited, waited
You waited, waited
(Where would I be?) Where would I be? If You left me God
(Where would I be?) Where would I be? If You left me God
(Where would I be?) Where would I be?
