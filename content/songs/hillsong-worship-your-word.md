before the earth you knew it's foundations
you spoke the dust into creation
and turned the earth when all is withered
and still your word angels forever
a weapon to my feet
and light unto my path
ooo ooo ooooooo your word will not be shaken
your word will never fail me
like a fire in my bones
like a whisper to my soul
your word is revelation.....
    deep cause today within your presence
when I feel your spirit my soul awakens
your spirit makes my heart to worship
because your word reveals the light of Jesus
a weapon to my feet and light unto my path ooo ooo ooooooo your word will not be shaken, your word will never fail me
like a fire in my bones
like a whisper to my soul
your word is revelation.oh ooo
..
ohhh oooo ooooo Jesus eeeee eeeee eeeee
your word will not be shaken, your word will never fail me
like a fire in my bones
like a whisper to my soul
your word is revelation 2x
     your word will never fail me
    like a fire in my bones
     like a whisper to my soul
     your word is revelation....
