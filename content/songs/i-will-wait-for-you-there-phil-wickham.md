I will wait for You there
Down on my knees where I met You
Give You all of my cares
Find a grace to hold onto now
I'm calling for You
I will wait for You there
Far from the world and it's violence
It left me broken and bare
I need to hear You in the silence now
I'm calling for You
And with outstretched arms I will sing out melodies
And my beating heart will pour out a symphony
Hallelujah's in the morning, hallelujah's in the night
I will wait for You as long as I have life
I will wait for You there
Down on my knees where I met You
'Cause life is a war fought with tears
But You are the strength I hold onto now
I'm calling for You
