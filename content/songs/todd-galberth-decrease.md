Lord I decrease so you can increase
Have Your way through me
Don't let my will get in the way
Don't let my flesh drive you away
Lord I decrease
Have Your way through me
Lord I decrease so You can increase
Have Your way through me
Don't let my will get in the way
Don't let my flesh drive You away
Don't let my will get in the way
Don't let my flesh drive You away
Don't let my will get in the way
Don't let my flesh drive you away
Don't let my will get in the way
Don't let my flesh drive You away
Don't let my will get in the way
Don't let my flesh drive You away
Lord I decrease
Have Your way through me
(come on can somebody just thank him)
Don't let my will get in the way
Any body messed so many time and
I'm tired of getting m'A own way
lift your voice and say
Don't let my will get in the way
I want you to pray this when yau wake up in the morning
just lift up your voice to the Lord and say God please
Don't let my will get in the way
I'm tired of blowing I'm tired of going into circles
I'm tired of seeing the same things over and over please
Don't let my will get in the way
