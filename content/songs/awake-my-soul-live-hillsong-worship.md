There is a sound I love to hear
It's the sound of the Saviour's robe
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear praises, He hears faith
There is a sound I love to hear
It's the sound of the Saviour's robe
As He walks into the room where people pray
Where we hear worship, He hears faith
[Pre-Chorus]
Okay, let Him hear your praise, let Him hear your worship tonight
Oh, yes, ooh
Awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
Oh, awake my soul and sing
Sing His praise aloud
Sing His praise aloud
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh
Oh, woah, alright
