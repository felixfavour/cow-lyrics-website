I heard Your echo in the canyon
Upon the timberline
You said these mountains were Your invention
And so was this heart of mine
I heard You whisper on the water
There on the mighty sea
You spoke of love deep as the ocean
When You spoke of Your love for me
I am loved by the Father
I am loved by the Son
It is love that has captured
The heart of this wayward one
I heard Your laughter in the sunrise
Amidst the morning birds
A song of freedom for all creation
And You sang me every word
I heard You singing in the silence
A simple melody
Words of love, O I can hear it
My Father is very fond of me
