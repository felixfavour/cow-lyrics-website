At the altar
You can tell
Jesus
All about it
At the altar
You can tell
What you heart has to say
You can tell Him
How you need Him
How you thank Him
And how you love Him
At the altar
When you kneel
To pray
So if your journey through life has been bittersweet
And the courage to dream has turned incomplete
At the altar your brokenness He will meet
There's joy in knowing He's near
So if your journey through life has been bittersweet
And the courage to dream has turned incomplete
At the altar your brokenness He will meet
There's joy in knowing He's near
