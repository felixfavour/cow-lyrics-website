Look
God i need answers
Life’s been tough
And my hearts been shattered
I’ve been stabbed in the back
With a dagger and i feel like i don’t matter
I gave so many pages of my life now
I lost a few chapters and
Honestly, my minds a disaster
Hiding all this pain with the laughter
And i say i’m okay
When really i ain’t
I hold in all the pain
Hoping it’ll all go away
But it won’t
And it never will
They tell me that they love me
But i question if its real
Damn this worlds so cold
So you bound to get killed
They only around when they need me
They don’t care bout how i feel
I’m so tired of thе all the lies
I’m tired of fakе friends
All this pain deep inside like
When the hell will it end
I know i say i’m alright
But thats all just pretend
And i tend to lose my mind
Guess it’s happening again
God damn
