When He moves among us all that He does
All of His mercy, all of His love
If the pen of a writer could write everyday
Even this world could never contain
How I've been blessed

Warmth in the winter, flowers in spring
Laughter at summer, the changing of leaves
Food on my table and a good place to sleep
Clothes on my back and shoes on my feet
I have been blessed

I have been blessed, God's so good to me
Precious are His thoughts of you and me
No way I could count them, there's not enough time
So I'll just thank Him for being so kind
God has been good, so good
I have been blessed

Arms that will raise, a voice that can talk
Hands that can touch, legs that can walk
Ears that can listen, eyes that can see
I've got to praise Him as long as I breathe
I have been blessed

A mother and father who nurtured and raised
Sisters and brother, memories made
Our pastor to lead us this altar to pray
Stripes that can heal the blood that still saves
I have been blessed

I have been blessed, God's so good to me
Precious are His thoughts of you and me
No way I could count them, there's not enough time
So I'll just thank Him for being so kind
God has been good, so good
I have been blessed.

We live in a country the greatest on earth
Where the flag stands for freedom and what it is worth
She stands in the harbor, Miss Liberty calls
All have given some but some gave it all
So we could be blessed

He's my shoulder to lean on when I am down
The rock where He leads me when I'm overwhelmed
The place where He hides me under His wings
He's not just a song, He's the reason I sing
I have been blessed

I have been blessed, God's so good to me
Precious are His thoughts of you and me
No way I could count them, there's not enough time
So I'll just thank Him for being so kind
God has been good, so good
I have been blessed

God has been good, so good
I have been blessed
