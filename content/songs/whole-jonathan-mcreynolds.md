What can make me whole again?
What is the meaning of a bird if it has no wings?
What is the meaning of a life if it has no dreams?
Where is the power of a tree if it has no roots?
What is the meaning of my life if there is no you?
You make me whole
You make me whole
You make me whole
You make me whole
What is the beauty in a star if it doesnt shine?
What is the value of a clock if it cant keep time?
I couldnt appreciate the light without the dark
Until you came in I was only using half my heart
But you made me whole
You make me whole
You make me whole
You make me whole
All the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldnt put my life together again
But when the king himself came in
He did, He did
Father, you did.
You made me whole
You made me whole
You take the broken and you make them whole
You made me whole
I was divided, defeated, flying blind 'till you gave me
Direction, wisdom and strengthened my convictions
I thank you
I thank you
'Cause your loving made me whole
