You promised to renew our strength
You promised to be our revival
So Father, we'll wait on You
I will run
And not grow weary
I will walk
I will not fade
I will soar
On wings like eagles
Find my rest in Your everlasting name
You are my revival
God on You, I wait
And I'll lean on Your promise
You will renew my strength
We will run
(And not grow weary)
Never grow weary
(We will walk)
We will walk
(We will not fade)
We will not fade
(We will soar)
We will soar
(On wings like eagles)
Like eagles
(Find our rest in Your everlasting name)
In Your everlasting name
You are our revival
God on You, we wait
Leaning on Your promise
You will renew our strength
You are our revival
Yeah, yes You are
(God on You, we wait)
We wait
Leaning on Your promise
You will renew our strength
We wait patiently on You
(Leaning on Your promise)
On Your promise
(You will renew our strength)
You will, You will renew our strength
So we pray Lord You
Yes we do
(You will renew our strength)
You will renew
Our strength
You will renew our strength
(You will renew our strength)
We will run
And not grow weary
We will walk
We will not fade
We will soar
On wings like eagles
Find our rest in Your everlasting name
You are our revival
God on You, we wait
