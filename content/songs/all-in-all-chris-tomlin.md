Worthy that is what You are
Worthy King over my heart
There is none like You
There's no one else
[Pre-Chorus]
Mercy that is what I need
Mercy with every breath I breathe
Where would I be now all by myself
You are the water for my soul
You are the hands that won't let go
You are the calm within my storm
You are the love that will endure
You are the victor in the fight
Over the darkness You'rе the light
You are the hopе I'm hanging on
You are my everlasting song
You are my all in all
You are my all in all
Holy, heaven and earth cry
Holy, Lord over my life
Where would I be now without Your love
Where would I be now without Your love
