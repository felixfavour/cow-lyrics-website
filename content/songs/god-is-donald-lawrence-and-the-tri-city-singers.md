God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever
My heart was wounded
I was pricked in my reins
Nevertheless, I'm forever with Thee
Whom else in heaven, none on the earth
My heart's desire is to be with Thee
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever
My heart was wounded
I was pricked in my reins
Nevertheless, I'm forever with Thee
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever
