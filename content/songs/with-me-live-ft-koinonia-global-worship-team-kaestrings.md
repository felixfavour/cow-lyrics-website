When I
Don't understand
All that surrounding me
I'm rest assured
Coz I'm not here alone
I'm not moved coz there's one thing i know
Ow ow
Chorus:
Through it all
-Ba za ka bar ni ba
(You will never leave me)
Through it all
-Ba za ka bar ni ba
(You will never leave me)
Through the fire, Through the storm
-Ba za ka bar ni ba ahâ¦ Ahâ¦
(You will never leave me)
Ka na tarÃ© da ni
(You're With Me)
ohh oh I believe I believe yeh and I rejoice cause (Ka na tare da ni) yeh yeh
Verse 2:
When I
Can't comprehend
All the happenings
Within my world
I'm not afraid
Coz there's one thing I know
I'm not moved
Coz i know you are with me
Chorus:
Through it all......
-Ba za ka bar ni ba

The fire burns
And I'm not hurt

And I'm at peace
Through the raging Storm
