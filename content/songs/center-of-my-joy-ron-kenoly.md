Jesus You're the center of my joy
All that's good and perfect
Comes from You
You're the heart of my contentment
Hope for all I do
Jesus You're the center of my joy
Jesus You're the center of my joy
All that's good and perfect
Comes from You
You're the heart of my contentment
Hope for all I do
Jesus You're the center of my joy
When I've lost my direction
You're the compass for my way
You're the fire and light when
Nights are long and cold
Through the sadness You are the laughter
That shadows all my fears
When I'm down and out
Your hand is there to hold
Jesus You're the center of my joy
All that's good and perfect
Comes from You
You're the heart of my contentment
Hope for all I do
Jesus You're the center of my joy
