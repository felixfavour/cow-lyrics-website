When you've prayed every prayer that you know how to pray,
Just remember the Lord will hear and the answer is on it's way,
Our God is able!
He is mighty!
He is faithful!
And He never sleeps, He never slumbers,
He never tires of hearing our prayer,
When we are weak, He becomes stronger,
So rest in His love and cast all of your cares on Him,
Do you feel that the Lord has forgotten your need,
Just remember that God is always working in ways you cannot see,
Our God is able!
He is mighty!
He is faithful!
And He never sleeps, He never slumbers,
He never tires of hearing our prayer,
When we are weak, He becomes stronger,
So rest in His love and cast all of your cares on Him,
He never sleeps, He never slumbers,
He never tires of hearing our prayer,
When we are weak, He becomes stronger,
So rest in His love and cast all of your cares on Him...
He never sleeps, He never slumbers,
He never tires of hearing our prayer,
When we are weak, He becomes stronger,
So rest in His love and cast all of your cares on Him,
He never sleeps, He never slumbers,
He never tires of hearing our prayer,
When we are weak, He becomes stronger,
So rest in His love and cast all of your cares,
So rest in His love and cast all of your cares,
So rest in His love and cast all of your cares on Him
