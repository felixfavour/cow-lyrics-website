And I saw the heavens open
And an Eagle came out of the heavens
And landed on the heart of Africa
And as the wind from the eagle's wings blew on the earth
It blew away the draught and the famine and the hunger and the sickness and the thirst
And as the Eagle landed on the heart
It wings flap some more and the wind of the Spirit blew in the land and then it took off
And in it's place rose the lion
So the lion rises
Africa rises!
Africa rises!!
Africa rises!!!
And this is what God says,
You were taught by your ancestors to love your neighbor and hate the ones that hate you
But however I say to you
Love your enemies bless the one who curses you
Do something wonderful for the one who hates you
And respond to the ones who persecute you by praying for them
For this will reveal your identity as children of your father
He is kind to all by bringing the sunrise to warm and bring forth refresh
Whether a person does what is good or evil
For what reward do you deserve if you only love the loveable
How are you any different from others if you limit your kindness only to your friends
Even the ungodly do that
And because you are my children  you are to be like me
So Africa, your weapon is LOVE.
