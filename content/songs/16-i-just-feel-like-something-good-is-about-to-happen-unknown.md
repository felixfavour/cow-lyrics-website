I just feel like something good is about to happen. I just feel like something good is on its way. He has promised that He'd open all of heaven. And brother, it could happen any day.

When God's people humble themselves and call on Jesus. And they look to heaven expecting as they pray. I just feel like something good is about to happen. And brother, this could be that very day. 

I have learned in all that happens just to praise Him. For I knew He's working all things for my good. Every tear I shed is worth all the investment. For I know He'll see me through, He said He would.

He has promised eye nor ear can hardly fathom. All the things He has in store for those who pray. I just feel like something good is about to happen. And brother, this could be that very day.

Yes, I've noticed all the bad news in the paper. And it seems like things get bleaker everyday. But for this child of God it makes no difference. Because, it's bound to get better either way.

Well, I've never been more thrilled about tomorrow. Sunshine's always bursting through the skies of gray. I just feel like something good is about to happen. And brother, this could be that very day. 

I just feel like something good is about to happen. I just feel like something good is on its way. He has promised that He'd open all of heaven. And brother, it could happen any day.

When God's people humble themselves and call on Jesus. And they look to heaven expecting as they pray. I just feel like something good is about to happen. And brother, this could be that very day.
