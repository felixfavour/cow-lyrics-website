I'm changed I'm not the same
The Father called me by my name
He called me through His Son
The Father's holy righteous One
We are the first fruits
The children of the King
Chorus:
Praise to the Father of lights
In Him there's day there is no night
Every good gift comes from above
A certain sign of the Father's love (repeat)
He made me in His image And I'm wonderfully made
He saved me through His only Son And I'm wonderfully saved
