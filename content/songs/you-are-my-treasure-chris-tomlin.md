[Chorus]
I'm created for you alone
Bought with a price i'm not my own
I'm seated in the heavenlies
And there's no place i'd rather be
Than with you forever lord [x2]
Than with you forever lord
Than with you forever lord
You are my treasure
Faithful lord, fill my cup
With your grace and love, your grace and love
The pleasures that this world's sure of
Will never be enough, can never be enough
Cause i'm created for you alone
Bought with a price i'm not my own
I'm seated in the heavenlies
And there's no place i'd rather be
Than with you forever lord
You are my treasure
