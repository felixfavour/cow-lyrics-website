I just gotta believe
There is goodness around the corner
And something better is in store for me (Ah-ah)
Someday I will see
There's a reason for all these tears
And there's an answer to these prayers
I just gotta believe
That it's gonna work out like I knew it would, ooh
I'll finish stronger than I thought I could
There's a rainbow behind the clouds
The sun is bursting out
This can't be the end (This can't be the end)
I know that there is so much more
And I will find an open door
If I only believe, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
That this is just one page in my story
And if I keep breathing
And if I keep believing
It's gonna work out like I knew it would
I'll finish stronger than I thought I could
There's a rainbow behind the clouds
The sun is bursting out, oh I
It's gonna work out like I knew it would, yeah
I'll finish stronger than I thought I could
There's a rainbow behind the clouds (Ayy)
The sun is bursting out
