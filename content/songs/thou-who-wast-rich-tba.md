1 THOU Who wast rich beyond all splendour,
All for love’s sake becamest poor;
Thrones for a manger didst surrender,
Sapphire-paved courts for stable floor.
Thou Who wast rich beyond all splendour,
All for love’s sake becamest poor.

2 Thou Who art God beyond all praising,
All for love’s sake becamest man;
Stooping so low, but sinners raising
Heav’nwards by Thine eternal plan.
Thou Who art God beyond all praising,
All for love’s sake becamest man.

3 Thou Who art love beyond all telling,
Saviour and King, we worship Thee.
Emmanuel, within us dwelling,
Make us what Thou wouldst have us be.
Thou Who art love, beyond all telling,
Saviour and King, we worship Thee.
