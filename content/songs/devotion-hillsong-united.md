I've been running trying to be one who sees
I've been working this salvation out on my knees
There is nothing better than knowing
We are redeemed
I'm believing trusting in creative hands
I am praying for our world to bow to Your plan
And this one thought is unmistakable
To take up my cross and follow You Lord
When You stand the tall trees and mountains bow
When You speak the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen and I fall to my knees
I'm forgiven by a Savior who did not deserve death
He was blameless I was lost in shamefulness
I'm delivered but it doesn't seem right
Unless I keep my eyes focused on the Savior
Who gave His life
In the middle of a world that denies it believes
It is breaking apart at the very seams
There is one thing to be alive for
To take up this cross and follow You Lord
