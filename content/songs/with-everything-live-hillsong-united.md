Open our hearts
To see the things
That make Your heart cry
To be the church
The You would desire
Light to be seen
Break down our pride
And all the walls
We've built up inside
Our earthly crowns
And all our desires
We lay at Your feet
So let hope rise
And darkness tremble
In Your holy light
And every eye will see
Jesus, our God
Great and mighty to be praised
God of all days
Glorious in all of Your ways
Your majesty, the wonder and grace
In the light of Your name
