Thirsty for more you
More of your Spirit and truth
Wash me from all my sin
Fill me with your Spirit again
You're the river of love
Flowing with the grace and mercy
Flooding my soul
Filling my heart with peace
O river of love
Like streams in the desert
Giver of life
Giving your life and love
To set me free
Heal me and I'll be healed
Save me and I will be saved
You've filled me with songs of praise
Forever I will sing of your grace
You're the river of love
Flowing with the grace and mercy
Flooding my soul
Filling my heart with peace
O river of love
Like streams in the desert
Giver of life
Giving your life and love
To set me free
