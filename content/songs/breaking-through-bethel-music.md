Your love is like a sunrise
Shattering the dark of night
Your presence is a paradise, to our hearts
You’re filling all the world with light
You’re making every wrong thing right
You’re waking up the dead to life, in Your love
God You’re always breaking through the dark
Breaking into lives and healing hearts
Your love has torn the veil
Your love can never fail
Your love is making all things new
Your love is an eternal fire
A jealous and a pure desire
Strong enough to be the sacrifice, that set us free
You have taken all our sins away
You have risen and You’ve won the day
God You have broken every bond and chain, in Your love
God You’re always breaking through the dark
Breaking into lives and healing hearts
Your love has torn the veil
Your love can never fail
Your love is making all things new
