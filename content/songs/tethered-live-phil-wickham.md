And I don't wanna miss the beauty
Of Heaven all around me
Your power and Your mercy
The greatness of Your love
And I don't wanna lose the wonder
Of being in Your presence
Of knowing such a friendship
To be with You, my God
[Pre-Chorus]
Everything I am
I throw into Your hands
I just want my life to ever be entwined with You
Tethered to Your heart
And I just want my soul to ever stand in awe of You
Tethered to Your heart
Ooh, tethered to Your heart
What more could I desire?
What greater thing to treasure?
I'm convinced there's nothing better
Than living in Your love
Caught up in the wonder
Of being in Your presence
Of knowing such a friendship
To be with You, my God
