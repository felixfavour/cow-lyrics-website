We speak to nations
Hear the sound
The sound of the nations worshiping
Hear the sound
Of sons and daughters singing
Who will go for us?
Who will shout to the corners of the earth?
That Christ is King
We speak to nations, be open
We speak to nations, fall on your knees
We speak to nations
The Kingdom is coming near to you
We speak to strongholds, be broken
Powers of darkness, you have to flee
We speak to nations
The Kingdom is coming near to you
We speak to you, be free
(Yeah yeah)
Be free
Hear the sound, hear the sound
The sound of the nations calling
Hear the sound, hear the sound
