Before there was life
You were seated on high
From there You spoke time
And we were already on Your mind
Can't explain Your love
Without performance
You called us Your own
Couldn't afford it
So with Your blood, You bought our freedom
Can't explain Your love
Yeah
Ruler of everything
Worthy of all that we could bring
You are Great Jehovah
All power is Yours, ayy
Without performance
You called us Your own
Couldn't afford it
With Your blood You bought our freedom
Can't explain Your love
