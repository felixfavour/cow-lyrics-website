...
We see what you can do, oh God of wonders
Your power has no end
The things You've done before in greater measure
You will do again
Cause there's no prison wall You can't break through, no
Mountain You can't move, all things are possible
There's no broken body you can't raise, no
Soul that You can't save, all things are possible
The darkest night, You can light it up
You can light it up, oh God of revival
Let hope arise, death is overcome
You've already won, oh God of revival
You rose in victory and now You're seated
Forever on the throne
So why should my heart fear what You've defeated
I will trust in You alone
Cause there's no prison wall You can't break through no
Mountain You can't move, all things are possible
There's no broken body you can't raise, no
Soul that You can't save, all things are possible
The darkest night, You can light it up
You can light it up, oh God of revival
Let hope arise, death is overcome
You've already won, oh God of revival
God of revival
Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
Oh God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, hear the chains hit the ground
Oh God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
Oh God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, hear the chains hit the ground
Oh God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
Oh God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
Every stronghold will crumble, hear the chains hit the ground
Oh God of revival, pour it out, pour it out
