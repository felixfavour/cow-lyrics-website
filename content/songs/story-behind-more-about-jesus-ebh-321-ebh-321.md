"More About Jesus - EBH 321"

Eliza Edmunds Hewitt was born in Philadelphia 28 June 1851 - 1920.

She was educated in the public schools and after graduation from high school, she became a teacher.

However, she developed a spinal malady which cut short her career and made her a shut-in for many years.

During her recovery, she studied English literature.

She felt a need to be useful to her church and began writing poems for the children department.

She went on to teach Sunday school, take an active part in the Philadelphia Elementary Union and become Superintendent of the children department of Calvin Presbyterian Church.
