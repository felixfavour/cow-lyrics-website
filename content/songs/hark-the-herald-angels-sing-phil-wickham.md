Hark! The herald angels sing
"'Glory to the new-born King!'
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled"Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With Angelic Hosts proclaim
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the new-born King!"[Hook]
Glory to the King!
Christ, by highest Heav'n ador'd
Christ, the everlasting Lord
Late in time, behold Him come
Offspring of a Virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh, the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with man to dwell
Jesus, our Emmanuel
Hark! The herald angels sing
"Glory to the new-born King!"
