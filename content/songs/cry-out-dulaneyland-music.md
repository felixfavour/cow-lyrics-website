[Chorus]
Said that I will cry out to the Lamb
Said that I will cry out to the Lamb
Oh, oh, oh
I will cry out to the Lamb
Mm, I will cry out to the Lamb
[Refrain]
And everyone will bow at Your feet
And the world will see Your glory
Every tongue will confess that You're king
And the world will shout Your victory
Said that I will cry out to the Lamb
Early in the morning time
I will
 (Yeah) 
cry out to the Lamb
 (Ooh)
In the noon day, I will remember, God, I will
I will
 (Yeah) cry out to the Lamb (Yeah)
Said I
I will
 (Cry out to the) 
cry out to the Lamb
 (Cry out to the, yes)
Oh, oh
[Refrain]
And everyone bow at Your feet
And the world must see Your glory
And every tongue will confess that You're king
And the world shout Your victory
Mm-mm, mm
