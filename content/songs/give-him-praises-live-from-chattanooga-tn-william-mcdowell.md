You are the Lord God Almighty
You're perfect in everything You do
The angels declare You are holy
And no one else compares to You
We stand in awe of Your Glory
There is no other God like You
And here in Your presence we offer You
What we were created to do
Let creation
Every nation
Generations
Give Him praises
Let thе people
All His children
Lift your voicеs
Give Him Praises
(Say You are the Lord God Almighty)
You are the Lord God Almighty
You’re perfect in everything You Do
The angles declare You are holy
And no one else compares to You
We stand in awe of Your Glory
There is no other God like You
And here in Your presence we offer You
What we were created to do
