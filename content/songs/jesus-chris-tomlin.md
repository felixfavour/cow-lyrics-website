There is a truth, older than the ages
There is a promise, of things yet to come
There is One, born for our salvation
Jesus
There is a light, that overwhelms the darkness
There is a kingdom, that forever reigns
There is freedom, from the chains that bind us
Jesus, Jesus
Who walks on the waters
Who speaks to the sea
Who stands in the fire beside me
He roars like a lion
He bled as the lamb
He carries my healing in His hands
Jesus
There is a name, I call in times of trouble
There is a song, that comforts in the night
There is a voice, that calms the storm that rages
He is Jesus, Jesus
