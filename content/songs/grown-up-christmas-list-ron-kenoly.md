Do you remember me
I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
Everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath our tree
Well, Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a hurting human soul
