I whisper words about You endlessly
Mostly to myself 'cause You make me believe
No one could ever love me like You could
There wouldn't be a day I'd be alone
And never would there be a time I didn't know
'Cause no one could ever love me like You could
You have been the one who fulfills my dreams
I'll never let You go
If you stay with me
I promise, You would know
(No one)
Of all the times, I've reached out for You
(No one)
Oh, can't You see how I adore You
I couldn't spend my life without You
Please believe me, I would never doubt You
You've been the one to answer all my prayers
Anytime I need You, I know that You'll be there
'Cause no one could ever love me like You could
I'm hoping that you'll hear these prayers of mine
I'm hoping that we'll be together for all times
'Cause no one could ever love me like You could
You have been the one who fulfills my dreams
I'll never let You go
If You stay with me
I promise, You would know
(No one)
Of all the times, I've reached out for You
(No one)
Oh, can't You see how I adore You
I couldn't spend my life without You
Please believe me, I will never doubt You
Oh, I would do anything for You
To share that place in my heart
Please let me be the one
It would mean everything
There'll be no one to keep us apart
(No one)
Of all the times, I've reached out for You
(No one)
Oh, can't You see how I adore You
I couldn't spend my life without You
Please believe me, I will never doubt You
(No one)
Of all the times, I've reached out for You
(No one)
Oh, can't You see how I adore You
I couldn't spend my life without You
There is no one who could love me like You do
(No one)
Of all the times, I've reached out for You
(No one)
Oh, can't You see how I adore You
I couldn't spend my life without You
There is no one who could love me like You do
(No one)
Of all the times, I've reached out for You
(No one)
Oh, can't You see how I adore You
I couldn't spend my life without You
There is no one who could love me like You do
