There's beauty in my brokenness
I've got true love instead of pain
There's freedom though you've captured me
I've got joy instead of mourning
[Hook]
You give me joy
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
You give me joy
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
There's beauty in my brokenness
I've got true love instead of pain
There's freedom though you've captured me
I've got joy instead of mourning
You give me joy
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
You give me joy
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
