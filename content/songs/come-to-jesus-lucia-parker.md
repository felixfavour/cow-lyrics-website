V1
Take   one   step   and   he’ll   take   two
If   you   run   to   him,   He   will   run   to   you
Doesn’t   matter   what   you’re   going   through
Just   come   to   Jesus,   come   to   Jesus
Lay   your   troubles   down   right   here
Just   let   go   of   every   fear
And   the   condemnation   will   disappear
When   you   come   to   Jesus,   come   to   Jesus
CH
Come   to   Jesus
Come   find   Freedom
Come   to   Jesus
Just   as   you   are,   just   as   you   are
V2
Freedom   waits   for   all   oppressed
Weary   hearts   can   find   their   rest
Hear   the   father   calling   just   say   yes
Come   to   Jesus,   come   to   Jesus
Bridge
Just   as   I   am   Lord,   just   as   I   am
I   run   to   you   just   as   I   am
No   turning   back   no,   No   turning   back
I   run   to   you   just   as   I   am
