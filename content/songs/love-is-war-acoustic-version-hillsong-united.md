In Your justice and Your mercy
Heaven walked the broken road
Here to fight this sinner's battle
Here to make my fall your own
Turn my eyes to see your face
As all my fears surrender
Hold my heart within this grace
Where burden turns to wonder
I will fight to follow
I will fight for love
To throw my life forever
Into the triumph of the Son
Let Your love be my companion
In the war against my pride
Long to break all vain obsession
Till You're all that I desire
Turn my eyes to see your face
As all my fears surrender
Hold my heart within this grace
Where burden turns to wonder
I will fight to follow
I will fight for love
To throw my life forever
Into the triumph of the Son
And I know Your love has won it all
You took the fall to embrace my sorrows
I know You took the fight
You came and died but the grave was borrowed
I know You stood again
So I can stand with a life to follow
In the light of Your Name
Turn my eyes to see your face
As all my fears surrender
Hold my heart within this grace
Where burden turns to wonder
I will fight to follow
I will fight for love
To throw my life forever
Into the triumph of the Son
Your love has won it all
You took the fall to embrace my sorrows
I know You took the fight
You came and died but the grave was borrowed
I know You stood again
So I can stand with a life to follow
In the light of Your Name
I will fight to follow
I will fight for love
To throw my life forever
Into the triumph of the son
Your love has won it all
You took the fall to embrace my sorrows
I know You took the fight
You came and died but the grave was borrowed
I know You stood again
So I can stand with a life to follow
In the light of Your Name
