[Intro]
As I look at the world I begin to dream
Of the future
And what's yet to be
Your love so strong for every one
You made us all
In your image
[Pre-Chorus]
And You saved the day
When Jesus came
And You took away
All the sin and shame
You made us right again
You came from God above
The Father's only Son
Saved my soul
Made me new
And now I live for You
My heart is alive and my spirit free
In the Savior
Gave His life for me
By Your Word we will be the light in the world
My Father
Shine Your light in me
