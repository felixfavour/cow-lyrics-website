Time and time again
You've proven you're the same
Your word will never fail
You remain the same
God from age to age
Faithful,just and true
Your word will never fail
You remain the same today
 (Chorus)
Your steadfast love never ceases
Your faithfulness is forever
Your steadfast love never ceases
You change not oh oh Jesus
You change not oh oh Jesus
X2
Love so pure and true
Found my place in you
Your word will never fail
You remain the same
God from age to age
Faithful just, and true
Your word will never fail
You remain the same today
