I will wait for you to move
For your mighty hand to save
When the trouble water rise
You are my hiding place
You are my hiding place
Your walls are salvation
Your gates are praise
Your walls are salvation
Your gates are praise
My deliverer [x3]
Is the lord
Who is like you mighty god
Who can take me from your hand
As i walk with you in freedom
You're the rock on which i stand
You're the rock on which i stand
Your walls are salvation
Your gates are praise
Your walls are salvation
Your gates are praise
