You're the fairest of ten thousand
There's no other I could love
You're the fairest of ten thousand
There's no other I could love
Oh, You're the fairest of ten thousand
There's no other I could love
You're the fairest of ten thousand
There's no other I could love
No, there's no other I could love (There's no other I could love)
There's no other I could love (There's no other I could love)
There's no other I could love (There's no other I could love)
There's no other I could love
You're the fairest of ten thousand
There's no other I could love
You're the fairest of ten thousand
There's no other I could love
There's no other I could love (There's no other I could love)
There's no other I could love

Your love is wild for us
Thank You, Lord, for the way that You love us
