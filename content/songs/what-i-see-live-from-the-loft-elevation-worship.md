[Intro]
Can you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?
'Cause I see lightning, I hear thunder
Something stirring six feet under, hey
Dead things coming back to life again
I believe there's about to be another resurrection
Oh, I see signs and I see wonders
I see bursts of living color
Dead things coming back to life again
I believe there's about to be another resurrection, come alive, come alive
Oh, come alive, hey-hey, hey
Wake up sleeper
He is risen
And wе are risen with Him, yeah
Hallеlujah, it is finished, yeah
See the grave, nobody in it
Dead things coming back to life again
I believe there's about to be another resurrection
