Reach out and touch the Lord
As he goes by
You will find
He's not too busy
To hear your heart’s cry
He is passing by this moment
Your needs he'll supply
Reach out and touch the Lord
As he goes by
Don't miss this moment
You’ve been waiting for a long time
Lift your hands now
Right after you wipe your eyes
You've been singing
Come by here my Lord
Open your heart now
Jesus has been knocking on the door
Out of everyone calling His name
He still makes time for you
And if you need
Need his attention
You know what do
