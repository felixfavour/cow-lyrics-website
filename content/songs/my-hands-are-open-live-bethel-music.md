I wanna move so You can move
Come and do what only You can do
I wanna live in expectation
Of Your kingdom breaking through
I wanna move so You can move
Come and do what only You can do
I wanna live in expectation
Of Your kingdom breaking through
(My hands)
My hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
My hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
And I wanna come to You in boldness
By Your power, I receive
I wanna live in expectation
With You, I'll do greater things
'Cause I believe in greater things
Yeah, my hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
My hands are open, my heart is free
Open the Heavens, rain down on me, fall down on me
