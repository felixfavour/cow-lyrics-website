No I won't fear, no I won't worry
I know You're here, so who can bring me down?
You never leave, You don't forget me
You're listening, even when I don't make a sound
Ohhhhhhoooo, heaven knows that I've never been perfect
Ohhhhhhooooo, there's nothing I can do to deserve it
It's good to be loved by You
It's good to be loved by You
Though my brokenness has seen some days
Your mercy's still brand new
It's good to be loved by You
So good to be loved by You
It don't run out, it's never ending
It goes as far as the east is from the west
Ohhhhhoooo, no I've never found the words to explain it
Ohhhhhhoooo, cause there's nothing in the world so amazing
It's good to be loved by You
It's good to be loved by You
Though my brokenness has seen some days
Your mercy's still brand new
It's good to be loved by You
So good to be loved by You
Yeah, good to be loved by You
How deep, how wide
How long, how high
All day, all night
It's good to be loved by You
How deep, how wide
How long, how high
All day, all night
It's good to be loved by You
It's good to be loved by You
It's good to be loved by You
Though my brokenness has seen some days
Your mercy's still brand new
It's good to be loved by You
It's good to be loved by You
No, Your faithfulness will never fail
You'll always see me through
It's good to be loved by You
So good to be loved by You
It's good to be loved by You
So good to be loved by You
