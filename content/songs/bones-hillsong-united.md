You can take my dry bones
Breathe life into this skin
You called me by name
Raised me to life again
You can calm the oceans
Speak peace into my soul
Take me as I am
Awaken my heart to beat again
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Alive in me
You move in the unseen
You set the captives free
As I stand and sing
You're breaking the chains off me
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Alive in me, alive in me
Alive in me, alive in me
Alive in me, alive in me, alive in me...
