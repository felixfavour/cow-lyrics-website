I believe there is one salvation
One doorway that leads to life
One redemption, one confession
I believe in the name of Jesus Christ, hey
I believe in the crucifixion
By His blood I have been set free
I believe in the resurrection
Hallelujah, His life is death's defeat
All praise to God the Father, all praise to Christ thе Son
All praise to the Holy Spirit, our God has overcomе
The King who was and is and evermore will be
In Jesus' mighty name, I believe
[Post-Chorus]
I believe, I believe
I believe in the hope of Heaven
He's preparin' a place for me
Far beyond what hearts imagine
Ears have heard or eyes have seen
