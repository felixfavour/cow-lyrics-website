From the darkness
I called Your name
Into darkness
Your mercy came
You called me out
Lifted me up
How great is Your love
You bore my weakness
You took my shame
Buried my burdens
In fields of grace
You called me out
Lifted me up
How great is Your love
[Pre-Chorus]
From the heights of heaven
You stepped down to earth
Innocent perfection
Gave Your life for us
We are amazed
We stand in awe
For we have been changed
By the power of the cross
