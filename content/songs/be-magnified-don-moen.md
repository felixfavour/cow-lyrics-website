I have made You too small in my eyes
O Lord, forgive me
And I have believed in a lie
That You were unable to help me
[Refrain]
But now, O Lord, I see my wrong
Heal my heart and show Yourself strong
And in my eyes and with my song
O Lord, be magnified
O Lord, be magnified
[Interlude]
Just sing it with us "Be Magnified!"Be magnified, O Lord (Yes!)
You are highly exalted
And there is nothing You can't do
O Lord, my eyes are on You
Be magnified
O Lord, (
Be
), be magnified
Be magnified, O Lord (Sing it!)
You are highly exalted
And there is nothing You can't do (O Lord!)
O Lord, my eyes are on You
Be magnified
O Lord, be magâ€” (
Be magnified
)
Sing it again "be magnified!"Be magnified, O Lord
You are highly exalted
And there is nothing You can't do
O Lord, my eyes are on You!
O Lord, my eyes are on You
Be magnified
O Lord, be magnified
O Lord, (
Be
), be magnified (We magnify You tonight!)
O Lord, be magnified in our lives! (
Be magnified
)
O Lord, be magnified
O Lord, be magnified
