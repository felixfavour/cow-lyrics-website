Hear our prayer, Spirit, come
How I long for Your sweet touch
On my knees I cry out
Jesus, Savior behold Your child
Like a deer longing for water
My soul yearns
Only You can fill my deep hunger
My heart burns, my heart burns
Hear our prayer, Spirit, come
How I long for Your sweet touch
On my knees I cry out
Jesus, Savior behold Your child
Like a deer longing for water
My soul yearns
Only You can fill my deep hunger
My heart burns, my heart burns
Like a deer longing for water
My soul yearns
Only You can fill my deep hunger
My heart burns, my heart burns
Oceans deep, mountains high
Oh my God, I cannot live without Your love
I cannot live without Your love
