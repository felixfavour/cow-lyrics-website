And God heard Israel's cry
And He sent Moses to Pharaoh to tell him, to let my people go
Sometimes the Pharaoh inside of you is the one that's holding you
Anger, bitterness, self-doubt
Don't you think it's time that you tell your Pharaoh, to let you go?
Your cry has been heard
(I love the Lord)
(He heard my cry, yeah)
Donald Lawrence
(Hmm, yeah)
Tri-City
(Yeah, ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Sir the Baptist
Alright y'all, let's get it
(Mm-hmm-mmm, mmm, mmm)
(I saw the Lord)
Yeah, yeah
(Lord)
(He heard me)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Lord)
(He delivered me from my enemy)
Ooh, ooh-ooh
(Lord)
Mm-hmm
(Lord)
