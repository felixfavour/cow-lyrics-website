We've come alive in You, come alive in You
Ever since You took the shame away
We've come alive in You, come alive in You
And we'll never be the same again
The only one who brings life
Into dead and make it rise again
Takes the old things, makes them brand new
Takes the filthy, makes it clean
I'm singing loud now 'cause we're alive
And You've given us a song to sing
We can't keep silent 'cause there are some
That still need to be set free
Come on sing it, we're getting stronger
We're getting stronger
With You there's greater
Here we go, we've come alive
We've come alive in You, come alive in You
Ever since You took the shame away
We've come alive in You, come alive in You
And we'll never be the same again
We've come alive in You, come alive in You
Ever since You took the pain away
We've come alive in You, come alive in You
And we'll never be the same again
