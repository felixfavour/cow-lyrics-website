I've been held by the Savior
I've felt fire from above
I've been down to the river
And I ain't the same, a prodigal returned
All my hope is in Jesus
Thank God my yesterday's gone
All my sins are forgiven
And I've been washed by the blood
No, I'm no stranger to the prison
I've worn shackles and chains, no-noo
I've been freed and forgiven, yes, I have
I'm not going back
I'll never be the same
That's why I sing...
All my hope is in Jesus
Thank God my yesterday's gone
All my sins are forgiven, yes, they are
And I've been washed by the blood
