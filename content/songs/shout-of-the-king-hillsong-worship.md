I give You praise for You deserve it
I give You praise for what You've done
I give You praise for You are able
I'll give You praise 'til I overcome
I give You praise when the sun is shining
I give You praise in the dark of night
I give You praise when the battle rages
I give You praise 'til it works out right
The shout of the King is among us
God lives here in our praises
The shout of the King is among us
Praise Him, praise Him, praise Him in everything
I give You praise for You deserve it
I give You praise for what You've done
I give You praise for You are able
I'll give You praise 'til I overcome
I give You praise when the sun is shining
I give You praise in the dark of night
I give You praise when the battle rages
I give You praise 'til it works out right
