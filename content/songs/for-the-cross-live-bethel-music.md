The life You gave
Your body was broken
Your love poured out
You bled and You died for me there on that cross
You breathed Your last as You were crucified
You gave it all for me
Hallelujah, what a Savior
Hallelujah, what a Friend
Hallelujah, King forever
We thank You for the cross
There in the ground
Sealed in the darkness
Lifeless laid
The frame of the Fatherâ€™s Son
In agony
Yes, He watched His only Son be sacrificed
And He gave it all for me, yeah
Hallelujah, what a Savior
Hallelujah, what a Friend
Hallelujah, King forever
We thank You for the cross
