When I think of You
I see You dancing, You're dancing
When I think of You
I hear You singing to me
When I think of You
I see You praying, You're praying
When I think of You
I hear You calling for me
Yahweh, there is no one like You, Lord
Yahweh, Hallelujah, we sing
Yahweh, there is no one like You, Lord
Yahweh, Your banner for me
Your banner for me is love
When I think of You
I see You dancing, You're dancing
When I think of You
I hear You singing to me
When I think of You
I see You praying, You're praying
When I think of You
I hear You calling for me
