[Instrumental]
Whether now or then
Death is not my end
I know heaven waits for me
Though the road seems long
I'll never walk alone
And I got all I need to sing
[Pre-Chorus]
I know You love me
I know You found me
I know You saved me
And Your grace will never fail me
And while I'm waiting
I'm not waiting
I know heaven lives in me
Should I suffer long
This is not my home
I know heaven waits for me
And though the night is dark
Heaven owns my heart
And I got all I need to sing
