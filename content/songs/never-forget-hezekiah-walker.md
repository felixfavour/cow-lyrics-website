I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget how you set me free
You paid the price
Laid down your life
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget how you made a way
I'll never forget how you took my place
You paid the price
Laid down your life
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget how you brought me out
I'll never forget how you cancelled all of my doubts
And so I owe
You all the praise
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done for me
I'll never forget what you've done
I'll never forget what you've done
I'll never forget what you've done
I'll never forget what you've done
I'll never forget what you've done
I'll never forget what you've done
I'll never forget what you've done
For me
