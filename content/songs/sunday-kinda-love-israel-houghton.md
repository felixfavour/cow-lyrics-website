Sunday kinda love
Between the two of us
And I just can't get enough
Of the feeling that I get
It's a Sunday kinda love
Like the classic gospel song
You just have to sing along
I wish that everyday were Sunday
Oh happy day
The dark just gave way to the light
That shines when you smile
And your eyes say everything will be alright
It makes me want to say
Thank you LORD for all You've done
And all the love this woman gives to me
She gives me something to believe in
Makes me feel like I'm growing up younger
Heaven in her eyes taking me higher
Heart racing like I'm singing in the choir
I love you like a Sunday morning
It's a Sunday kinda love
Between the two of us
And I just can't get enough
Of the feeling that I get
It's a Sunday kinda love
Like the classic Hawkins song
You just have to sing along
I wish that everyday were Sunday
And it's time
The doors of the church are open wide
And my, my it's
So much better since you changed my life
I know millions didn't make it
They tried to wait until tomorrow
But today I want you to know
That the answer is yes to whenever the question is
Makes me feel like I'm growing up younger
Heaven in your eyes taking me higher
Heart racing like I'm singing in the choir
I love you like a Sunday morning
It's a Sunday kinda love
Between the two of us
And I just can't get enough
Of the feeling that I get
It's a Sunday kinda love
Like the classic Winans song
You just have to sing along
I wish that every day were Sunday
Sure do
Said it's a Sunday kinda love, just the two of us, oh
A Sunday kinda love
We got a love, got a love
That will last forever
We sing our song like a Sunday morning
And I believe, you and me, we will stay together (stay together)
Faithfully, we will keep on loving (we will keep on loving)
Sunday morning (Sunday morning love)
Sunday kinda love (oh, oh, yeah)
Between the two of us
I just can't get enough
It's a Sunday kinda love (Sunday kinda love)
Like the classic gospel song
You just have to sing along (sing along)
I wish that everyday were Sunday
Sunday morning
It's a Sunday kinda love
It's a Sunday kinda love, oh, Sunday
