How I long
To breathe the air of Heaven
Where pain is gone
And mercy fills the streets
To look upon
The One who bled to save me
And walk with Him
For all eternity
There will be a day
When all will bow before Him
There will be a day
When death will be no more
Standing face to face
With He who died and rose again
Holy, Holy is the Lord
And every prayer
We prayed in desperation
The songs of faith
We sang through doubt and fear
In the end, we'll see that it was worth it
When He returns to wipe away our tears, oh
