You wrote a letter and You signed Your name
I read every word of it, page by page
You said that You'd be coming, coming for me soon
Oh, my God, I'll be ready for You
I wanna run on greener pastures
I wanna dance on higher hills
I wanna drink from sweeter waters
In the misty morning chill
And my soul is getting restless for the place where I belong
I can't wait to join the angels and sing my Heaven song
I hear Your 
voice and I catch my breath
"Well done my child, enter in and rest"Tears of joy roll down my cheek
It's beautiful beyond my wildest dreams
I wanna run on greener pastures
I wanna dance on higher hills
I wanna drink from sweeter waters
In the misty morning chill
And my soul is getting restless for the place where I belong
I can't wait to join the angels and sing
