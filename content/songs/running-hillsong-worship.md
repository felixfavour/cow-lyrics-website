Ready at the line looking out
Looking out to all that's ahead
When every heart
Confesses Your Name
We're pressing on towards that day
We're never gonna stop
We're never gonna stop
Letting go of every mistake
Throwing off the chains of restraint
All that will remain
A passion for Your Name
Burning as we run this race
We're never gonna stop
We're never gonna stop
We're never gonna stop
We're never gonna stop
We are running
Chasing after all that You are
We are running
'Cause all that You are
Is all that we want now
Every stride is taken in faith
Every step compelled by Your grace
We're taking up our cross
No matter what the cost
We give it all to go Your way
We're never gonna stop
We're never gonna stop
