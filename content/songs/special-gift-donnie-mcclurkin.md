Heaven sent me a wonderful, very special, beautiful gift
Heaven sent me a very wonderful, supernatural, special friend
When I call Him, He answers prayer
And whenever I need Him, He is right there
And His love has lifted me
Higher than I thought I could ever be
He is so wonderful, beautiful, special, supernatural
Heaven sent me a wonderful, very special, beautiful gift
Heaven sent me a very wonderful, supernatural, special friend
When I was in prison, he set me free
I was blinded in darkness, He let me see
I've been through so many storms, He's brought me through
And the same thing that He did for me, He'll do for you
He is so wonderful, beautiful, special, supernatural
Heaven sent me a wonderful, very special, beautiful gift
Heaven sent me a very wonderful, supernatural, special friend
Jesus
