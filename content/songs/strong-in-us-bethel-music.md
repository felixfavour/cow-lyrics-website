When darkness rises all around us
We will see His glory breaking through the night
The King in all His wonder fills us with His power
Christ in us, the answer, a hope for all the world
Our God is strong in us
His love has overcome
He is alive in us, He is the Risen One
The same power that raised Him up
Is the power that lives in us
Our God is strong in us, our God is strong in us
His promise stands throughout the ages
He will never leave us, we are not alone
Greater than our weakness, He is strong to save us
We will stand victorious, a hope for all the world
Our God is strong in us
His love has overcome
He is alive in us, He is the Risen One
The same power that raised Him up
Is the power that lives in us
Our God is strong in us, our God is strong
