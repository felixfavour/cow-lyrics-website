There's beauty in my brokenness
I've got true love instead of pain
There's freedom though you've captured me
I've got joy instead of mourning
There's beauty in my brokenness
I've got true love instead of pain
There's freedom though you've captured me (there's freedom though you've captured me)
I've got joy (I've got joy instead of mourning)
You give me joy
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
You give me joy
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul (can we all sing it together, come on, there's beauty)
There's beauty in my brokenness
I've got true love instead of pain (I've got true love instead of pain)
There's freedom though you've captured me, yeah
I've got joy instead of mourning
And you give me joy
Down deep in my soul (down deep)
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
I feel your joy, 'cause you give me joy
Down deep in my soul (in my soul)
Down deep in my soul (yeah)
Down deep in my soul (come on)
I've never been so free
Caught in your love for me (you love me)
I never been more secure
Knowing your heart, Lord (so glad he loves me)
Never been so free
Caught in your love for me
I never been more secure
Knowing your heart, Lord (so glad he loves me)
'Cause you give me joy
Down deep in my soul (down deep)
Down deep in my soul (hey)
Down deep in my soul (come on)
Say, you give me joy
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul (in my soul)
Down deep in my soul
Joy unspeakable, stronger
Your glory, what a glory
Release your joy in here
In my soul, in my soul
Say you give me joy
Down deep in my soul (in my soul)
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
You give me joy
Down deep in my soul (yeah)
Down deep in my soul
Down deep in my soul
You give me joy
Down deep in my soul
