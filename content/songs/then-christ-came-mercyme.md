Like a soldier with no armor in the middle of the battle
I was broken, I was broken
It was only gettin' darker in the valley of the shadow
I was hopeless, I was hopeless
[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought that I would ever see the day
When every single chain would break
Or hear the voice of heaven call my name
Then Christ came
Changing everything, He took my sin and shame away
Now every song
I sing will be for him, еver since the momеnt He walked in
Then Christ came
I was searchin' for a reason to believe that I could ever really matter
Ever matter
I was hopin', I was reachin', so desperate for my soul to find its Savior
I need a Savior
Then Christ came
Changing everything, He took my sin and shame away
Now every song
I sing will be for him, ever since the moment He walked in
Then Christ came
Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh
