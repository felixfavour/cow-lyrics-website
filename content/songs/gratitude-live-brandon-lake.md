[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
All my words fall short
I've got nothing new
How could I express
All my gratitude?
I could sing these songs
As I often do
But every song must end
And You never do
So I throw up my hands
Praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King
Except for a heart singing
Hallelujah, hallelujah
