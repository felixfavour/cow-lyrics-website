Hold my hand and walk with me
You're the light that makes me see
And on this path, my soul you lead
Oh, my shepherd, walk with me
I need You more than breath
You're my hope, in You I live
And Angels worship at Your throne
Power and Glory to You alone
My Savior, Glorious One
My Redeemer, living in my heart
Now and forever, Your Kingdom come
Oh, Jesus, Son of God
Jesus, Son of God
I need You more than breath
You're my hope, in You I live
And Angels worship at Your throne
Power and Glory to You alone
My Savior, Glorious One
My Redeemer, living in my heart
Now and forever, Your Kingdom come
Oh, Jesus, Son of God
Oh, Jesus, Son of God
