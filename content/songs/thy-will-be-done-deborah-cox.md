I can't lie and say I
Always understand why
The rain falls on me
And I have to admit, I feel my faith is gone
It's easy to believe when sorrow never comes your way
And when I try to pray, it seems the words they come out wrong
*Bridge*
So everything that matters to me
I give it all to you
'cause I'm tired of the way the crying feels
And just to let you know I have been hurt so many times
So I pray to God that this time loves for real
Hmmm...
Chorus
So even though I can't see what tomorrow may bring
I believe in you 'cause you believe you believe in me
And even when the night makes the light hard to see
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
I can't lie and say I
Always smile but I try
The tears sometimes they come
And nothing people say can ease the pain
