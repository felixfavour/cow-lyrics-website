We serve a God of miracles
Nothing's too hard for Him
Everything is possible
Anything is possible
Nothing's impossible
Let's say
Anything is possible
You're the God of miracles
Everything we speak
By faith we're gonna see
There is nothing You can't do
Every word You say is true
Lord You've never failed
Your people will prevail
We're not afraid of giants
Because they always fall
Lord we know You hear us
Every time we call
Shout if you believe it
'Til еvery wall comes down
Shout becausе you know that
Nothing's impossible
