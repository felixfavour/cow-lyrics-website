O Lord, You are my God
That place belongs to only You
The Author of it all
Consume these pages as You choose
[Refrain]
'Cause if You signed Your name upon my heart
The way that authors always do
Then You must be proud to call me Yours
And I must be made for loving You
[Post-Refrain]
Mm
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
O Lord, You are my God
That claim belongs to only You
The Architect of life
Each breath I draw was drawn by You
[Refrain]
And if dependence runs in Your design
Then who am I outside of You?
Lord, without Your breath I won't survive
So I must be made for trusting You
