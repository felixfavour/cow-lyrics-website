You been my friend for so long. You were right, and I was wrong. I can't repay you all the love you given me. 

You were my friend, when no one cared. I was alone, but you were there. Lord, you're the best thing that ever happened to me. 

I owe it all to you Lord. All I have is you Lord. Take my life and make it what you have it be. For I'm your child and your my father. I'm the clay and your the potter. Lord your the best thing that ever happened to me. 

Borrowed treasures, borrowed dreams, all life's joy, you given me. When trouble comes your always there, to make me smile. So come what may, thy will be done, I love you Jesus, God's only son. Lord you're the best thing that ever happened to me. 

I owe it all to you Lord. All I have is you Lord. Take my life and make it what you have it be. For I'm your child and your my father. I'm the clay and your the potter. Lord your the best thing that ever happened to me.
