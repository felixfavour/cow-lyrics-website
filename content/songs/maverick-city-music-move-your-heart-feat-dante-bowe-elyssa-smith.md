"Move Your Heart"
(feat. Dante Bowe & Elyssa Smith)
Jesus, Jesus
Precious Lord
None on the earth
Nor heavens above
That I have found
More beautiful
You are my treasure
My great reward
And I just wanna move Your heart
It's all I wanna do
I just wanna stand in awe
And pour my love on You
No matter how much it costs
I freely give it all to You
To You
Your love made a way
Oh
Jesus, Jesus
My offering
All my ambitions
My hopes, my dreams
And here's my life, Lord
A sacrifice
Oh, just to bless You
And I just wanna move Your heart
It's all I wanna do
I just wanna stand in awe
And pour my love on You
No matter how much the cost
I freely give it all to You, all to You
And I just wanna move Your heart
Get caught within Your gaze
Right here in Your presence, God
Is where I wanna stay
Oh, just to dwell in Your house
Waste my hours and my days on You
All on You
Is it a fragrance?
Then I'll pour my oil out
Is it a life laid down?
Then here I give my vows
Is it a song I sing?
Then here's every melody
Just tell me what moves You
Just tell me what moves You
Is it a fragrance?
Then I'll pour my oil out
Is it a life laid down?
Then here I give my vows
Is it a song I sing?
Then here's every melody
Oh, just tell me what moves You
Oh, tell me what moves You
Is it a fragrance?
Oh, I'll pour my oil out
Is it a life laid down?
Then here I give my vows
Is it a song I sing?
Then here's every melody
Just tell me what moves You
Oh, tell me what moves You
Oh, I just wanna move Your heart
It's all I wanna do
I just wanna stand in awe
And pour my love on You
No matter how much the cost
I freely give it all to You, all to You (All to You)
(I just) I just wanna move Your heart
Get caught within Your gaze
Right here in Your presence, God
Is where I wanna stay
Oh, just to dwell in Your house
Waste my hours and my days on You
All on You
Is it a fragrance?
Then I'll pour my oil out
Is it a life laid down?
Then here I give my vows
Is it a song I sing?
Then here's every melody
Tell me what moves You (I wanna know, I wanna know)
Tell me what moves You (I wanna know, I wanna know)
Tell me what moves You (I wanna know, I wanna know)
Tell me what moves You (I gotta know, I gotta know)
Tell me what moves You (You're the only thing that matters)
Tell me what moves You (You're the only thing that matters)
Tell me what moves You (I gotta know, I gotta know)
Tell me what moves You (Said tell me what moves You)
Tell me what moves You (I gotta know, I gotta know)
Tell me what moves You (Gotta know, I gotta know)
Tell me what moves You ('Cause I live to please You)
Tell me what moves You (I live to serve You)
Tell me what moves You (And I'm not ashamed of it)
Tell me what moves You (I live to please You)
Tell me what moves You (So tell me what moves You)
I hear the Lord say, "You do, you do, you do"
I hear the Lord say, "It's you, it's you, that moves Me
When you begin to sing
When you begin to be
It's you that moves Me
You without the talent
You without the performance
Oh, I'm so moved by your authenticity, authenticity
You really move Me
You really move Me
You really move Me
You blow Me away
You blow Me away"
He says you blow Him away
You blow Him away
When you just be who you were meant to be
His heart is moved
His heart is moved by you
You blow Him away
You blow Him away
The one who hasn't prayed in awhile
You blow Him away
Yes, you do
You blow Him away
You just that got the divorce
I'm telling you, you blow Him away
You that's been bouncing around from home to home
You blow Him away
You that was adopted
Oh, you blow Him away
It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you
You blow Him away
(I just wanna move Your heart)
I just wanna move Your heart
It's all I wanna do
I just wanna stand in awe
And pour my love on You
No matter how much the cost
I freely give it all to You, all to You (I just wanna move You)
I just wanna move Your heart (Get caught within Your gaze)
Get caught within Your gaze
Right here in Your presence, God
Is where I wanna stay
Oh, just to dwell in Your house
Waste my hours and my days on You
On You
