You mean just what You say
When You say, "Don't be afraid"But every step still feels like falling
You never let me down
When I know whatever tries to take me out
You hold me now
And every time I sing, "Hallelujah"It all comes flooding back
How much I need Your grace
Teach me to brave the darkness
In the courage of Your heart
And I'll never be afraid
'Cause I know I'm not alone
And this dark and winding road
Is paved in all the grace I need
And I know You've had my back
Lord, how often I've lost track and found Your heart
With open arms
And every time I sing, "Hallelujah"It all comes flooding back
How much I need Your grace
Teach me to brave the darkness
In the courage of Your heart
And I'll never be afraid
