I’ll write a song about the things that He has done
I’ll write a song about the beauty I have seen
I’ll write a song about the places I have been
Where I am coming from
Where He has brought me to
And I know someday that
I’ll write a song about how now was just the start
Of all the greatness
That He has in store for me
Oh yeah
There’s so much greatness
That He has in store for me
Songs of joy
Songs of war
Songs that speak of love and life
Music, laughter, peace, and strife
I’ll write songs about them all
There’s so much beauty unseen yet
So much to live for, don’t forget
Living’s not life
Without the One who made it so
Oh no no
I’ll write a song about the things that He has done
I’ll write a song about the beauty I have seen
I’ll write a song about the places I have been
Where I am coming from
Where He has brought me to
And I know someday that
I’ll write a song about how now was just the start
Of all the greatness
That He has in store for me
Oh yeah
There’s so much greatness
That He has in store for me
