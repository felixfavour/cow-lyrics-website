As my knees touch the ground in the morning
May new mercies awake in my soul
For Your grace can rewrite any story
And that grace every day writes my own
Faithful You've been, faithful You are
You never failed to complete what You start
You've always been good, always been kind
You've never let go
You've always been God
When the walls 'round my heart won't surrender
I will pray my way around Jericho
And from season to season I'm singing
For I know Him in whom I have hope
Faithful You've been, faithful You are
You never failed to complete what You start
You've always been good, always been kind
You've never let go
Oh, You've always been God
