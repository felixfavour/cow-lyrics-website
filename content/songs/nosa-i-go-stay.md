i go stay i go wait
till my prayer don prevail
and my faith no go shake cause Jesus never fails
i go pray the fervent prayer of the righteous must avail
God go answer me before i even open mouth to say .....
i go stay i go wait (if Jehosaphat fit turn things around)
till my prayer don prevail
and my faith no go shake cause Jesus never fails (what of me)
i go pray the fervent prayer of the righteous must avail
God go answer me before i even open mouth to say in Jesus name(make i speak in tongues small)
i go stay i go wait
till my prayer don prevail
and my faith no go shake cause Jesus never fails
i go pray the fervent prayer of the righteous must avail
God go answer me before i even open mouth to say in Jesus name
in Jesus name
in Jesus name
in Jesus name
in Jesus name
in Jesus name
in Jesus name
in Jesus name
