And on the shores of my soul I give You permission
To wash my tears away
And take all my disappointment
And fill me with joy once again
Fill me up
Fill me up
Fill me up
Oh, on the shores of my soul I give You permission
Yeah, to wash my tears away
And take all my disappointment
And fill me with joy once again
[Chorus: Jeremy Riddle]
I’m gonna sing out loud
I'm gonna let my voice be heard
'Cause it's a song of victory
And it’s ringing in the earth
(I'm gonna sing)
Oh, I’m gonna sing out loud
Oh, I'm gonna let my voice be heard
'Cause it's a song of victory
And it’s ringing in the earth
It's ringing in the earth, oh
