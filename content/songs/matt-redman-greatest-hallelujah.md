There's a hallelujah an everlasting song
A never ending anthem we sing to you alone
Resounding in the heavens and in our hearts today
How greatly we're forgiven and how great
How great will be your praise
And with this song I will rise for the honor of your name
From this breath to my last then forever and a day
I'll pour out my heart I'll pour out my soul
My greatest hallelujah
Alpha and omega beginning and the end
Author of salvation a father and a friend
You thunder and you whisper your glory fills the skies
Worthy you are worthy
Let your name your name be lifted high
And with this song I will rise for the honor of your name
From this breath to my last then forever and a day
I'll pour out my heart I'll pour out my soul
My greatest hallelujah
My greatest hallelujah
There's a moment coming a day above them all
When we will stand in glory and see the face of god
Sing holy holy holy holy is the lord
And bring our hallelujahs for you reign
You reign forevermore
We'll bring our hallelujahs for you reign
You reign forevermore
And with this song I will rise for the honor of your name
From this breath to my last then forever and a day
I'll pour out my heart I'll pour out my soul
My greatest hallelujah
And with this song I will rise for the honor of your name
From this breath to my last then forever and a day
I'll pour out my heart and I'll pour out my soul
My greatest hallelujah
My greatest hallelujah
And we will sing hallelujah
Forever sing hallelujah
Your people sing hallelujah
Forever sing hallelujah
And we will sing hallelujah
Forever sing hallelujah
Your people sing hallelujah
Forever sing hallelujah
And we will sing hallelujah
Forever sing hallelujah
Your people sing hallelujah
Forever sing hallelujah
And we will sing hallelujah
Forever sing hallelujah
Your people sing hallelujah
Forever sing hallelujah
And we will sing hallelujah
Forever sing hallelujah
Your people sing hallelujah
Forever sing hallelujah
