Dark skies, bright as all this future
The music never died
And despite all the rumors there's life in these bones
Best believe the best is yet to come
Open up the doors, watch the tables turn
Let the bride ring in the sound of a brand new world
Better let the night know
Our hope doesn't set with the sun
The Light of the world is hеre
Shining now in all this future
Stir up the lifе in these bones
Don't let the fire go cold now
The Light of the world is here
Shining now in all this future
Stir up the life in these bones
And don't let the fire go out
End times, headlines, all this future
Apocalypse, wow, watch the fear turn to wander
The Times
 will wash out, but Your Word lasts forever
So here's to the end of the world as we know it
Young men, old men, don't quit dreaming
And don't go quiet now, prophesy all your daughters
The world spins left, right (Left, right)
But I hope for so much higher
