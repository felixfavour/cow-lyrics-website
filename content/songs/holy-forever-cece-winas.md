  A thousand generations falling down in worship
  To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
  And all who've gone before us and all who will believe
  Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
  
  
  Your name is the highest
  Your name is the greatest
  Your name stands above them all
  All thrones and dominions
  All powers and positions
  Your name stands above them all
  
  
  And the angels cry, ho-ho-holy
  All creation cries, ho-ho-holy
  You are lifted high, ho-holy
  Holy forever
  
  
  If you've been forgiven and if you've been redeemеd
  Sing the song forever to thе Lamb
  If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name
  Sing the song forever to the Lamb
  Sing the song forever and amen
