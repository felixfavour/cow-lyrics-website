In the stillness of my soul
Is a loud cry to you
Before you i stand
Helpless, vulnerable
Unworthy is my state
But your love says to me
Child be bold and come
Father, here i am
Gyara ni Ya Yesu na (please fix me Lord)
In zama kamar da kai (that i may become more like you)
Gyara ni Ya Yesu na (please fix me Lord)
Gyara ni ma aiâ²kin ka (fix me for your service)
Gyara ni Ya Yesu na (please fix me Lord)
In zama kamar da kai (that i may become more like you)
Gyara ni Ya Yesu na (please fix me Lord)
Gyara ni masoyi na (fix me my lover)
