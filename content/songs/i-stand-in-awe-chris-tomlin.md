When I consider what You have made
The mighty oceans, the fiery stars
The fields and forests give You praise
My Lord, my God
[Chorus: Nicole Serrano]
I stand in awe
I stand in awe
I stand in awe of You
When I consider what You have done
I see Your suffering, I see Your scars
Oh, the wonder, and oh, the love
My Lord (My Lord), my God (My God)
[Chorus: Nicole Serrano & Chris Tomlin]
And I stand in awe
Yes, I stand in awe
I stand in awe of You
[Bridge: Nicole Serrano & Chris Tomlin]
All glory, all honor
All worship and all praise
All blessing, all power
How worthy is Your name
All glory (All glory), all honor (All honor)
All worship and all my praise (All my praise)
All blessing (All blessing), all power (All power)
Is Yours
All the power is Yours
