There is coming a day when no heartaches shall come, no more clouds in the sky, no more tears to dim the eye. All is peace forever more, on that happy golden shore, what a day, glorious day that will be. 

What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see, and I look at my face the One who saved me by His grace. When he takes me by the hand, and leads me through the Promised Land, what a day, glorious day that will be. 

There'll be no sorrow there, no more burdens to bear; no more sickness no pain, no more parting over there. And forever I will be with the One who died for me, what a day glorious day that will be. 

What a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see, and I look at my face the One who saved me by His grace. When he takes me by the hand, and leads me through the Promised Land, what a day, glorious day that will be.
