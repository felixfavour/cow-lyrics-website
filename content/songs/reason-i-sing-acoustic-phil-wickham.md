[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
You pulled me from darkness
And clothed me in garments of praise
Jesus, forever
My song will be You
Yeah!
I'm living in freedom
You've taken my burdens away
Jesus, forever
My song will be You
Only for You, oh
For the cross that You bore (Oh)
And the debt that You paid
For the victory You won over death and the grave (Oh, oh)
This is the reason I sing (Oh)
For the hope that You give
And the joy that You bring
For the promise that Heaven is waiting for me (Oh, oh)
This is the reason I sing
