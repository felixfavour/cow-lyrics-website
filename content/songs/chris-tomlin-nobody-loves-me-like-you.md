Morning,I see you in the sunrise every morning it's like a picture painted for me love letter in the sky
Story I could have had a really relative story but you came down from heaven to restore me, forever save my life
chorus
Nobody loves me like you love me Jesus
I stand in all of your amazing ways
I worship you as long as I am breathing
God you are faithful and truth
Nobody loves me like you
Mountains, you ve broken down  the way to ??? mountains, even when it feels like am surrounded
You never leave my side oh oh oh oh
 Oho oho what a song to sing4
My heart keep singing
I never stop oho what a song to sing
Jesus you love me and I love you back
God I will worship you ,forever worship you
Am a child of God
Yes I am
