Favour! It surrounds you like a shield
It will cover you from now
Until the day you see your King
Lift your voice and shout "favour"

Favour! It surrounds you like a shield
It will cover you from now
Until the day I see your King
Shout it louder, favour!

Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
The next one

Power, it's erupting from within
It is moving me from now
Until the day I see my king

Power, it's erupting from within
It is moving me from now
Until the day I see my king
One more time, power!

Power, it's erupting from within
It is moving me from now
Until the day I see my king

Fire
Fire
Fire
Fire

Fire, it is burning in my soul
It is driving me from now
Until the day I see my kind
Shout fire!

Fire, it is burning in my soul
It is driving me from now
Until the day I see my king
One more time, fire!
Fire, it is burning in my soul
It is driving me from now
Until the day I see my king
The next one now
Angels, the are all around me now
They are following me from now
Until the day I see my king
Angels, the are all around me now
They are following me from now
Until the day I see my king
See what you are saying
You are surrounded, angels
Angels, the are all around me now
They are following me from now
Until the day I see my king
One more time, shout it!
Angels, the are all around me now
They are following me from now
Until the day I see my king
Mercy oh!
Mercy, it has washed away my sin
And it is opening doors for me
Until the day I see my king
Mercy oh!
Mercy, it has washed away my sin
And it is opening doors for me
Until the day I see my king
Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
One more time
Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
One last time, say!
Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
It will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King
