[Intro]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
There were walls between us
By the cross, You came and broke them down
You broke them down
And there were chains around us
By Your grace, we are no longer bound, no longer bound
[Pre-Chorus]
You called me out of the grave
You called me into the light
You called my name and then my heart came alive
Your love is greater, Your love is stronger
Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me
Your love is greater, Your love is stronger
Your love awakens, awakens, awakens me
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Feel the darkness shaking
All the dead are coming back to life, oh, back to life
Hear the song awaken
All creation singing, "We're alive, 'cause You're alive"
