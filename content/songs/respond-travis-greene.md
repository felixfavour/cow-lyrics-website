You see all
Still You're searching
For someone who will respond
I'm right here
You sit high
Still You're looking
For somewhere You could abide
I'm right here
I'm the one
You don't have to search no more
Oh, I'm the one You're looking for
When You call me, I will respond, yeah
When You call me, I will respond
When You pull me, I will come running to Your arms
I will respond to You
(You see all)
You see all
Still You're searching
For someone who will respond
(I'm right here)
I'm right here
(You sit high)
You sit high
Still You're looking
For a place You can abide
(I'm right here)
I'm right here
(Oh, Jesus, I'm the one)
One (yeah)
