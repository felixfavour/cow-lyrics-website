Bread of Life?
Sent down from glory
Many things You were on earth
A holy King, a Carpenter?
But You are the living Word
[Choir:] (2 times)
Bread of heaven?
Sent down from glory
Many things you were on earth
A holy king, a carpenter?
But you are the living Word
(2 times)
Awesome Ruler, gentle Redeemer
God with us, the living Truth
And what a friend we have in You
You are the living Word
(3 times)
Jesus, Jesus that's we call You
Manger born but on a tree
You died to save humanity
You are the living Word
Ooohh, Ooohhhh, Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhh
You are the living word (Repeat 3 times)
(3 times to end)
Jesus, Jesus, that's we call You
Jesus, Jesus, Ooooooooohhhhhhhh
You are the living Word
