I've tried my best to sustain what You started
But my back couldn't carry the weight
So I'm tracing my steps to the moment I lost my way
I'm replacing control for surrender
In Your kindness, there's joy to repent
So I turn my eyes up to the Heavens where my song began
[Chorus: Jenn Johnson]
Through every season You've been my strength
And with all my heart, I'll trust You, Lord
You have been faithful and You've been my song
With all my heart, I'll praise You, Lord
I've got scars on my feet from the miles
I've seen trouble, but I've seen revival
I've seen peace overcoming the chaos with just one word
And I have walked through the valley of shadows
And sang my way through the darkest of nights
I've held onto Your every word and I will survive
