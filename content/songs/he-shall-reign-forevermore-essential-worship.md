In the bleak mid-winter, all creation groans
For a world in darkness, frozen like a stone
Light is breaking, in a stable for a throne
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
Unto us a Child is born
The King of kings and Lord of lords
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
If I were a wise man, I would travel far
If I were a shepherd, I would do my part
But poor as I am, I will give to Him my heart
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
Unto us a Child is born
The King of kings and Lord of lords
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
[Bridge]
Here within a manger lies
The One who made the starry skies
This baby born for sacrifice
Christ, the Messiah!
Into our hopes, into our fears
The Saviour of the world appears
The promise of eternal years
Christ, the Messiah!
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
And He shall reign forevermore, forevermore
