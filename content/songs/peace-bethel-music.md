When my mind is like a battlefield
And my heart is overcome by fear
And hope seems like a ship that's lost at sea
My enemies on every side
And I'm tempted to run and hide
Your gentle whisper reaches out to me
Peace holds me when I'm broken
Sweet peace that passes understanding
When the whole wide world is crashing down, I fall to my knees
And breathe in Your peace
Fiery arrows whistling
The terror of the night sets in
But I can feel Your angels all around
I am resting underneath
The shelter of Your mighty wings
Your promises are where my hope is found, all my hope is—
Peace holds me when I'm broken
Sweet peace that passes understanding
When the whole wide world is crashing down, I fall to my knees
And breathe in Your peace
