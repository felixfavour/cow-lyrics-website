Fill my lungs with the wind of Your spirit
Breath to breath I'm dependant on You
Faithful God You are calling me closer
[Pre-Chorus]
When morning dawns
And evening fades
I need Your grace
Let every breath I breathe
Pour out in praise toward the King
Jesus forever true
My every breath will worship You
Tame my fears as I lean on Your Spirit
Trusting all of my heart unto You
Let Your passion burn like a fire in my soul
[Pre-Chorus 2]
When morning dawns
And evening fades
I’ll seek Your face
