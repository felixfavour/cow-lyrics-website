Let now the weak say I have strength
By the Spirit of power
That raised Christ from the dead
Let now the poor stand and confess
That my portion is Him
And I'm more than blessed
[Pre-Chorus]
Let now our hearts burn with a flame
A fire consuming all for Your Son's holy Name
And with the heavens we declare
You are our King
We love You Lord
We worship You
You are our God
You alone are good
Let now Your church shine as the bride
That You saw in Your heart
As You offered up Your life
And now the lost be welcomed home
By the saved and redeemed
Those adopted as Your own
