We join with the angels' adoration
We bow casting down our golden crowns
And we call to the Father God Almighty
We cry holy holy holy
Holy You are holy
Holy You are holy
Holy You are holy
O Lord yes You are holy
[Bridge]
Holy is the One who was
And is and is to come
Holy is the One who was
And is and is to come again
