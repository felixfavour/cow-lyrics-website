There is power in His name
For the stone was rolled away
Mountains bow down before
Jesus Christ, our risen Lord
Jesus Christ, our risen Lord
Mighty Savior, lifted high
King forever, Jesus Christ
Crowned in glory, raised to life
The same power lives in us
We will rise, stand and sing
Of our great and matchless King
Seated high on the throne
You shall reign forevermore
You shall reign forevermore
Mighty Savior, lifted high
King forever, Jesus Christ
Crowned in glory, raised to life
The same power lives in us
The grave could not contain
The power of His name
Death, You overcame
Once and for all
