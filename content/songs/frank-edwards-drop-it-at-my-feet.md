eleleya Eleleleya Eleleleya Eleleleya
I am the Lord
I heard Your cry
No need to worry
No need to fear anymore
Bring it all bring it all
Drop it at My feet
It doesn't matter what the doctor said to you
Drop it at My feet
It doesn't matter what you've been told
Drop it at My feet
They have been there for ten years or more
Drop it at My feet
Eleleleya Eleleleya
Nso nso gi Buchi (Eleleleya)
I laid My life just that you might be free
I bled and died but then I rose again
Drop it at My feet
The gate of Hell could not prevail
Drop and walk away
Bring it on
The doctor said there is no hope for you
Drop it at My feet
They said you cannot walk again
Drop it at My feet
It doesn't matter what they said to you
Drop it at My feet
Drop and walk away
Drop it at My feet and walk away
Drop it at My feet
Drop it at My feet and walk away
Drop it at My feet
Drop it at My feet
