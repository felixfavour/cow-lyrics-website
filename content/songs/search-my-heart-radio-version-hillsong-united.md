Search my heart
And search my soul
There is nothing else
That I want more
Shine Your light
And show Your face
In my life
Lord have Your way
So with all my heart and all my soul
With all I am, Lord, I will follow You (first time v3)
You took the cross, You took my shame
Restored my life, now I live to worship You
Hear my cry
And hear my prayer
Draw me close
I know you're near
So with all my heart and all my soul
With all I am, Lord, I will follow You (first time v3)
You took the cross, You took my shame
Restored my life, now I live to worship You
