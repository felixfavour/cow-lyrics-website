Yea though I walk
Through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
For the Lord is my rod, is my staff
Yea though I walk
Through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
For the Lord is my rod, is my staff
He's a strong tower
He's a strong tower
He's a strong tower
He's a strong tower
Yea though I walk
Through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil
For the Lord is my rod, is my staff
He's a strong tower
He's a strong tower
He's a strong tower
He's a strong tower
He's a mighty fortress
Hе's a mighty fortress
He's a mighty fortress
Hе's a mighty fortress
He's a solid rock
He's a solid rock
He's a solid rock
He's a solid rock
