God loves me, adores me
Watches over me, you are for me
Grace loved me, and it’s not what I deserved
And nothing that I’ve earned
But daily
Grace saves me.
[Chorus:]
Oh but for your grace
Oh but for your grace
Oh but for your grace
I’d be lost but for your grace
God loves me, adores me
Watches over me, you are for me
And grace love me but it’s not what I deserve
And nothing that I’ve earned
But daily
Grace saves me.
[Chorus:]
Oh but for your grace
Oh but for your grace
Oh but for your grace
I’d be lost but for your love
I’d be lost but for your love
