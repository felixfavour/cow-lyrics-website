Let's Go!
From the Earth to the stars
From the depths of the sea
Creation reveal your majesty
From the dust of the ground
By the works of your hand
You formed us to man after your image
[Build]
Your power is second to none
Your throne is established
And its everlasting
You're clothed in majesty (clothed in majesty)
Let the God of creation be praised
Let the God of creation be praised
Let the heavens rejoice for he reigns
Let the heavens rejoice for he reigns
Lift your praise with your voice to the king
Lift your praise with your voice to the king
Blow the trumpet in Zion
Mighty is He
