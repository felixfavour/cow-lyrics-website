y he could preach that man spoke of things
of heaven yet still on this earth
He stood on that hill, from morning until
You could see the hunger in our eyes
I turned to my mama, I asked what we should do
Cause all we had were morsels left
Something told me that my momma believed
This preacher could use it more than me
Oh I'm tryna to let go
My heart is uneasy, I give you control
I know it's not much but I know what I owe
I'll give you all of my fishes and loaves
I saw His disciples
They were there to
Witness the water turn wine
They've seen with their eyes
The lame man arise
So I walked up to them and I said
Oh I'm tryna to let go
My heart is uneasy, I give you control
I know it's not much but I know what I owe
I'll give you all of my fishes and loaves
They brought me to the man
I put the food in his hand
Held back my questioning thoughts
Something told me that the preacher could
See the war between my head and heart
When he said
Oh my child let go
I know you're uneasy, but I'm in control
I don't need that much for me to show
I'll make the most of your fishes and loaves
