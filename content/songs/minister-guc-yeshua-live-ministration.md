Jesus, Lover of my soul
Jesus, I will never let You go
You've taken me from the miry clay
You've set my feet upon the rock
And now I know
I love you
I need you
Though my world may fall
I'll never let You go
My Savior
My closest Friend
I will worship You
Till the very end
Yeshua
Yeshua
My Beloved is the most beautiful
Amongst thousands and thousands
My Beloved is the most beautiful
Amongst thousands and thousands
My Beloved is the most beautiful
Amongst thousands and thousands
My Beloved is the most beautiful
Amongst thousands and thousands
And thousands
And thousands
My Beloved is the most beautiful
Among thousands and thousands
My Beloved is the most beautiful
Among thousands and thousands
My Great Physician is the most beautiful
Among thousands and thousands
My Beloved is the most beautiful
Among thousands and thousands
