In Bethlehem, one holy night
A host of angels filled the sky
They sang to tell
The world who waits
Our Savior comes
This Christmas Day
God is with us
Christ our Savior
Jesus our Emmanuel
He shall reign our King forever
The hope of Israel
The wise men traveled from afar
They followed close a shining star
With costly gifts before Him lay
Our King was born
This Christmas Day
God is with us
Christ our Savior
Jesus our Emmanuel
He shall reign our King forever
The hope of Israel
