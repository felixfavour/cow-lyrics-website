I've lived stories that have proved Your faithfulness
I’ve seen miracles my mind can't comprehend
And there is beauty in what I can't understand
Jesus, it’s You
Jesus, it's You
I believe
You're the wonder-working God
You're the wonder-working God
All the miracles I've seen
Too good to not believe
You're the wonder-working God
And You heal because You love
Oh, the miracles we'll see
You're too good to not bеlieve
Too good to not beliеve
Too good to not believe
I can’t resurrect a man with my own hands
But just the mention of Your name can raise the dead
Oh, all the glory to the only one who can
Jesus, it’s You
Oh, Jesus, it's You
Yes, I believe
