There is a light
It burns brighter than the sun
He steals the night and casts no shadow
There is hope
Should oceans rise and mountains fall
He never fails
So take heart
Let His love lead us through the night
Hold on to hope
Take courage again
In death by love
The fallen world was overcome
He wears the scars of our freedom
In His name
All our fears are swept away
He never fails
So take heart
Lеt His love lead us through the night
Hold on to hopе
And take courage again
