Give thanks with a grateful heart
Give thanks to the Holy One
Give thanks because He's given
Jesus Christ His Son
Give thanks with a grateful heart
Give thanks to the Holy One
Give thanks because He's given
Jesus Christ His Son
And now let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Because of what the Lord has done for us
And now let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Because of what the Lord has done for us
Give thanks with a grateful heart 
(With a grateful heart)
Give thanks to the Holy One 
(To the Holy One)
Give thanks because He's given
Jesus Christ His Son
Give thanks with a grateful heart 
(With a grateful heart)
Give thanks to the Holy One 
(To the Holy One)
Give thanks because He's given
Jesus Christ His Son
