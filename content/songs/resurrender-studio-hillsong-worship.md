You're turning over tables
And calling for return
To our lives upon the altar
The things we did at first
You're clearing out the temple
You're cleaning out the dirt
For we are Your territory
Lord, we are Your Church
We are Your people
You are our God
We are Your temple
Make us holy like You are
You see a holy nation
A flock to consecrate
A chosen generation
A people called to pray
So help us, God, to plеase You
Where only You can see
For еvery moment matters in eternity
We are Your people
You are our God
We are Your temple
Make us holy like You are
We are Your children
You've set us apart
God, for Your glory
Make us holy like You are
