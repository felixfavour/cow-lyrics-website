Ise tOluwa se o ah (Ko le baje)
And all that's lovely in your life (Ko ni daru)
When it seems like all has ended know (Ko le baje)
Ko le baje, ko le baje o (Ko le baje)
Ko ni daru, ko ni daru o (ko le baje) (2x)
Sittin by my window
Thinkin about my life
It seems so empty
Is it all a lie
Needin some answers
Needin reasons why
The road is so rough
Feelin like I just might die (but)
Repeat One day, one day
One day, I know Ill sing a song
Know Ill tell a story, a song of praise
Ill sing of how I was delivered
How I came from misery to ecstasy
Kole mole, kole mole
Bimo rere, bimo rere
Ire owo lodun modun
Ayo mayo titi aye
