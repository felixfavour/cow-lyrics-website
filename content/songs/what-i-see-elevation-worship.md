[Intro]
Come on, hands up!
Do you see what I see?
Do you see what I see?
Oh, I see lightning, I hear thunder
Something stirring six feet under
Dead things coming back to life again
I believe there's about to be another resurrection
Oh, I see signs and I see wonders
I see bursts of living color
Dead things coming back to life again
I believe thereâ€™s about to be another resurrection, oh
Come alive
Wake up, sleeper
He is risen
We are risen with Him
Yeah!
Oh, hallelujah, it is finished!
See that grave, no body in it (Yeah)
Dead things coming back to life again
I believe there's about to be another resurrection (Resurrection, oh)
