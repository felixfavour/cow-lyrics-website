My victory is in your blood
My confidence is in your name
You took the shame so I can shine
So much you did without a price
ESE
ESE
ESE ooo
Ema ESE
This is not just a lovely song
This is the story of my days
I'm a product of your grace
I won't be here without your love
After all is said and done
I'm who I am because of you
What can I give for all this love
What can I say but give you thanks
