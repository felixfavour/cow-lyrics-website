The nations are waiting (waiting)
The people are hungry o
The Master is in need of vessels
So I pledge my allegiance
To the one who has called me o
I will make Jesus proud
We'll be many o (eh)

Lord, the price that you paid (very costly o)
And the love that you showed (no denying o)
And the prayer that you made (I will answer o)
I will make Jesus proud (we'll be many o)
We'll be many that pray (la la-la, la-la-la, la-la la)
We'll be many that preach (la la-la, la-la-la, la-la la)
We'll be many that fast and heal (la la-la, la-la-la, la-la la)
I will make Jesus proud (we'll be many o)
When you call, when you call, I'll come running o
Hey (we'll be many o)
Oh, Jesus, I've made up my mind to follow, I'll follow You
It is written about me to follow (we'll be many o)
I must work the work of the One who sent me
While it is day, we must work o
Hey, we must work, we must work o
'Til we see Him face to face
The nations are waiting (waiting)
The people are hungry o
The Master is in need of vessels
So I pledge my allegiance (we must work o, we must work o)
To the one who has called me o ('til we see Him face to face)
We'll be many o
The nations are waiting (waiting)
The people are hungry o
The Master is in need of vessels
So I pledge my allegiance
To the one who has called me o
