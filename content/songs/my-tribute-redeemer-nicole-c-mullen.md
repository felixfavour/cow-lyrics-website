How can I say thanks for the things you have done for me
Things so undeserved, yet you gave to prove your love for me
The voices of a million angels could not express my gratitude
All that I am and ever hope to be, yeah
I owe it all right now to thee
To God be the glory
To God be the glory
To God be the glory
For the things He has done
Just let me live my life and let it be pleasing, Lord, to thee
And should I gain, should I gain any praise, let it go to Calvary
Calvary
The very same God that spins things in orbit
He runs to the weary, the worn, and the weak
And the same gentle hands that hold me when I'm broken
They conquer death to bring me victory
Now I know my redeemer lives
See I know my redeemer lives
So let all creation testify, let this life within me cry
I know my redeemer...
