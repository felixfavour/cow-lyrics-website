Our God - Matt Redman
Water you turned into wine
Opened the eyes of the blind
There's no one like you
None like You!
Into the darkness you shine
Out of the ashes we rise
There's no one like you, none like You!
Our God is greater, our God is stronger
God you are higher than any other
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power
Our God! Our God!
Into the darkness you shine
Out of the ashes we rise
There's no one like you
There's none like You!
Our God is greater, our God is stronger
God you are higher than any other
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power, Our God!
Our God!
Our God is greater, our God is stronger
God you are higher than any other
Our God is Healer, Awesome in Power, Our God!
Yes, Our God!
