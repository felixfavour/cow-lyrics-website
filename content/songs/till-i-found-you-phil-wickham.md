I searched through the Earth for something that could satisfy
A peace for the hurt I had buried deep inside
[Pre-Chorus]
Knees on the floor, I finally found everything I needed
You lifted my soul and opened up my eyes
And I never knew anything lasts forever 'til I found You
'Til I found You
I never dreamed anything could be better 'til I found You
'Til I found You
You're rewriting my story
And I'm brand-new like a morning
Oh, I never knew anything lasts forever 'til I found You
[Post-Chorus]
'Til I, 'til I found You
'Til I, 'til I found You
'Til I, 'til I found You
'Til I, 'til I found You
Gone are the days I'm chasing after what won't last
I'm done with building these castles that crumble like sand
