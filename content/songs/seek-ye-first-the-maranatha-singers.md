Seek ye first the kingdom of God
And His righteousness
And all these things
Shall be added unto you
Allelu alleluia
Man shall not live by bread alone
But by every word
That proceeds from the mouth of God
Allelu alleluia
Ask and it shall be given unto you
Seek and ye shall find
Knock and the door shall be
Opened unto you
Allelu alleluia
Seek ye first the kingdom of God
And His righteousness
And all these things
Shall be added unto you
Allelu alleluia
