Where do I go when there's nobody else to turn to?
Who do I talk to when nobody wants to listen?
Who do I lean on when there's no foundation stable?
I go to the rock
I know that stable
I go to the rock
I go to the rock of my salvation
I go to the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain
And the mountain stands by me
And when the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I'll stand
When I need a shelter, when I need a friend
I go to the rock
Where do I go, where do I go
When the storms of life are threatening?
Who do I turn to when the winds of sorrow blow?
Is there a refuge in the time of tribulation
I go to the rock
I know that stable
I go to the rock
I go to the rock of my salvation
I go to the stone that the builders rejected
I run to the mountain
And the mountain stands by me
And when the Earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ the solid rock I'll stand
