Greater is the one who's in us
Greater is the one who calls our name
He will never fail
Stronger is the one within us
Stronger is the one who fights for us
He will never fail
You will never fail
For Your love endures forever
Oh Your love endures forever
Open up our eyes, surround us with Your light
Your love endures forever
Mighty is the one who's for us
Mighty is the one who's strong to save
He will make a way
You will make a way
For Your love endures forever
Oh Your love endures forever
Open up our eyes, surround us with Your light
Your love endures forever
