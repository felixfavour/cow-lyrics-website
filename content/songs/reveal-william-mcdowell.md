[Chorus]
Father we want to know You
Reveal Yourself to us
We've seen You
Through Jesus our Savior
We want to know You more
We're crying out to You
Reveal Yourself

We're crying out to You
Reveal Yourself to us, oh God
Reveal Yourself to us
We want to know You better oh
Say Jesus, Jesus wonderful Savior
You are our hearts desire
We've tasted and seen Your goodness
Now nothing else satisfied
Oh God
We're crying out to You
Reveal Yourself Reveal Yourself
Reveal Yourself
We're crying out to You oh God
Reveal Yourself to us
