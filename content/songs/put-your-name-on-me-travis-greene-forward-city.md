I was a wretch undone
Life in shambles, nowhere to run
Stuck in a world of shame
Everything changed when I called that name
[Chorus: Tony Fresh]
Jesus
Oh, how I love the name, Jesus
Something happens when we call You, You move
You'll never leave us the same
When we call the name
First time I saw You move
Signs and wonders where in the room
My heart was overwhelmed
Your еyes where on mе still
And all of my days
[Chorus: Travis Greene]
I'll shout the name, Jesus
Oh, how I love the name, Jesus
Something happens when we call You, You move
And You'll never leave us the same
When we call the name, Jesus
Oh, how I love the name, Jesus
Something happens when we call You, You move
You'll never leave us the same
When we call the name
