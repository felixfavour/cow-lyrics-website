Holy
No measure knows Your worth
Face down
Where mercy finds me first
[Pre-Chorus]
If You sought perfection
I'd die tryin' to reach it
But this broken heart is all You want
Singin' holy
Heart like heaven
Singin' holy
God Almighty 
own this
Heart broke sound
Singin' holy is Your Name
Singin' holy is Your Name
[Bridge] x2
Own the sound forever
Heart and heaven together
Singin' holy is Your Name
And if it lifts You higher
Burn in me Your desire
A passion worthy of Your Name
