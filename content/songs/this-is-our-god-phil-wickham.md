Remember those walls that we called sin and shame?
They were like prisons that we couldn't escape
But He came, and He died, and He rose
Those walls are rubble now
Remember those giants we called death and grave?
They were like mountains that stood in our way
But He came, and He died, and He rose
Those giants are dead now
This is our God, this is who He is
He loves us
This is our God, this is what He does
He saves us
He bore the cross, beat the grave
Let Heaven and Earth proclaim
This is our God, King Jesus
Remember that fear that took our breath away?
Faith so weak that we could barely pray
But He heard every word, every whisper
