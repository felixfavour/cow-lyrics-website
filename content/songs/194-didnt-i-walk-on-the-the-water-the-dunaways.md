As I kneel in the darkness in the middle of the night I’m praying for assurance everything’s gonna be alright And Lord I see another battle out in front of me I’m afraid I won’t be able and I’ll go down in defeat

And He said, do you remember where I brought you from Just take a look behind you and see how far you’ve come Oh, every time you asked me, didn’t I deliver you So why would you be thinking that I wouldn’t see you through

And didn't I walk on the water and I calmed the raging sea I spoke to the wind, and it hushed and I gave you peace Didn’t I run to your rescue didn’t I hear you when you called I walked right beside you just so you wouldn’t fall Didn’t I leave all of Heaven just to die for your sin I searched until I found you and I’d do it all again

Now she’s talking to her father in a house that was once a home
She said my bills are coming due Lord and six days is not that long
She hears a voice so still and low
He says I’ve moved like that before
I’ll do this little thing child and I’ll give you so much more

And didn't I walk on the water and I calmed the raging sea I spoke to the wind, and it hushed and I gave you peace Didn’t I run to your rescue didn’t I hear you when you called I walked right beside you just so you wouldn’t fall Didn’t I leave all of Heaven just to die for your sin I searched until I found you and I’d do it all again
