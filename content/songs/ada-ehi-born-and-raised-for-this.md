Born And Raised For This
Song by Ada Ehi
I was born and raised for this
Yes, I was made for this
I was born and raised for this
For such a time as this
To know you
Jesus
To love you
Jesus
To worship
Jesus
I was born

I was born and raised for this
Yes was made for this
I was born and raised for this
For such a time as this
To know you Jesus
To love you Jesus
To worship Jesus
To know you Jesus
To love you Jesus
To worship Jesus
I was born

For your testimony
Jesus

For your glory and grace
Jesus
In your presence
Forever to dwell
Jesus

Jesus
