[Intro]
(Eh eh eh ah)
(Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
(Let the worshipper in you wake up)
(Let the worshipper in you wake up)
This is my story
You are my song
All day, all night
I will sing of your faithfulness
This is my story
You are my song
All day, all night
I will sing of your faithfulness
[Chorus: Dunsin Oyekan, 
Lawrence Oyor
]
From my spirit
To my soul
Until my voice
Re-echoes
You are worthy of my worship
Worthy of my praise
From my spirit
To my soul
Until my voice
Re-echoes
You are worthy of my worship
Worthy of my praise
