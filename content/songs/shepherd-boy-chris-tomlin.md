I’m no hero of the faith
I’m not as strong as i once thought i was
I’m just a shepherd boy
Singing to a choir of burning lights
I’m just singing, singing over you
Come and lay your troubles down
‘Cause love is breaking through
I was born to lift a song of hope
See the heavens open up
Take this armor lest i die
Take this crown and let me fly
I’m just singing, singing over you
Come and lay your troubles down
‘Cause love is breaking through
[Bridge][X2]
We’re just singing, singing out to you
Our hearts are yours forever
Your love is breaking through
