A chapter done
Turn the page
And separate roads
Lead separate ways
But as we go, we're not alone
No, we’re not alone
Because faith and hope and love
Are waiting for you when we say goodbye
Where would we be without the Faith
Where would we be without the Hope
Where would we be without the Faith
The one that God alonе has made
Because faith and hopе and love
Are waiting for you when we say
Faith, hope and love
Are waiting for you when we say goodbye
Where would we be without the Faith
Where would we be without the Hope
Where would we be without the Faith
The one that God alone has made
