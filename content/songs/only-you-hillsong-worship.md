On the mountain in the valley
Ev'rywhere I go
You are with me right beside me
You never let me go
The Messiah the Almighty
Saviour of my soul
Saviour of my soul
In the daylight in the shadow
Your faithfulness untold
You surround me and protect me
Guiding as I go
The Messiah the Almighty
Saviour of my soul
Saviour of my soul
(Pre-Chorus)
There is nowhere I can run
There is nowhere I can hide
And if I ever lose my way
You're calling out my name
You're calling out my name
(REPEAT)
Jesus
