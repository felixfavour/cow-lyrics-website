[Bridge]
Yeah, You
You make all things new
Yes, You make all things new
And I will follow You (And I will follow You forward)
I will follow You
Everybody say: "You make all things new, yeah" (You make all things new)
After You, You're changing me (Yes, You make all things new)
You're making me over and over and over (And I will follow You forward)
I will follow You
I will follow after You, yeah (You make all things new)
Hey, You make (Yes, You make all things new)
Somebody tell the Lord: "I will, I will, I will follow after You, yeah" (And I will follow You forward)
Sing: "You make all things new, yeah" (You make all things new)
You makе (Yes, You make all things new)
And I will follow (And I will follow You forward)
[?] (You makе all things new)
We empty out ourselves to You, Lord (Yes, You make all things new)
We lay down ourselves today (And I will follow You forward)
Down at Your feet in worship, yeah
Everybody say: "You make all things" (You make all things new)
You make (Yes, You make all things new)
And I will, I'll follow You, I'm running, I'm chasing after You (And I will follow You forward)
I gotta have, I gotta have (You make all things new)
You make (Yes, You make all things new)
And I will follow You, forward (And I will follow You forward)
