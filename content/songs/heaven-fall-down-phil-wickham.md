[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Open our eyes, Lord, let us see
All that You are, all that You mean
Open our ears, Lord, let us hear
All that You are, be loud and clear
Please, be near
[Pre-Chorus]
As our praises rise
May Your presence fall
Heaven, Heaven fall down
Spirit, Spirit pour out
On us all now
Heaven fall down
Come, Jesus, come, come like the wind
Fill up this place, we welcome You in
Come, Jesus, come, come like the rain
Open the sky, show us Your face
Oh, Lord, we'll wait
