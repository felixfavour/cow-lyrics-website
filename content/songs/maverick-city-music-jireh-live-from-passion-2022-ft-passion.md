Verse 1: Chandler Moore]
I'll never be more loved than I am right now
Wasn't holding You up
So, there's nothing I can do to let You down
It doesn't take a trophy
To make You proud
I'll never be more loved than I am right now, oh
Going through a storm, but I won't go down
I hear Your voice carried
In the rhythm of the wind to call me out
You would cross an ocean so I wouldn't drown
You've never been closer than You are right now.
Jireh, You are enough
Jireh, You are enough
And I will be content
In every circumstance
Jireh, You are enough
[Post-Chorus: Naomi Raine & Chandler Moore]
Forever enough, always enough
More than enough
Forever enough, always enough
More than enough
I don't wanna forget how I feel right now
On the mountaintop
I can see so clear what it's all about
So stay by my side when the sun goes down
Don't wanna forget how I feel right now
Jireh, You are enough
Jireh, You are enough
I will be content
In every circumstance
Jireh, You are enough.
Post-Chorus: Chandler Moore & Naomi Raine]
Forever enough, always enough
More than enough
Forever enough, always enough
More than enough

I'm already loved
I'm already chosen
I know who I am
I know what You've spoken
I'm already loved
More than I could imagine
And that is enough
[Refrain 1: Chandler Moore, (Naomi Raine)]
That is enough

If He dresses the lilies
With beauty and splendor
How much more will He clothe you
How much more will He clothe you
If He watches over
Every sparrow
How much more does He love you
How much more does He love you.
[Refrain 2: Chandler Moore & Naomi Raine]
It's more than you ask, think, or imagine
According to His power working in us
It's more than enough
