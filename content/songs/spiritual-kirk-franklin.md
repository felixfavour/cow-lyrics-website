[Intro]
Woah
It hurts me to see you give up
'Cause the battle is not flesh and blood
It's all a delusion to live in confusion
So you gotta set your mind on things above
Don't forget who's the real enemy
And they hate you've been granted victory
But still life feels wrong, you can't fix it on your own
You'll never be free if you live by what you see
So over and over and over again
Remind yourself when your flesh wants to win (Jesus)
It's not about me
This is not my home
And everything's spiritual
Yes, it's all spiritual
Help me to see
That I don't belong here
'Cause I am spiritual
You make me spiritual
Me
(Let's go)
