I don't see nothing but your love
I'm blind
I don't see nothing but your love
I'm blind
I don't see nothing but your love
I'm blind yeah
I don't see nothing but your love
I'm blind yeah
They say there is a casting down
But all I can see is a lifting up
You lifted me from out of the gutter
Look where am at now four years after
I don't see nothing else but God's love
I don't know nothing else but His love
Who you think picks me up when I fall
Even when I was undeserving of love
Oh my God
You where the greatest I know
You give reason to flow
I cannot even stop
Not even you pull my
The glory is always your own
Oh my God
Thou A thousand may fall at my left side
A thousand may fall at my right
Though everybody is complaining but I'm not complaining
But they don't know it's because
I don't see nothing but your love
I'm blind
I don't see nothing but your love
I'm blind
I don't see nothing but your love
I'm blind
I don't see nothing but your love
I'm blind
What can I do without your love
Where would I be without your love
I cannot live without your love
My God o
What can I do without your love
Who would I be without your love
Where would I be without your love
My God o
I can't see nothing but your love
I'm blind
I can't see nothing but your love
I'm blind
I can't see nothing but your love
I'm blind
I can't see nothing but your love
I'm blind
I'm blind o
I say I'm blind o
I don't see what you see
I see the love of God o
I'm blind o
I'm really blind o
Cos I don't see the things you see
But just the love of God yeah
