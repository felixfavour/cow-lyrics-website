I sit and look back in retrospect
On how can I expect, to justify one reason to love You
It almost seems like distrespect oh when I recollect on how many reasons
Just why I should love you
Lord you purchased my salvation
But it's more than that
Brought me in and out of season
But it's more than that
You knew and loved me before creation
But it's more than that
My love just can't find one reason
It's more than that
