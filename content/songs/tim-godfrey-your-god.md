Bring it all to me
I see how much you have Cried
I know how Hard
You have Tried, I Am Your God
You can Talk to me
My Yoke is so Easy
If only you Trust me
I am Your God, Fix your Eyes on me
The Storm Might be Raging
I know You Might be Sinking
I am Your God
Lay it at my Feet
[Pre  Chorus]
I know you've done all you can
No One Understands
I am your God
Oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, Ooh, oh

I am here for You
My Arms are Wide Open
I won't give up on You
Forever I Love You

Bring it all to me
I see how much you have Cried
I know how Hard
You have Tried, I Am Your God
You can Talk to me

My Yoke is so Easy
If only you Trust me
I am Your God, Fix your Eyes on me
The Storm Might be Raging
I know You Might be Sinking
I am Your God
Lay it at my Feet
[Pre  Chorus]
I know you've done all you can
No One Understands
I am your God
Oh, oh, oh, Ooh, oh, Ooh, oh

I am here for You
My Arms are Wide Open
I won't give up on You
Forever I Love You
I am here for You
My Arms are Wide Open
I won't give up on You
Forever I Love You
[Bridge]
No matter where you are
The Hurt you Feel Inside
The Pain, the Shame
They won't go Away, away

I am here for You
My Arms are Wide Open
I won't give up on You
Forever I Love You
I am here for You
My Arms are Wide Open
I won't give up on You
Forever I Love You
I am here for You
My Arms are Wide Open
I won't give up on You
Forever I Love You
[Outro]
I'm Running back to You
And I Surrender all to You
I give my all to You
Forever I Love You
I give my all to YOU
