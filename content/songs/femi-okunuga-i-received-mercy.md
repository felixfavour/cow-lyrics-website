According to
your never-ending love
I receive mercy,
My eyes have seen mercy
And by the blood
of the lamb that was slain for me
I receive mercy,
my eyes have seen mercy.
(According to your never ending love)
According to
your never-ending love
I receive mercy,
My eyes have seen mercy
And by the blood
of the lamb that was slain for me
I receive mercy,
my eyes have seen mercy.
(Oh, Lord I am grateful)
Lord , I am grateful for your kindness
I'm grateful for your grace
You shed your blood that I might live
Where would I be if not for you
Chorus:
Mo dupe
Mo ri anu gba (4x)
Verse 2:
My soul was depraved, yet you brought me into light
I receive mercy
My eyes have seen mercy.
When I was in the Dark Lord you rescued me
I receive mercy
my eyes have seen mercy
Lord, I am grateful for your kindness
I'm grateful for your grace
You shed your blood that I might live
Where would I be if not for you
Chorus:
Mo dupe
Mo ri anu gba (4x)
Vamp:
I'm grateful for your mercy
I'm grateful for your grace
