Hail Jesus! You're my King!
Your life frees me to sing
I will praise You all my days
You're perfect in all Your ways
Hail Jesus! You're my Lord!
I will obey Your word
Because I want to see
Your kingdom come
Not my will by Yours be done
Glory, glory to the Lamb!
You will take us into the land
We will conquer in Your name
And proclaim that "Jesus reigns!"Hail, hail Lion of Judah!
How wonderful You are!
Hail, hail Lion of Judah!
How powerful You are!
Hail Jesus! You're my King!
Your life frees me to sing
I will praise You all my days
You're perfect in all Your ways
