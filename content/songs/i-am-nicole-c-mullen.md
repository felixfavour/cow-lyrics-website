At the end of every rainbow
There's a promise proven true
No matter how you're feeling now or what you go through
There will be somebody lovin' you
Deeper than the grandest canyon
And higher than the open sky
Near enough to capture every whisper, every sigh
Strong enough to hold you when you cry
I Am, I was, I am the one who is to come, Yeah
Before and after, I'll still be what I am and what I was
All that you need, All that you want
I Am
If you need someone to hold you
Because your world's fallin' apart
If you need a light to guide you safely through the dark
And chase away the nightmares of the heart
If you need someone to give you
A purpose for your broken past
And restore the reservoir of hope inside of you
And mercy for each morning that is new
