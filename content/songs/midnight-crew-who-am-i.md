o am I without you Jesus
Who am I without you Jesus
Who am I without you Jesus
Who am I without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Who am I without your grace
Coming from your throne of grace
Who am I without your love
Coming down from up above
Even when I messed my praise
In your arms I still find grace
Now I lift my hands and say
Who am I who am I who am i
Who am I without you Jesus
Who am I without you Jesus
Who am I without you Jesus
Who am I without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Looking back all the times
Hope and future plans
You feed on nothing for you Jesus
Where would I be
Thank you for your grace
Salvation beyond the rain
Thank you for your love
Receive my praise today
Oh I breathe I breathe
I breathe with what I have
I live I live
And have my feet
Yh yh
Thank you Jesus
Who am I without you Jesus
Who am I without you Jesus
Who am I without you Jesus
Who am I without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Am nothing without you Jesus
Am nothing without you
Thank you Jesus
