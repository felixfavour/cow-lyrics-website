Mmm mmm mmm...
Lalalalalala la la lala lala lala lala
There's a misconception
That temptation won't affect us
At all, at all, at all
But just like anyone else
If I let it hit my heart
I'll fall, I'll fall, I'll fall
.....
And I can't act like I don't know how
Yeah I beat myself up about it now
.....
But tomorrow just do better, better, better
Better, better, better
Keep on moving closer, closer, closer
You'll know that all is forgiven
Because He'll help you to do better
.....
See we all have fallen
But you can't stay on the ground
For long, for long, for long
'Cause after a while
You start thinking that recovery's not an option
And you're wrong, you're wrong, so wrong
.....
And you can't undo what you did now
.....
So take the clean slate that grace allows
And tomorrow just do better, better, better
Better, better, better
Keep on moving closer, closer, closed
You'll know that all is forgiven
Because He'll help you to do better
.....
I will do better
It won't hurt to be a little stronger
Long as we're together
After a while I'll notice something different
And it started
When I decided to do better
Better, better, better
......
(Tomorrow just do)
Better, better, better
(Keep on moving closer)
Closer, closer, closer
......
You'll know that all is forgiven
Because He'll help you to do
Better, better, better
(So tomorrow just do better)
Better, better, better
(And keep on moving closer)
Closer, closer, closer
Oooh yeah,
You'll know that all is forgiven
Because He'll help you to do better...
