Fate
Holds nothing on the providence I know
No longer bound to things of wood and stone
When all I had to offer was my worst
You saw my heavy heart and loved me first
Your beauty staring down my brokenness
You chose to throw Your heart into the mess
Compassion crashing down upon my debt
You were there
[Pre-Chorus:]
All this time
Like a river running through my failure
You carried me all this time
Like the splinters buried in Your shoulders
You carry me now
[Chorus:]
Hallelujah
If ever now my heart cries Hallelujah
If ever now in the wonder of Your grace
A thousand times a thousand years my soul
Will say
Grace
You saw the crushing weight my flesh deserved
You kneeled and wrote forgiveness in the dirt
And one by one the stones fell where they lay
As one by one my accusers walked away
With nothing left to throw they made a cross
And knowing only love could count the cost
You were there
