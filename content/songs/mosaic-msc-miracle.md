racle (å¥è¿¹) - Mosaic MSC
Composerï¼Mariah McManus/Brooke Odom/Andres Figueroa/Carlos Pimentel
He has walked upon the open waters
The sea was calm with just a word from him
He has fought the raging war of sorrow
When he speaks a whisper shouts within
I see a miracle in an empty grave
The one we though was dead has come to life again
I see a miracle in every chain you break
The power of heaven roaring within me
He will lift the anxious and the weary
Calling home the burdened and the lost
I am proof that you delight in second chances
I am proof of the power in the cross
I see a miracle in an empty grave
The one we though was dead has come to life again
I see a miracle in every chain you break
The power of heaven roaring within me
All for love you rose triumphant
All for love you are
All for love you came back for me
All for love all for love
All for love my name is worthy
All for love you've come
All for love your scars cried mercy
All for love all for love
Jesus Christ passion in his name
He traded all his glory for our shame
Like he rose in freedom from the ashes
We will rise from death to life again
I see a miracle in an empty grave
The one we though was dead has come to life again
I see a miracle in every chain you break
The power of heaven roaring within me
I see a miracle oh
I see a miracle oh
I see a miracle oh
The power of heaven roaring within me
