We wrestle not against flesh and blood
But we war against the powers of darkness
For we are mighty through
God by the blood of His Son
That has rendered the enemies powerless
We are pulling down every work of Satan
Pushing back every force of hell
Casting down the imaginations
That exalt themselves
We are tearing down every deed of darkness
Breaking up every evil plan
Casting out every demon spirit
By the blood of the Lamb
By the blood of the Lamb
By the blood of the Lamb
We wrestle not against flesh and blood
But we war against the powers of darkness
For we are mighty through
God by the blood of His Son
That has rendered the enemies powerless
