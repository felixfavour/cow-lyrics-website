We will not be moved
You're standing with us
We will not be moved
When everything around is shaking
You're not changing
We will not be
We will not be moved
[Interlude: BJ Putnam]
Oh, oh
We will not be moved
Where can I go that You don't know
Where would I be if not for Your love
God I receive Your grace and peace
It's not what I've done
But what You've done in me
Singing
We will not be moved
You're standing with us
We will not be moved
When everything around is shaking
You're not changing
We will not be
We will not be moved
