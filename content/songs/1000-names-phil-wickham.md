I call You Maker
You give life an eternal spark
I call You Healer
You can mend any broken heart
I call You Faithful Father
You finish everything You start
My soul was made
To respond
I know You by a thousand names
And You deserve every single one
You've given me a million ways
To be amazed at what You've done
[Post-Chorus]
And I am lost in wonder
At all You do
I know You by a thousand names
And I'll sing 'em back to You, yeah
Sing 'em back, sing 'em back to You
Your love is boundless
Beyond what I could dream
Your grace is patient
You're never giving up on me
I call You Bondage-Breaker
'Cause You're handing out the prison keys
My soul was made
To be free
