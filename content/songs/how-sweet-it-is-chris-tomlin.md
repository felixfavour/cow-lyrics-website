All the stories ever told
All the songs the world could hold
Not a single one comes close
To tell You what's inside my soul
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin]
How sweet it is, how sweet it is
How sweet it is to be loved by Jesus
How sweet it is, how sweet it is
How sweet it is to be loved by You
The measure of Your love so deep
Could fill the tide of every sea
Nothing else in history
Compares to what You've done for me
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin & Pat Barrett]
How sweet it is, how sweet it is
How sweet it is to be loved by Jesus
How sweet it is, how sweet it is
How sweet it is to be loved
[Post-Chorus: Chris Tomlin & Pat Barrett]
By You (By You, Lord)
By You, Lord (Only You, Lord)
How sweet it is (Oh-oh-oh-ohh)
How sweet it is (I've tasted and seen)
I'm loved by You (The goodness of Your love, Lord)
By You, Lord (The goodness of Your love)
How sweet it is (How sweet it is)
How sweet it is
