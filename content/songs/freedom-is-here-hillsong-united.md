The future comes alive
You speak Your Word and I
I’m running into Your hope
'Cause I’ve seen Your light
You bring my world to life
I’m coming after Your love
[Pre-Chorus]
I’m not shaken
I’m not letting go
And everything comes alive
In my life as we lift You higher
Let Your freedom arise
In our lives as we lift You up
Sing it out
Sing it out
[Hook]
Your freedom is here
So take the limits off
No matter what the cost
I’m running after Your call
And I will run this race
See You face to face
So let Your power overflow
