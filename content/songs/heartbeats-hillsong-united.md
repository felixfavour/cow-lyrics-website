Love strung out I am found in the price you paid
I know that your life is the blood running through my veins
My eyes fixed wide on the light of the cross again
I feel the weight drop in the wake of the empty grave
I want you, need you
I love you Jesus
My heart beats forever
Just to know You
Let go and throw
My future into your hands
Again
Heart beats loud to the sound of a different drum
Calling me out from the crowd to pursue the One
I want you, need you
I love you Jesus
My heart beats forever
Just to know you
Let go and throw
My future into your hands
I want you, need you
I love you Jesus
My heart beats forever
Just to know you
Let go and throw
My future into your hands
Again
