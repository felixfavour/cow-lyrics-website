Up above my head, I hear music in the air
Up above my head, there's a melody so bright
And fair I can hear when I'm all alone
Even in those times I feel all hope is gone
Up above my head, I hear joy bells ringing
Up above my head I hear angels singing
(Hook)
There must be a God somewhere
There must be a God somewhere
There must be a God somewhere
There must be a God somewhere
Up above my head, I hear music in the air
Up above my head, there's a melody so bright
And fair I can hear when I'm all alone
Even in those times I feel all hope is gone
Up above my head, I hear joy bells ringing
Up above my head I hear angels singing
(Hook)
There must be a God somewhere
There must be a God somewhere
There must be a God somewhere
There must be a God somewhere
