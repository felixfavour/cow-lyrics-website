(EeZee Conceptz)
(Chinedum mo, Chinedum mo, Chinedum mo...)
Ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh
Chinedum mo
Anywhere You lead me, I will go
'Cause You are the way, truth and the life
Jesus!
You'll never leave me nor forsake me
Except You build a house
The builders build in vain
Me I go follow You dey go
Anywhere You lead me, I go go
Jesus!
My life is for Your glory
Your glory
Chinedum mo, Chinedum mo, Chinedum mo
Taking me higher, eh eh eh
Chinedum mo, Chinedum mo, Chinedum mo
Jesus!
You never leave me nor forsake me
Chinedum o, dum o, dum o, dum o, dum o
You've taken me higher, eh eh eh
Jesus!
My life is for Your glory
Your glory
