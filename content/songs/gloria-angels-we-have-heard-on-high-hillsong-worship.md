Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in replay
Achoing their joyous strains
Gloria, Gloria
In excelsis deo
Gloria, Gloria
Praise the King of heaven
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the new born King
Glo - ria, Glo - ria
Glo - ria, Glo - ria
Glo - ria, Glo - ria
Glo - ria, in excelsis deo
