VERSE 1wooooooooo
speaking in tongues
Do you recognize the fragrance that surrounding me
I have seen my father's grace and I have dance too is melody ehhh
I bow down and I touched is feet
oh can't you see him all around me yeah
oh , the fragrance of heaven all around me heaven has come
        Verse two
I have seen what generation yearn too see have seen the master heart for me  have seen his countenance and have seen his melody
heaven is all over me
all over me yeah
     verse three (rap)
Traveling and walking in the light
by illumination of the father
am alive and moving in the rhythm of his heart
I feel resurrection in the healing of my heart and deeply in connection with is presence
it's the fragrance that am oozing by is essence
meditation of the word my revelation
so I live an external life
point of reference
in turn with the  Christ morning  noon and
 the night
like the moon be controlling the move  of the tide
I move by the sound and look in his eyes
so am asking if you do recognize when the heaven comes
In  the whisper or sound of alarm
cool of the day or a thunderstorm
fulfilling the prophecies
by the wisdom of Paraclete and strong power of messiah
he his changing all the paradigms
it is true we are dire in time
but it is even truer the he never lie
when the heaven comes in the whisper of alarm cool of the day or thunderstorm
fulfilling the prophecies
he will never leave
heaven has arrived it will never disappear
can you see him
ode o    ode o
