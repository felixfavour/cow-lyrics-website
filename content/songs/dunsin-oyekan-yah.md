Generations after Generations
Keep Praising you
Yet no Word sums you Up
Then I asked the Lord
What Name Fits You
And He said YAH
Generations after Generations
Keep Praising you
Yet no Word sums you Up
Then I asked the Lord
What Name Fits You
And He said YAH

YAH, the Hallowed One
YAH, the Holy One
YAHWEH, the King of Zion
YAH, the Hallowed One
YAH, the Holy One
YAHWEH, the King of Zion

Generations after Generations
Keep Praising you
Yet no Word sums you Up
Then I asked the Lord
What Name Fits You
And He said YAH
{ Generations after Generations
Keep Praising you
Yet no Word sums you Up
Then I asked the Lord
What Name Fits You
And He said YAH } [x2]

YAH, the Hallowed One
YAH, the Holy One
YAHWEH, the King of Zion
YAH, the Hallowed One
YAH, the Holy One
YAHWEH, the King of Zion
{ YAH, the Hallowed One
YAH, the Holy One
YAHWEH, the King of Zion
YAH, the Hallowed One
YAH, the Holy One
YAHWEH, the King of Zion } [Repeat]
