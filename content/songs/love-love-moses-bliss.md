Hey, my love
I promise to be your best friend at all times
I promise to be the best father to our children
I promise to protect you as God protects us
'Cause you are my best friend
Oh, what a day, what a day
What a dream come true
I found the woman of my life
What a gift from God (oh)
My wife, my lady
You're the best thing, you're the real one, eh
What God has join together
Let no man go put asunder
No way
Halleluyah Hossana be my song, oh
Everything I look into your eyes my wifey, oh, eh
Oh no, oh, Halleluyah Hossana be my song, oh
Every time I see you smile
Tears in my eyes 'cause you said yes to me
When I look into your eyes
What I feel, what I see is
Love, love, love, love
When I look into your eyes
What I feel, what I see is
Love, love, love, love
When I look into your eyes
What I feel, what I see is
Love, love, love, love
