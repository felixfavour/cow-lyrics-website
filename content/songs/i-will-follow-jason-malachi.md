Where you go, I'll go
Where you stay, I'll stay
When you move, I'll move
I will follow
All your ways are good
All your ways are sure
I will trust in you alone
Higher than my side
High above my life
I will trust in you alone
(Trust in you alone)
(Trust in you alone)
Where you go, I'll go
Where you stay, I'll stay
When you move, I'll move
I will follow you
Who you love, I'll love
How you serve, I'll serve
If this life I lose, I will follow you, yeah
I will follow you, yeah
Light unto the world
Light unto my life
I will live for you alone
You're the one I seek
Knowing I will find
All I need in you alone
(Need in you alone)
In you alone
