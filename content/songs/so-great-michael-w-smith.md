Young and old, rich and poor
Weak and strong, everyone
Come and rest, you are safe
In the arms of Jesus
For He is good
For he is faithful
So great, so great
And Your love endures forever
To the end of the age
Oh Your love endures forevermore
Beautiful, Majesty
Glorious, Holy One
Rugged cross, sovereign grace
Oh the blood of Jesus
For He is good
For He is faithful
So great, so great
And Your love endures forever
To the end of the age
Oh Your love endures forever
