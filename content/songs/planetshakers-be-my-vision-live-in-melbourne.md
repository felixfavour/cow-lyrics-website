Be my vision
When the waves are closing in
Keep my focus
On the peace You breathed within
And my heart will fear no more
As I turn to face You, Lord
Take this life
Let glory and majesty flood my eyes
Lord, overwhelm me till all that I want and all that I see is You
Till all that I see is You
Be my vision
When I've reached life's greatest day
Give me wisdom
That I will humble myself and pray
Teach my heart to lean on You
Lord in everything I do
Take this life
Let glory and majesty flood my eyes
Lord, overwhelm me till all that I want and all that I see is You
Step by step Jesus I'll follow You
Breath by breath Lord I will worship You
Burn in my heart till all that I see is You
Till all that I see is You
Till all that I see is You
Till all that I see is You, Jesus
I can see You now
I can see You now
Lord You are here with me
You're present in everything
So I'll lift my voice
I have resolved to serve You, Lord
Jesus be all I see
Jesus in everything
