More than my mouth can testify
More than my mind can comprehend
See I've seen the wonders of your grace
I'm so sure that this is not the end
Eze ebube
see how far you've brought
Eze ebube
I'm so glad you found me worthy
I can see
I can tell
And I know it's your grace
All my days I will sing your praise
My heart is full of gratitude
To you and no one else but you
(Thank you Jesus)
Lord I'm here only by your grace
Thank you Jesus for not giving up on me
Eze ebube
See how far you've brought me
Eze ebube
I'm so glad you found me worthy
I can see
I can tell
And I know it's your grace
All my days I will sing your praise
