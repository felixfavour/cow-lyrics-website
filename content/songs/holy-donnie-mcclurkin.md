I will lift my voice and I will sing Holy, Holy
To my Lord and Savior, my God and king
I will sing Holy, Holy
I will praise the lamb of God who sits upon the throne
I will worship Him and give the praise to Him alone
He who was and is and is to come
I will sing before His throne forever, forever
All the angels singm the bow down, and they sing Holy, Holy
We, Your sons and daughters, we praise You now
And we cry Holy, Holy
I will praise the lamb of God who sits upon the throne
I will worship Him and give the praise to Him alone
He who was and is and is to come
I will sing before His throne forever, forever
Holy, Holy
