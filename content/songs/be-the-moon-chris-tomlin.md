You're the Lord of all creation, God, You made me in Your image
And I'm just a reflection of the love that I've been given
Everybody wants to be somebody
I wanna be somebody too
If I'm gonna be known for something
I wanna be known for You
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin, Brett Young & Cassadee Pope]
I wanna be the moon, up among the stars
Fly around the world, lighting up the dark at night
I'm nothing without the Son's amazing grace
On everything I do
If You're shining on me, I'm shining right back for You
I wanna be the moon
Lord, I wanna be the moon for You
Yeah, there's gonna be some cloudy days
Sometimes it's gonna cover up the 
work You're doing in me
But still with every breath I breathe
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin & Cassadee Pope, 
Brett Young
]
I wanna be the moon (
I wanna be the moon
)
Up among the stars (
Up among the stars
)
Fly around the world (
Fly around the world
)
Lighting up the dark at night (
Lighting up the night
)
I'm nothing without the Son's amazing grace
On everything I do
If You're shining on me
I'm shining right back for You
I wanna be the moon
(
Lord, I wanna be the moon for You
)
