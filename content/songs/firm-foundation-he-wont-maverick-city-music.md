Christ is my firm foundation
The Rock on which I stand
When everything around me is shaking
I've never been more glad
That I put my faith in Jesus
'Cause He's never let me down (Yeah)
He's faithful through generations
So why would He fail now?
He won't (No, He won't, no, He won't)
He won't (He won't, He won't, He won't)
[Verse: Chandler Moore with Cody Carnes]
And I've still got joy in chaos
I've got peace that makes no sense
So I won't be going under
I'm not held by my own strength
'Cause I build my life on Jesus
Hе's never let mе down
He's faithful through every season
So why would He fail now? (Sing it out)

[Refrain: Cody Carnes, Chandler Moore & Both]

He won't
He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail
He won't
He won't
No, no, no, no, He won't fail
He won't fail (No)
He won't fail (One more time, say it)

[Chorus: Cody Carnes, Chandler Moore & Both]

Christ is my firm foundation (Testify)
The Rock on which I stand
When everything around me is shaking (I've never been more)
I've never been more glad (Sing it now)
That I put my faith in Jesus (Yeah)
'Cause He's never let me down (He's faithful)
He's faithful through generations (So why)
So why would He fail now? (I need you to shout it out)
He won't (Sing it out, say)
He won't (No He won't, no He won't)
He won't fail (No, no)
He won't fail, no, no (One more time)
He won't (Yeah-ayy-ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy)
He won't (I've never seen You fail, no)
He won't fail (No)
He won't fail

[Interlude: Chandler Moore]

I have a testimony
I have a story to sing
This is my story to sing my song
I have a testimony, you wanna see my testimony?

[Bridge: Chandler Moore, Cody Carnes & Both]

Rain came, wind blew
But my house was built on You
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through (I feel somebody's faith rising)
Rain came and wind blew
But my house was built on You (This is the reason you made it, 'cause)
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through (One more time, oh, rain came)
Oh, rain came and wind blew
But my house was built on You (This is the reason I'm standing)
Oh, I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it (I'm gonna make it)
Yeah, I'm gonna make it through ('Cause I'm standing)
'Cause I'm standing strong on You (I'm gonna make it)
Yeah, I'm gonna make it through (My house is built on)
'Cause my house is built on You (One more time y'all, say it)

[Chorus: Cody Carnes, Chandler Moore & Both]

And Christ is my firm foundation (Ayy)
The Rock on which I stand
When everything around me is shaking (Oh, woah-oh)
I've never been more glad (Sing it out)
That I put my faith in Jesus (He's never let me down)
'Cause He's never let me down (Faithful)
He's faithful through generations (Oh, yeah)
So why would He fail now?
He won't
He won't
He won't fail (Say it)
He won't fail
He won't (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
He won't (No, no, no, no, no, no)
He won't fail (Woah)
He won't fail

[Outro: Chandler Moore & Cody Carnes]
Never seen the righteous forsaken
And He won't start now
Never seen the righteous forsaken
And He won't start now
Rain came, wind blew
My house was built on You (This is how I made it)
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it through (Oh, rain came)
Rain came, wind blew (It tried to knock me out, it tried to shape me up)
But my house was built on You (But my house was built on You, oh-oh-oh)
I'm safe with You
I'm gonna make it (Yes, I'm gonna make it)
I'm gonna make it through (I'm standing strong on You)
'Cause I'm standing strong on You (I'm gonna make it through)
I'm gonna make it through ('Cause my house is built on)
'Cause my house is built on You ('Cause you're gonna make it through)
I'm gonna make it through ('Cause I'm standing strong)
'Cause I'm standing strong on You (I'm gonna make it)
I'm gonna make it through
'Cause my house is built on You
