Arrrr arrrr
Chete
You feel me up
My heart is satisfied
Oh Lord
You cover me oohhh
Your glory is all there is to see
 u00e2¦..
Yes see me oh
Catching me day by day
I agree
And so everyday
Your praise is all I sing
I bring
If all I have is only you
And all I need is all in you
You you
Then I leave for only you
And I give my heart to you in you
I will sing
For the joy of the lord has now become my strength
He is my peace and I am satisfied
He's taken the sorrow
Given me a new song to sing
Forever I will sing
Oh I will sing
