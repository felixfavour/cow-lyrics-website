I'm encouraged by Your Word
It doesn't matter
What life throws at me
I'm contented in You alone
It doesn't matter
Who turn their backs on me
When challenges stare me at the face
I square my shoulders
'Cause my God is with me
You are my strength
You are my joy
The reason why I live is You
You are my strength
You are my joy
The essence of my life is You
Everybody may give you a no
But one yes from God
Is еnough for You
Everybody may give you a no
But one yеs from God
Is enough for You
You are my strength
You are my joy
The reason why I live is You
You are my strength
You are my joy
The essence of my life is You
You are my strength
You are my joy
The reason why I live is You
You are my strength
You are my joy
The essence of my life is You
