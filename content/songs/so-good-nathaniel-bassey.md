In You, I live and move and have my being
You are my life, my joy and peace
You have been so good, You have been so kind
You are the reason I can lift my hands
My glory and the lifter of my head
I will testify for all eternity
Your goodness, Your goodness is over me
Your mercy, Your mercy, You gave to me
When you shed Your blood on the cross
Your goodness, Your goodness is over me
Your mercy, Your mercy, You gave to me
Hallelujah, You have been so good
Hallelujah, You have been so good
In You, I live and move and have my being
You are my life, my joy and peace
You have been so good, You have been so kind
You are the reason I can lift my hands
My glory and the lifter of my head
I will testify for all eternity
Your goodness, Your goodness is over me
Your mercy, Your mercy, You gave to me
When you shed Your blood on the cross
Your goodness, Your goodness is over me
Your mercy, Your mercy, You gave to me
Hallelujah, You have been so good
(You have been so kind, hallelujah)
Hallelujah, You have been so good
