You can't hurry God
You just have to wait
May not come
When you want Him
Be there right time
You can depend on God
To come through
You just have to wait
Waiting on God seems so uncomfortable
'Cause you don't know how long you gotta wait
Oh, my soul doth waiteth patiently on the Lord
Oh, because I know He shall renew their strength
He may not come
When you want Him
But He'll be there
Right on time
You can depend
God to come through
You just have to wait
You can't hurry God
You just have to wait
May not come
When you want Him
Be there right time
You can depend on God
To come through
You just have to wait
Waiting on God seems so uncomfortable
Cause you don't know how long you gotta wait
Oh, my soul doth waiteth patiently on the Lord
Oh, because I know He shall renew their strength
I'm here to tell you gotta stop complainin'
And start believin'
He's gonna come through
Right when you need Him
You can depend on God
To come through
You just have to wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
On Jesus
Wait on Him
Wait on Him
Wait on Him
You got wait on Jesus
