V1
You   surround   what   surrounds   me
You   intimidate   what   is   threatening
You   command   angel   armies
And   by   faith   I   hear   them   marching
Pre   Chorus
You   deliver   me   from   my   enemies
My   defender,   you’re   my   defender
Hope   is   here   to   stay   my   trust   is   in   your   name
Hallelujah
Chorus
You   will   deliver   me
You   make   the   impossible
Available   to   me
You   remain   unshakable
And   that’s   enough   for   me
V2
You   protect   what   is   powerless
And   you   drive   away   all   the   darkness
In   Your   name   and   by   your   promises
I   am   free,   that’s   what   Your   word   says
Bridge
Your   name   is   enough
Your   grace   is   enough
Your   love   is   enough   for   me
Your   hope   is   enough
Your   word   is   enough
Your   power   is   enough   for   me
