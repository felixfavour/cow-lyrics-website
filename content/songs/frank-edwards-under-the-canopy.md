your love has taken over me
Yes I've learnt to depend on you
I've got confidence in you
in you o Lord I put my trust
your love has taken over me,
father, i depend on you
I have confidence in you
in you o Lord I put my trust
(2)
Yes you cover me, under the canopy
Yes o, give me security
I am the righteousness of God
(2)
this is my season of increase
I am lost in your love
your mercies endureth forever
jehovah, adonai
You no dey play me kelu kelu
You no dey play me, wayo o
You too dey bless me, wellu wellu
my life no be the same
(2)
your love has taken over me

(2)
o yes you cover me, under the canopy

(2)

cause you love love love love love me
when I lay my hands in the sick,
devil run run run run run
cause you no dey play me kelu kelu
You no dey play me wayo
You too dry bless me wellu wellu
my life no be the same
(2)
your love has taken over me
father I depend on you
I have confidence in you
in you o Lord I put my trust
(2)
o yes you cover me, under the canopy
give me security
I am the rightousness of God
