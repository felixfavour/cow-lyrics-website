CHORUS(1):
How great is our God,
Sing with me
How great is our God,
and all who sing
How great, How great
Is our God
VERSE(1):
The splendor of a King,
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice,
All the earth rejoice
He wraps himself in light,
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at his voice,
And trembles at his voice
CHORUS(1):
How great is our God,
sing with me
How great is our God,
and all who sing
How great, How great
Is our God
