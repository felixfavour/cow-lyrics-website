Behold oji oku eri aja

Behold chi yiri oku dika uwe
(Behold He who is clothed with fire)
Behold oji oku eri aja

Let us come and behold
Chi yiri oku dika uwe
((He who is clothed with fire)
I worship oji oku eri aja

Your voice thunders like waters
Like the mighty waters

The Name of the Lord is a strong tower
The righteous Run into it and they are saved
We run into that Name
We run into You
For safety
For glory we run into You
For fire we run into You
Jesus we run into You

Onye m ji aha ya enwe mmeri
(The one whose Name gives victory)
We run into You
Onye m ji aha ya eje awgu

We run into You
Ejim aha gi eje awgu
(I go to battle in Your Name)
I worship chi yiri oku dika uwe
(I worship He who is clothed in fire)
