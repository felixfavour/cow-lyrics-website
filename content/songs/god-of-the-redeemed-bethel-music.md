We belong to You, Father
Love has come, we're orphans no longer
Brought into Your light and freedom
By the blood and the mercy of Jesus
[Pre-Chorus]
It's rising, it's rising, the song of hope from us set free
It's rising, it's rising, it's rising up
Hallelujah to You, God of the redeemed
Hallelujah, You've opened blinded eyes to see
We will praise You, You are the everlasting light
Hallelujah to You, God of the redeemed
We praise the God of the redeemed
Oh, we belong to You, Father
We're living for Your glory and honor
Here on Earth, just as in Heaven
We usher in, the reign of Your Kingdom
[Pre-Chorus]
It's rising, it's rising, the song of hope from us set free
It's rising, it's rising, it's rising up
