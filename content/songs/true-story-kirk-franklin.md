(True story...)
She's a small town woman
In a big time world
She's a mother and a father
To one boy three girls
She got her grandma's Bible
Next to the bills and her purse
With no more options
She drops her knees in the dirt
(She says)
[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, please help me
I'm lost, don't leave
I've tried and tried but this one thing
Now the only thing I wanna do
Is everything that tore my heart in two
I give it all to You
All I want is You
It's funny everything you thought you knew
Changes when you think your life is through
And your days are few
Now what do you do?
Everything has changed (Everything has changed)
Now I know that grace (Now I know that grace)
Is amazing! (Yes)
