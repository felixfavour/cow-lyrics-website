Sitting here
Don't know how I made it over
Wondering, wondering
Have I lost my way
Which road should I take
Is this my fate
[Pre-Chorus]
But you placed inside of me
A storm-kit that I've held on to
My own proverbial red blanket
And when it seems all hope was lost
You gave me hope
Riches unspeakable
Love that's unstoppable
More than you'll ever know
You gave me Christ
Weapons with which to fight
You taught me sacrifice
Love that will never die
And when times got hard
You taught me how to worship God
Wh–µn times got hard
You taught me how to worship God
