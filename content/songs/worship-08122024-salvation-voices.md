Take glory Father,
Take glory Son,
Take glory Holy Ghost
Now and forever more

We give you Glory Lord
As we honor You
We give You Glory Lord
As we honor You
You are wonderful
You are worthy Oh Lord

ï»¿Unto the Lord be the glory,
Great things He hath done
Unto the Lord be the glory,
Great things He hath done
Great things He hath done,
Greater things He will do
Unto the Lord be the glory,
Great things He hath done

From east to west there's no other God
From north to south there's no other God

All the glory must be to The Lord, for He is worthy of our praise...no man on earth should give
glory to himself, all the glory must be to the Lord


From my spirit
To my soul
Until my voice
Re-echoes
You are worthy of my worship
Worthy of my praise
From my spirit
To my soul
Until my voice
Re-echoes
You are worthy of my worship
Worthy of my praise


Yeshua Hamashiach,
Lion of Judah,Agu n'eche mba!
