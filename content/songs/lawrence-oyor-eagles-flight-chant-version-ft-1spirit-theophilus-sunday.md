Eagle Screech
CHANTS and TONGUES
Oh, it is time the Eagles will gather and wait For the wing....the wing
It's time the Eagles gather and wait...and wait, for a time cometh when the Eagle will soar
Ascend to the Holy hills and wait, till the wing is come
Till the Holy Ghost come, so you can soar...so you can soar
But you must wait, you must wait oo eh eh eh eh!
How long, it doesn't matter, just wait until he comes ooo eh
Eagles wait...
Cause he's coming, he's coming, he's coming
CHANTS
You are big carried on the wings of the Spirit (Eagles Fly)
Eagles Fly (Eagles Fly)
But you must first wait (Eagles Fly)
On the Hill..CHANTS (Eagles Fly)
CHANTS...(Eagles Fly)
Eagles Flight (Eagles Fly)
CHANTS
Oh Eagles Fly... Eagles Fly.
CHANTS
It's time to wait
Oh Eagle it's time to wait
You need to wait, so you can lay aside every weight, that you will be light
Here cometh the wing oh Eagle (It's time to wait)
On him you will soar...TONGUES
On him you will spread your wings and fly out
Take away the old wine skin and put on the new wine skin
TONGUES
It's time to Fly oh Eagle
It's time to Soar
CHANTS...(Eagles Fly)
Eagles fly, Eagles fly
Eagles fly, Eagles fly
Eagles fly, Eagles fly
Eagles fly, Eagles fly
Eagles Fly (Eagles Fly)
You are not weak anymore (Eagles Fly)
The strength with wings to fly is not your own (Eagles Fly)
Say Eagles Fly (Eagles Fly)
Oh Fly, oh fly, lay aside the weight(Eagles Fly)
CHANTS (Eagles Fly)
It's time to starve
It's time to wait, for your strength will not be that of humans
On your wings you will Soar
You will be transformed so you can soar on the wing of the spirit
Eagles get ready in the place of prayer and fasting
Get ready with studying the word
Get ready with Intimacy
(I will Not Stop till I fly just like you)
CHANTS
They that wait upon the Lord..
Perpetual waiting equal to perpetual renewal of strength
(I will not stop till I fly just like you)
CHANTS
Eagles fly, Eagles fly.
I hear the summoning of eagles
Come to the holy mountain where you can wait for the wing
How long you wait doesn't matter
He would surely come
And when he come oh eagle you will soar.
