The sparrow's not worried bout tomorrow
Or the troubles to come
The lily's not thinking bout the seasons
The drought or the flood
A tree that's planted by the water
Isn't fazed by the fire
So why should I be
 
Chorus
Cause You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
You hold me in Your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in Your love no matter what the future brings
You take good care of me
 
Verse 2
The sun's not worried bout the winter
Cause soon it will pass
The light's not thinking bout the darkness
Or the shadow it casts
A heart that's planted in forgiveness
Doesn't dwell in the past
So why should I be
 
Bridge
I know there must be more
But I can't get past Your kindness
I know there's got to be more
But I can't get past Your goodness
