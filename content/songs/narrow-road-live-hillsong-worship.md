We walk on this narrow road
Now restored as one we walk
In Your hope
And though
Darkness fills our path
Fear won't fix its hold on us
For we know
And love will shine before us on our path
And guide our every step within the dark
And we bear tidings of Your hope
Freedom from the sinner's plight
Through Your love
Our eyes set upon this task
Truth in hand as one we walk
We advance
And love will shine before us on our path
And guide our every step within the dark
To know You is our only cry
Knowing You our only cry
So Lord here we are with humbled hearts
To see Your will be done
Let love shape us to Your own design
To bear our Maker's sign
