[Intro: Brian Johnson]
There is power in Your name
Name that saved us all
So much power in the name, Jesus
[Interlude]
[Spoken: Jenn Johnson]
Come on, lift your voices, sing out in the Spirit
Let praise rise in this place
Lift your voices, just lift your hands
Start to sing out in the Spirit
Come on, lift your voices
Sing a new song
Ooh-ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, lift your voices
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet sound, oh
Come on, lift your sweet praise
Sweet praise
We magnify Your name, oh-yeah
Oh, we lift You up
Sing out
Come on, just let your song rise
Just praise Him from the depths of you
Praise, praise higher
Praise past it all
