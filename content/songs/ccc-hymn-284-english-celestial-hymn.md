1: Salvation come today,
To all ye Celestians,
Hear ye the sounding call,
The call of the Shepherd.

2: The call is continuous,
Waste ye no precious time,
Give cover to your soul,
Before time expire.

3: The saviour now is come,
To give us redemption,
Be sober for your sins,
That may be frightening you. 
Amen
