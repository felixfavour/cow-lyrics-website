Love that was foretold
When the prophets spoke
Of One to come
Heaven came for us
Reconciling hearts
To You our God
Heaven and earth collide
The Saviour for everyone has come
Bringing the dead to life
All for the glory of Your name
Now He comes with hope
In Salvation's robe
To lead us home
Healing in His wings
Freedom in His scars
His kingdom come
Heaven and earth collide
The Saviour for everyone has come
Bringing the dead to life
All for the glory of Your name
