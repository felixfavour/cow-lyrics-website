The storm rises from the deep
And rages around me
But I will remember
When doubt wars within my heart
The battle almost lost
I will remember
You have the last word
It is finished
You have the last word
It is finished
My fear is silenced in Your love
My hope is endless
Your voice that calmed the violent sea
Speaks courage over me
So I will remember
The words that wake the sun to rise
Are breaking through my night
I will remember
You have the last word
It is finished
You have the last word
It is finished
My fear is silenced in Your love
My hope is endless
