Are you thirsty?
Come to the waters
You with no money
Come buy and eat
Open your hands
Receive the fullness
This is bread and wine that satisfies
Abundant life that can't be priced
 for you.
Are you weary ?
Rest on his shoulders
You heavy ladened
Come lay your head
Open your ears
The Word is speaking
He says His yoke is easy
burden light
There's comfort through
the day and night
for you.
Are you guilty?
There is a Saviour
Do you feel dirty?
Oh He's full of mercy
Open your heart
He's been there waiting
There is nothing more final
than his blood
Pure display of perfect love for you.
So Come
Oh Oh Oh Come
Come receive
His perfect peace
Come receive come find relief
Oh come
Come receive
His mercy and grace
The hope you'll find
won't put you to shame
The hope you'll find
won't put you to shame
So come
Oh come.
Come receive
His perfect peace
Come receive come find relief
Oh come
Come receive
His mercy and grace
The hope you'll find
won't put you to shame
The hope you'll find
won't put you to shame
So come
Oh come
