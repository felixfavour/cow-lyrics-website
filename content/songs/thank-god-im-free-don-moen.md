I was walking down a dead-end road
Carrying such a heavy load
But You lifted me with a mighty hand
And You taught feet just how to dance
Chorus:
Thank God I'm free
Hey, I'm free to run again
Free to throw away these chains
Thank God I'm free
I'm free to live again
Never holding back again
Thank God I'm free
Thank God I'm free
Thank God I'm free
Every sorrow You replace with joy
I have every reason to rejoice
You broke the walls that held me in
Now I can shout and I can sing
(Chorus)
Bridge:
I just can't go back to where I've been
Living captive to the fear of men
I will not give up, I won't give in
I'm holding nothing back
I'm holding on to You
