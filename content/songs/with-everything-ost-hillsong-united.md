[Intro]
So let hope rise
And darkness tremble, in Your holy light
And every eye will see, Jesus, our God
Great and mighty to be praised
So let hope rise
And darkness tremble, in Your holy light
And every eye will see, Jesus, our God
Great and mighty to be praised
So let hope rise
And darkness tremble, in Your holy light
And every eye will see, Jesus, our God
Great and mighty to be praised
God of all days
Glorious in all of Your ways
Your majesty, the wonder and grace
In the light of Your name
[Pre-Chorus]
So let hope rise
And darkness tremble, in Your holy light
And every eye will see, Jesus, our God
Great and mighty to be praised
