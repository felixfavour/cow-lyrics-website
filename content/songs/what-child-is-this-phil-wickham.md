What Child is This, who laid to rest
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, This is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary, yeah
Oh-ooh, mm
So bring Him, incense, gold, and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of Kings, salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him, oh
This, This is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary
This, This is Christ, the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary
