Who is like You, Lord, in all the Earth?
Matchless love and beauty, endless worth
Nothing in this world will satisfy
Jesus, You're the cup that won't run dry
Your presence is heaven to me (to me, yeah)
Your presence is heaven to me
Treasure of my heart and of my soul
In my weakness, You are merciful
Redeemer of my past and present wrongs
You're the holder of my future days to come, hey
Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me, yeah
God, Your presence is heaven to me, yeah, yeah
Story's singing
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh Jesus, Oh Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Nothing like Your presence
All my days on Earth I will await
The moment that I see You face to face (face to face)
For nothing in this world will satisfy
Jesus, You're the cup that won't run dry
Jesus, You're the cup that won't run dry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Your presence is heaven to me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your presence is heaven to me (Your presence)
Your presence (Jesus) is heaven (is heaven) heaven to me (to me)
There's nothing like Your presence, hey
Nothing like Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me, yeah (yeah, yeah)
To me (Jesus), to me (Jesus)
Some were singing
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus (nothing like You, Jesus)
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus (oh Jesus)
Nothing like You, Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me (yeah, yeah)
Hallelujah
Jesus (Jesus)
