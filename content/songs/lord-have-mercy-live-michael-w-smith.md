[Instrumental]
Jesus, I've forgotten the words that You have spoken
Promises that burned within my heart have now grown dim
With a doubting heart I follow the paths of earthly wisdom
Forgive me for my unbelief, renew the fire again!
[Chorus: Michael W. Smith & Sarah McIntosh]
Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
I have built an altar where I worship things of men
I have taken journeys that have drawn me far from You
Now I am returning to Your mercies ever flowing
Pardon my transgressions, help me love You again!
[Chorus: Michael W. Smith & Sarah McIntosh]
Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on me
