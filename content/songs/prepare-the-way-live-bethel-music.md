We've heard the revival stories
Of ancient and old time glory
Spirit of God, come do it again
Miracle-working power
Moving in signs and wonders
Spirit of God, come do it again
[Chorus: Bethany Wohrle & Dante Bowe]
Prepare the way, He’s coming through
Ready or not, our God's on the move
We're gonna see Heaven on Earth
Come Holy Spirit, awaken Your church
God, You’re just getting started
A testimony of more to come
Spirit of God, come do it in us
We join in the faith of Heaven
And prophesy Your kingdom here on Earth
Spirit of God, come do it in us
[Chorus: Bethany Wohrle & Dante Bowe]
Prepare the way, He's coming through
Ready or not, our God's on the move
We're gonna see Heaven on Earth
Come Holy Spirit, awaken Your church
Prepare the way, He's coming through
Ready or not, our God's on the move
We're gonna see Heaven on Earth
Come Holy Spirit, awaken Your church
