Give thanks to the Lord
His love endures forever
Give praise to the Lord
Beside Him, there's no other
Give thanks to the Lord
His love endures forever
Give praise to the Lord
Beside Him, thereâ€™s no other
This is the day the Lord has made
I will rejoice and be glad in it
This is the day the Lord has made
Oh-oh, I will rejoice and be glad in it
He brought us from mourning to dancing
From glory to glory
This is the day the Lord has made
So what are we waiting for?
La-la-la-la, la-la
C'mon and praise the Lord
La-la-la-la, la-la
Hear the word of the Lord
There's freedom for the captives
Good news to the poor
And beauty for the ashes
So what are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for? Hey
