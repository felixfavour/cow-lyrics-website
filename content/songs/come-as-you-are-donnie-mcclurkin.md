Come as you are, bring every burden
Come as you are, bring all your shame
Come as you are, I know you hurting
But when you call upon His name
And surrender, surrender
You never be the same
Come as you are, hosah hosah
Come as you are, hosah hosah
Come as you are, all who are broken
Come as you are, and find His grace
Come as you are, His arms are open
Let go and let God just have His way
And surrender, surrender
And you never be the same
Come as you are, your past is over
Come as you are, break every chain
Come as you are, He holds your future
All things are new, this is the day
To surrender, to surrender ooh
Never be the same
Never be the same
