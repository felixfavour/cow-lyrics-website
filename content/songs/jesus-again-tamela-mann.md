No other name has power to heal
No other God can deliver and fill
Our hearts with compassion, grace and Your love
So immerse us again, Lord, with Your precious blood
[Pre-Chorus]
We are hungry, thirsty
We're desperate for mercy
We call on Your name once again
We want Jesus
We need Jesus
We want Jesus, Jesus again
We're desperate for You, Lord
We need You
No other name has power to heal
No other God can deliver and fill
Our hearts with compassion, grace and Your love
So immerse us again, Lord, with Your precious blood
[Pre-Chorus 2]
We are hungry, thirsty
We're desperate for mercy
Hungry, thirsty, desperate for mercy
We are hungry, thirsty, desperate for mercy
We call on Your name once again
