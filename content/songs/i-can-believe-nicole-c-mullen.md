I can do all things
Through Christ
Who strengthens me
I know that his blood
From calvary sets me free
His power through the spirit
Has given me the victory
I can do all things
I can do all things
Through Christ
She ain't got a lot
But she's gonna give it anyway
Working hard to feed her family
Day after day
Her baby's got a cold
And her daughter needs some brand new shoes
Got a job she can't afford to keep
But can't afford to lose (can't afford to lose)
But she believes that
God will work a miracle
She believes that
A rainbow can be found
She believes that a seed can make a mighty tree
Believes that, yеah the girl believеs
