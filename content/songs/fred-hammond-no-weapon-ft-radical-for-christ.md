No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't work
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't work
God will do what He say He would do
He will stand by His word
And He will come through
God will do what He say He would do
He will stand by His word
And He will come through
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't work
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't work
God will do what He said He would do
He's not a man that He should lie
He will come through
God will do what He said He would do
He will stand by His word
He will come through
Oh I won't be afraid of the arrows by day
From the hand of my enemy
I can stand my ground with the Lord on my side
For the snares they have set will not succeed
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't work
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't work
For I Know God Will do(said he would do it) What he said he would do(said he would
Do it)
He will stand by his word(stand by his word), he will come through
God will do what(said he would do it) he said he he's gonna do(said he would do it)
Stand by his word(stand by his word) NO NO NO WAY!
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't work
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't work
It won't work Dont be afriad of the arrows or the snares that... if you beielve say
You OOOO
There just aint one(there just aint one)
There just aint one(there just aint one)
No Weapon
