Oh but then Christ came
Changing everything, taking both my shame and breath away
And now every song
Every story told of Him will not compare to the moment He walked in
I never thought that I'd truly see the day
When every single chain would break
Or ever hear the voice of Heaven call my name
Then Christ came
