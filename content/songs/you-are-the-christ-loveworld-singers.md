Dear Son of God
You’re holy
You’re gracious and true

Your loving favour is endless
God’s truth You unveiled to us
Hidden for ages

From the rulers of darkness of this world
That they shouldn’t understand or perceive

The glory that was to come
Great King of Glory

Your death and resurrection
Gave birth to the new man in Christ
A new generation, a deathless race

A holy, an ageless breed
A boundless nation
A glorious people of the household of God

Who walk in the light of Your word
Partakers of Your grace
We are Your glory

You are the Christ
You’re the first born from the dead
The prince of the kings of the earth
You are the wisdom of God

The peace in our hearts
You’re the Lord of mercy and grace
Our extraordinary delight
We are radiant with joy

Great and infinite is your faithfulness
And limitless is Your mercy
Your judgments are full of wisdom
Your righteousness ever sure

Oh, Most Beautiful One
Our Lord, most high
The fulfilment of all things
You are holy Oh, most holy

You are the Christ
You’re the first born from the dead
The prince of the kings of the earth
You are the wisdom of God

The peace in our hearts
You’re the Lord of mercy and grace
Our extraordinary delight
We are radiant with joy

We proclaim Lord,
You’re great.
