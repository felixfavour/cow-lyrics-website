Come out of hiding
You're safe here with me
There's no need to cover
What I already see
You've got your reasons
But I hold your peace
You've been on lockdown
And I hold the key
'Cause I loved you before you knew it was love
And I saw it all, still I chose the cross
And you were the one that I was thinking of
When I rose from the grave
Now rid of the shackles, my victory's yours
I tore the veil for you to come close
There's no reason to stand at a distance anymore
You're not far from home
I'll be your lighthouse
When you're lost at sea
And I will illuminate everything
No need to be frightened
By intimacy
No, just throw off your fear
And come running to me, woo-ooah
'Cause I loved you before you knew it was love
And I saw it all, still I chose the cross
And you were the one that I was thinking of
When I rose from the grave
Now rid of the shackles, my victory's yours
I tore the veil for you to come close
There's no reason to stand at a distance anymore
You're not far from home
You're not far from home
Keep on coming, ayeh
And oh as you run
What hindered love
Will only become
Part of the story
And oh as you run
What hindered love
Will only become
Part of the story
And oh as you run
What hindered love
Will only become
Part of the story
And oh as you run
What hindered love
Will only become
Part of the story
Baby, you're almost home now
Please, don't quit now
You're almost all to me, yeah
Baby, you're almost home now
Please, don't quit now
You're almost all to me, yeah
Yes, you are
Now, baby, you're almost home now
Please, don't quit now
You're almost all to me, yeah
