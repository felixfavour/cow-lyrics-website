[Spontaneous]
I see the glory
The glory of the King
I see the glory
Here in Africa
'Cause I hear the people singing
I hear the people singing
And the people never stop singing
Sing oh Africa
And we're waiting here for You
With our hands lifted high in praise
And it's You we adore
Singing Alleluia
If faith can move the mountains
Let the mountains move
We come with expectation
Waiting here for you
Waiting here for you
You're the Lord of all creation
Still you know my heart
The author of salvation
You've loved me from the start
