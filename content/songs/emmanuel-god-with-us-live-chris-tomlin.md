1 Go tell it on the mountain
The one that weâ€™ve been waiting for
The king of our salvation
Born on this day our savior Christ the Lord
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere
That we can be forgiven
The weight of all our sin He came to bear
Chorus:
Emmanuel, God with us
Emmanuel, King Jesus
The Savior of the world is born
Emmanuel, God with us
Emmanuel, King Jesus
The Savior of the world is born
2 Go tell it on the mountain
Humbly in a manger lay
Mercy sent from heaven
Angels fill the sky with highest praise
Chorus:
Emmanuel, God with us
Emmanuel, King Jesus
The Savior of the world is born
Emmanuel, God with us
Emmanuel, King Jesus
The Savior of the world is born
