I'm forgiven - spoken
And I'm forgiven because You were forsaken
And I'm accepted, You were condemned
And I'm alive and well
Your Spirit is within me
Because You died and rose again
Hallelujah, Jesus - spoken
Amazing love, how can it be
That You, my King, would die for me?
Amazing love, I know it's true
Now it's my joy to honor You
Amazing love - spoken
Amazing love, how can it be
That You, my King, would die for me?
I know it's true - spoken
Amazing love, I know it's true
Now it's my joy to honor You
In all I do I honor You
Spoken:
Only the Holy Spirit and the kindness of a mighty God leads us to repentance
And I want to ask Him if He will lead us now
To places of truth, where we stop pretending
And we honestly come before the living God
That we don't drive by, but we park
And we bow down at the foot of the cross of Christ
