You saw me first
You let in when I was at worst
The moment when i heard you say my name
Is the first time in so long I'm not afriad
I'm not afriad
You are the voice that calms the storm inside me
Castle walls that stand around me
All this time my guardian was you
You are the light that shines in every tunnel
There in the past you'll be there tomorrow
All my life your love was breaking through
It's always been you
it's always been you
My Northern star
Your love will be the compass of my heart
Oh I just wanna be right where you are
Right where you are
You are the voice that calms the storm inside me
Castle walls that stand around me
All this time my guardian was you
You are the light that shines in every tunnel
There in the past you'll be there tomorrow
All my life your love was breaking through
It's always been you
it's always been you
it's always been you
it's always been you
Who was there with me in the fire
it was you
it was always you
Who pulled me out of the water
it was you
it was always you
Who carried me on their shoulders
it was you
it was always you
You are the voice that calms the storm inside me
Castle walls that stand around me
All this time my guardian was you
You are the light that shines in every tunnel
There in the past you'll be there tomorrow
All my life your love was breaking through
It's always been you
It's always been you
it's always been you
it's always been you
