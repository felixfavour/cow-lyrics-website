I didn’t know the love but I heard its story
It took me by surprise when I saw it coming
Somehow I knew the voice when I heard it calling
Don’t have it figured out but I do know one thing
[Pre-Chorus]
You can try fighting
Deny it
But it’s always gonna welcome you
Try running
Try hiding
It’ll always find a way to you
Ohh
It’s a crazy love
Ohh
Nah nah
You can’t add it up
It’s better than I could ever imagine
I could never get enough
Ohh
It’s a crazy love
Love does what it does and it wants to know you
He didn’t need a “yes” when He died to save you
That's good news
