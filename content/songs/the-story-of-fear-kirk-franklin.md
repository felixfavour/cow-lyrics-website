I can't sing, but I'm gonna work hard for you to like me
Didn't dream 'cuz if I fail then I might be
What they said I was, could I ever say I did it
Tell Ye now that I'm second to admit it
Insecure, I can't understand the application
If I applied myself I guess there'd be no situation
But who teaches who when everydays a substitute
I tried to plant love, but it never took root
My soul's got weeds and the roots are too deep
The roots don't sail 'cuz the roots are too deep
Wait
ADD, see my roots too deep
A kid too afraid to close his eyes and sleep
Can't you hear me studder everytime I speak
Fear said hello when she left me weak
Love me and left me with abandonment issues
Pains a secret, but it illuminates in you, then it creates a menu
But sin on your plate you don't know until later how much ever you ate
Now I'm watching my weight
Will this album be my best one?
But if it's not y'all on to the next one
So hello fear it's about time we speak
It may take a while cause our roots run deep
