Overwhelmed but I won't break
Through the battle I will say
Your grace will be enough
Your grace will be enough..
Under fire but we won't fall
We will never be alone
You'll always be enough
You'll always be enough..
Now in God we trust
In His name we hope
I know, God will not be shaken
God is here with us
He's already won
I know, God will not be shaken
We will follow where You go
We will trust through the unknown
I know You go before
I know You go before
Lead my heart now in Your ways
For we're carrying Your name
Your promise never fails
Your promise never fails
