Jesus,  lover of my soul...
Jesus,  I will never let you go oo...
You've taken me,  from the miry clay...
Set my feet upon the rock and now I know oo...
I love you,  I need you,
Though my world may fall I'll never let you go...
My saviour,  my closest friend,  I will worship you until the very end...  (Repeat)
