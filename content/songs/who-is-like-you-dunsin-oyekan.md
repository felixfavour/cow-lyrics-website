Who is like You oh Lord
Who is like You
Who is like You oh Lord
Who is like You
The weight of who You are
No words can carry
Who is like You oh Lord
Who is like You
You are worthy oh God
You are worthy
You are worthy oh God
You are worthy
The depths of who You are
No eyes have seen it
You are worthy oh God
You are worthy
The weight of who You are
No words can carry
Who is like You oh Lord
Who is like You
The depths of who You are
No eyes have seen it
You are worthy oh God
You are worthy
Somebody pray in the Holy Ghost
Since words cannot express who He is
Since we don’t have enough words to express who God is
Can you sing in the Holy Ghost
The weight
O tobi (You are great)
Oluwa e tobi (Lord You are great)
For You are Great
The weight of who You are
No words can carry
Who is like You oh Lord
Who is like You
The depths of who You are
No eyes have seen it
You are worthy oh God
You are worthy
The weight of who You are
No words can carry
Who is like You oh Lord
Who is like You
I will sing to the Lord
For he has triumphed gloriously
The horse and his rider
He has thrown into the sea
The Lord is my strength and song
And he has become my salvation
He is my God and I will praise him
My father’s God and I will exalt him
The Lord is a man of war
The Lord is his name
Pharaoh’s chariots and his army
He cast into the sea
His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea
The depths have covered them
They sank to the bottom like a stone
Your right hand, O Lord, has become glorious in power
Your right hand, O Lord, has dashed the enemy in pieces
And in the greatness of Your excellence
You have overthrown those who rose against You
You sent forth Your wrath
It consumed them like stubble
And with the blast of Your nostrils
The waters were gathered together
The floods stood upright like a heap
The depths congealed in the heart of the sea
The enemy said, ‘I will pursue
I will overtake, I will divide the spoil
My desire shall be satisfied on them
I will draw my sword,
My hand shall destroy them
You blew with Your wind
The sea covered them
They sank like lead in the mighty waters
Who is like You, O LORD, among the gods?
Who is like You, glorious in holiness,
Fearful in praises, doing wonders?
Who is like You, O LORD, among the gods?
Who is like You, glorious in holiness,
Fearful in praises, doing wonders?
I said, Who?
Who is like my God?
The depths of who You are
No eyes have seen it
You are worthy oh God
You are worthy
The weight of who You are
No words can carry
Who is like You oh Lord
Who is like You
There are questions we would never find answers
No words can carry the weight of who You are
