There's a light hanging over me
There's a beam running way down
Turning sorrow to ecstasy
As the dust comes to life
[Pre-Chorus]
See the shape of Your heart
Where the margins collide
There's a life hanging over me, over me
Where Your love crossed the lines
You run deep like the wildest heavens
You run deep like the wild in me
There's a love hanging over me
There's a beam running way out
In the shadow of mystery
Where my soul comes alive
[Pre-Chorus]
See the shape of Your heart
Where the margins collide
There's a life hanging over me, over me
Where Your love crossed the lines
