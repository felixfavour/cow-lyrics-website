Refrain:
I’m too oiled to fail
I’m too oiled to fall
I’m too oiled to be small
I’m too oiled to be bound
I’m too oiled to fear
I’m too oiled to faint
I’m too oiled to be caged
I’m too oiled to be stopped

He anoints me with oil
My cup runs over
He anoints you with oil
Your cup runs over

(Refrain)

The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
He has anointed me, to preach the good news
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
He has anointed me, to set the captives free
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
He has anointed me, to mend the broken hearts
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me
He has anointed me, to give beauty for ashes (Repeat)
