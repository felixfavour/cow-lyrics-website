From the earth to the sky
Let it rise, let it rise
From the dark into light
Now alive, now alive
[Pre-Chorus]
We are here to lift You up
Here to sing a song of love
Here to give You, God
What You are worthy of
A holy roar
Reaching for Heaven
Our praise poured out
With a reckless abandon
Our worship, God
Is wholly Yours
(Oh-oh-ohh, oh-ooooh)
Here we stand, here we wait
Have Your way, have Your way
Every hand in this place
God, we raise, God, we raise
