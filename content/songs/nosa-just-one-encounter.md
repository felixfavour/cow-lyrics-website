yeah
ohhhhhh
just one
if its just one encounter
just a touch from the master
enjoy life will never
remain the same after
just come to him with a purpose
put your faith and rise to the surface
he knows all your going through just a touch
your pain can fade away
and your night can turn to day
brother tis is all it takes
just one encounter
if its just one encounter
for yu to have all the answers
for the troubles on your mind to fade away
faith cometh by hearing
dont need the look that you're bearing
by faith just walk in your victory
wit just a word
your pain can fade away
and your night can turn to day
brother tis is all it takes
just one encounter
your pain can fade away
and your night can turn to day

and your night can turn to day

your pain can fade away
and your night can turn to day
