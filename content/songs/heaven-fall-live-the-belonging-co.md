The air is changing all around us
As heaven's glory makes an entrance
I feel it in my bones, I feel it on my skin
Heaven's closer than it's ever been, yeah
I feel the swell of anticipation
As we believe anything can happen, ayy
I feel it in my bones, I feel it on my skin
Heaven's closer than it's ever been
So let it rain, ayy
Oh, let it rain
Let heaven fall, let heaven fall
We want it all
Let heaven fall, let heaven fall
Your freedom, Your joy
Your mercy, and Your hope
We want it all
Let heaven fall, let heaven fall
We want it all
Every sorrow will drown in the joy of heaven
Every stronghold will break in the Healer's presence, yes, oh
I feel it in my bones, I feel it on my skin
Heaven's closer than it's ever been
So let it rain
