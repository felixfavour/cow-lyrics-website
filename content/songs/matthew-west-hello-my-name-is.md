Hello, my name is regret
I'm pretty sure we have met
Every single day of your life
I'm the whisper inside
Won't let you forget
Hello, my name is defeat
I know you recognize me
Just when you think you can win
I'll drag you right back down again
Til you've lost all belief
These are the voices,
these are the lies
And I have believed them,
for the very last time
Hello, my name is child of the one true King
I've been saved, I've been changed, I have been set free
Amazing grace is the song I sing
Hello, my name is child of the one true King
I am no longer defined
By all the wreckage behind
The one who makes all things new
Has proven it's true
Just take a look at my life
Hello, my name is child of the one true king
I've been saved, I've been changed, I have been set free
Amazing grace is the song I sing
Hello, my name is child of the one true king
What a love the Father has lavished upon us
That we should be called His children
I am a child of the one true King
What a love the Father has lavished upon us
That we should be called His children
Hello, my name is child of the one true King
I've been saved, I've been changed, I have been set free
Amazing grace is the song I sing
Hello, my name is child of the one true King
I am a child of the one true King
