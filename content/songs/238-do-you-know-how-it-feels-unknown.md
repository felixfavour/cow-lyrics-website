Do you know how it feels to know something's missing, and hear a still small voice that you just keep dismissing? Do you know how it feels to be troubled inside, to think just for you on a cross someone died?

Do you know how it feels when He knocks to surrender, have your sins washed away never to be remembered, and know that it's real, tell me, do you know how it feels?

Then how does it feel to know you're a child of the king? Your Heavenly Father owns everything. How does it feel to know you are loved by the one who created the stars up above? How does it feel to know you're alright, when you lay your head on your pillow each night, and know that it's real, ain't it good to know how it feels?

Do you know how it feels when your cold heart has melted, and tears started flowing, the moment you felt it? Do you know how it feels to know you've been changed, and it seems that the whole world has been rearranged?

Do you know how it feels wherever you roan, you still get a feeling you're not at home? Knowing Heaven is real, tell me do you know how it feels? 

Then how does it feel to know you're a child of the king? Your Heavenly Father owns everything. How does it feel to know you are loved by the one who created the stars up above? How does it feel to know you're alright, when you lay your head on your pillow each night, and know that it's real, ain't it good to know how it feels?
