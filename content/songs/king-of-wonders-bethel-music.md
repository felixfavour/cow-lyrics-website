We could try to count the stars
You already know them each by name
Every single galaxy is Your design
In majesty displayed
[Pre-Chorus]
Your glory shines before our eyes
The more we see, the more we love You
King of wonders, we stand amazed
There's no other, other than You
King of wonders, You know the way to our hearts and
The more we see, the more we love You
You reveal and we respond
You have shown there's no one like You, God
Your love and mercy welcomes us
Into the beauty of this holiness
[Pre-Chorus]
Your glory shines before our eyes
The more we see, the more we love You
