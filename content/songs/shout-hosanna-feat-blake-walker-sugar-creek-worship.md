To the King of glory and light all praises
To the only Giver of life our Maker
The gates are open wide we worship You
Come see what love has done amazing
He bought us with His blood our Savior
The cross has overcome we worship You
Shout Hosanna Jesus He saves
Shout Hosanna He rose from the grave
Come and lift Him up hosanna
Now let the lost be found forgiven
Death could not hold Him down He's risen
So let the saints cry out we worship You
We Shout Hosanna Jesus He saves
Shout Hosanna He rose from the grave
Come and lift Him up hosanna
[Bridge]
The same power that rolled the stone away
The same power alive in us today
King Jesus we call upon Your name no other name
