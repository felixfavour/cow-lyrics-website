Low in the grave he lay, Jesus my Saviour!
Waiting the coming day, Jesus my Lord!

Up from the grave he arose, he arose with a mighty triumph o'er his foes:
He arose a victor from the dark domain;
and he live forever with his saint to reign;
He arose! He arose!
Halleluyah! Christ arose!

Vainly they watch his bed-Jesus my Saviour!
Vainly the seal the dead-Jesus my Lord!

Death cannot keep His prey-Jesus my Saviour!
He tore the bars away- Jesus my Lord!
