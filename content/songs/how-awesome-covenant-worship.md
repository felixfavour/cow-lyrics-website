[Intro: Nicole Binion]
O-o God, You're all we need
In my wandering
Still Your love, pursues me
Heaven's mystery
How You gave, Your life
To set me free, and O!
God You do all things well
[Chorus: Nicole Binion]
How awesome is our God
Patient and strong
How perfect is Your love for us
How powerful Your Name
Greater than all
The One that came to save
Reigns victorious!
So miraculous
Are the works, of Your Hand
And it's so marvelous
How You know, the end from
The beginning, O!
God You do all things well
