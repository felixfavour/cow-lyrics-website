When You move, hearts awaken
Broken lives will be redeemed
Here and now, as in Heaven
Let revival be released
Hear our cry
Heal our land
Oh, God, we pray for revival
What You've done before
You can do again
Oh, God, we pray for revival
God of grace
God of salvation
We are desperate on our knees
And You can save this generation
Let revival be released
Hear our cry
Heal our land
Oh, God, we pray for revival
What You've done before
You can do again
Oh, God, we pray for revival
