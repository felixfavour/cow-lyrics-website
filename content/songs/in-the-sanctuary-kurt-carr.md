We lift our hands in the sanctuary
We lift our hands to give You the glory
We lift our hands to give You the praise
And we will praise You for the rest of our days
Yes, we will praise You for the rest of our days

Come on lift those hands in His presence
And if you love Him open up your mouth and glorify Him
Let's take it a little higher

We clap our hands in the sanctuary
We clap our hands to give you the glory
We clap our hands to give you the praise
And we will praise you for the rest of our days
Yes, we will praise you for the rest of our days

Come clap your hands all ye people
And shout unto God with a voice of triumph

We sing our song in the sanctuary
We sing our song to give You the glory
We sing our song to give You the praise
And we will praise You for the rest of our days
Yes, we will praise You for the rest of our days

Jesus, we give You the praise
Emmanuel, we lift up Your name
Heavenly Father, coming Messiah
And we will praise You for the rest of our days
Yes, we will praise You for the rest of our days

Hallelujah in the sanctuary
Hallelujah we give You the glory
Hallelujah we give You the praise
And we will praise You for the rest of our days
Yes, we will praise You for the rest of our days

Jesus, we give You the praise
Emmanuel, we lift up Your name
Heavenly Father, coming Messiah
And we will praise You for the rest of our days
Yes, we will praise You for the rest of our days

Yes, yes, Lord for the rest of our days [6x]

[3x]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah for the rest of our days

Yes, yes, Lord for the rest of our days [3x]

[3x]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah for the rest of our days

And we will praise You for the rest of our days
