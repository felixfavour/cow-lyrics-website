I will sing of Your goodness
I will sing of Your love
Though the seasons come quickly
You have always been enough
And though the night may get darker
Though the waiting seems long
You have always been faithful
To remind me of Your love

You are good
In the morning I'll sing
You are good
In the evening I'll sing
You are good
You are good to me
You have always been patient
You have always been kind
You're consistent through the ages
Oh, what a Friend of mine
So I'll remind my soul to bless You
Standing firm upon Your truth
Knowing You cannot be shaken
Cause I've seen what You can do

You are good (Oh yeah)
In the morning I'll sing
You are good
In the evening I'll sing
You are good
You are good to me, yea-eah
Sing it again
You are good
In the morning I'll sing

In the evening I'll sing
You are good
You are good to me
Ooh, You are, You are, You are

You keep on getting better
