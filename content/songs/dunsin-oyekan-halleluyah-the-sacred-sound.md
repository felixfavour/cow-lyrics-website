There is a Sound
It was Heard in Hades
Opened the Gates
And they came out of the Cave
Jesus Led them out
Abraham and the Patriarchs
With the Sound Halleluyah
There is a Sound
It was Heard in Hades
Opened the Gates
And they came out of the Cave
Jesus Led them out
Abraham and the Patriarchs
With the Sound Halleluyah
There is a Sound
It was Heard in Hades
Opened the Gates
And they came out of the Cave
Jesus Led them out
Abraham and the Patriarchs
With the Sound Halleluyah
