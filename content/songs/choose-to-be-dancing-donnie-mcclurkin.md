Another year another day
But this is the life or so they say
Another test another tear
I don't want to stay here
What you gonna do
Through the storm and through the rain
What you gonna do
When you've gotta to start again
What you gonna do
When you've gotta face the pain
Yeah 5x
What you gonna do
When your moment comes around
What you gonna do
When life seems to get you down
What you gonna do
Tell me what will you choose
I choose to be dancing
I choose to be singing
I choose to be loving
Every moment I'm living
I don't mind the crying
For life can be trying
But when its all said and done-said and done
I choose to be dancing
