I know who I am 'cause I know who You are
The cross of salvation was only the start
Now I am chosen, free and forgiven
I have a future and it's worth the living

'Cause I wasn't made to be tending a grave, I was called by name
Born and raised back to life again, I was made for more
So why would I make a bed in my shame
When a fountain of grace is running my way?
I know I am Yours, and I was made for more

I know who I am 'cause I know who You are
The cross of salvation was only the start
Now I am chosen, free and forgiven
I have a future and it's worth the living

'Cause I wasn't made to be tending a grave, I was called by name
Born and raised back to life again, I was made for more
So why would I make a bed in my shame
When a fountain of grace is running my way?
I know I am Yours, and I was made for more

Hallelujah, You called out my name, so I'll sing out Your praise
Hallelujah, You buried my past, I'm not going back
Hallelujah, You called out my name, so I'll sing out Your praise
Hallelujah, You buried my past, I'm not going back

'Cause I wasn't made to be tending a grave, I was called by name
Born and raised back to life again, I was made for more
So why would I make a bed in my shame
When a fountain of grace is running my way?
I know I am Yours, and I was made for more
(Come on, sing it out)

I wasn't made to be tending a grave, I was called by name
Born and raised back to life again, I was made for more
So why would I make a bed in my shame
When a fountain of grace is running my way?
I know I am Yours, and I was made for more
(Come on, hallelujah)

Oh, hallelujah, You called out my name, so I'll sing out Your praise
Hallelujah, You buried my past, I'm not going back
Hallelujah, You called out my name, I'll sing out Your praise
Signing hallelujah, You buried my past, I'm not going back

I wasn't made to be tending a grave, I was called by name
Born and raised back to life again, I was made for more
Come on, sing it over yourself, oh
So why would I make a bed in my shame
When a fountain of grace is running my way?
I know I am Yours, and I was made for more (yeah)
