Behold the Father's heart
The mystery He lavishes on us
As deep cries out to deep
Oh, how desperately He wants us
The things of earth stand next to Him
Like a candle to the sun
Unfailing Father
What compares to His great love
(Come on, if you know it, sing it out)
Then sings my soul (Come on)
Then sings my soul
How great Your love is
How great Your love is
Behold His holy Son (Can we just sing it?)
The Lion and the Lamb given to us
The Word became a man
That my soul should know its Saviour
Forsaken for the sake of all mankind
Salvation is in His blood
Jеsus Messiah
The righteous diеd for love (Oh, come on)
It wasn't over
For He is the risen One
