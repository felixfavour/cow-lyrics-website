Some people can be down right mean
Speak without considering
Anyone or anything but themselves
All they see is the mud on your shoes
Never ask what you're been through
Can't sing your blues
They all out of tune
Papa used to say
Troubles don't last always
So let go
And keep the faith, yeah, yeah. yeah
Cause brighter days will come
As sure as the rising sun
But if today the rain is all you're feeling
Cry babe, cry babe
It's alright
Might take, might take all night
Hold on until daylight
Keep dancin' in the rain
Dancin' thru the pain
One thing, one thing I know
One day you'll cry no more
That day will come for sure
Dancin' in the rain
Dancin' thru the pain
Life is like an old oak tree
Won't always be green
For everything there's a season
Know that there's a time for holdin' on
And a time for letting go
And when it's time you'll know, know the reason
Cry babe, cry babe
It's alright
Might take, might take all night
Hold on until daylight
Keep dancin' in the rain
Dancin' thru the pain
One thing, one thing I know
One day you'll cry no more
That day will come for sure
Danc'in the rain
Dancin' thru the pain
Rain, rain go away
In the event you decide to stay
Still gon' go outside and play
Dancin' in the rain
Ain't gon' listen to the weather man
Ain't gon' let it ruin all my plans
If I get wet I'm still gonna dance
Dancin' in the rain
Dancin' thru the pain
Cry
Sometimes you know you wanna
Cry
Sometimes you know you're gonna
Cry
I tell ya that it's alright, alright
Cry
When I think about his grace I
Cry
When I think about His Love I
Cry
But someday we'll cry no more
