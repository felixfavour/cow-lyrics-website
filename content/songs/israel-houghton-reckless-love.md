before I spoke a word u were singing over me
you've been so so good to me
before I took a breath u breathed ur life in me
you've been so so kind to me
       Oh the overwhelming, never ending     reckless love of God
        Oh it chases me down, fights till I'm found leaves the ninetynine
I couldn't earn it, I don't deserve it still u give yourself away
Oh the overwhelming, never ending reckless love of God
when I was ur for still ur love fought for me
you've been so so good to me
when I felt no worth u paid it all for me
you've been so so kind to me
Oh the overwhelming , never ending reckless love of God
 Oh it chases me down , fights till I'm found leaves the 99
I couldn't earn it I don't deserve it still u give yourself away
Oh the overwhelming, never ending reckless love of God
there's no shadow u won't light up
mountain u won't climb up coming after me
No wall u won't kick down, lie you won't tear down could coming after me
there's no shadow u won't light up
mountain u won't climb up coming after me
No wall u won't kick down, lie u won't tear down coming after me
Oh the overwhelming, never ending reckless love of God.
Oh it chases me down fights till I'm found leaves the ninetynine
I couldn't earn it , I don't deserve it still u give yourself away
Oh the overwhelming never ending reckless love of God
