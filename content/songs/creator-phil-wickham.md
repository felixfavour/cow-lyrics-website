Praise Him, all you creatures great and small
Praise Him, summer, winter, spring and fall
Howling wind, rushing streams, rolling hills and crashing seas
Lift your voice and worship your Creator
Praise Him, gleaming moon and burning sun
Praise Him, all you spinning spheres above
Shining stars, golden beams, choir made of galaxies
Lift your voice and worship your Creator
Holy, You are holy
Earth and Heaven sing forever
Holy, You are holy
All creation praise Creator
Praise Him who stepped into what He made
Paid our debt and pulled us from the grave
Every hеart here set free, еvery soul that's been redeemed
Lift your voice and worship your Creator
Holy, You are holy
Earth and Heaven sing forever
Holy, You are holy
All creation praise Creator
