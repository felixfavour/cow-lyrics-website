No one has to be afraid
For love is stronger than the grave
The hand of God has made a way
His name is Jesus
Heaven reaches out for me
Broken on a sinner’s tree
I was blind but now I see
His name is Jesus
Singing, God from God
And light from light
Your love broke through the great divide
You died and rose to testify
To the greatness of Your glory
Oh, the greatness of Your glory
On mountains high and valleys low
When suffering’s all Your servants know
We’ll share the everlasting hope
His name is Jesus
While joy and mourning have their place
And nothing here is put to waste
Death will die and love remains
His name is Jesus
