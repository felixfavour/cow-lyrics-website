Daughters of Zion, weep no more
Pack your bags, we're goin' home
Shake off your captivity
Today is the day we shall be free
[Chorus: Valley Boys]
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, Babylon
Learn the old, forgotten songs
Sing the ones you know by heart
Take down your harp from the willow tree
Reclaim the long-lost melody
And sing
[Chorus: Valley Boys]
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, Babylon
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, Babylon
[Chorus: Valley Boys, 
Chris Brown
]
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Laugh and dance like kings and queens
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Our children’s children shall be free
Bye, bye, bye, bye
Our children’s children shall be free
Bye, bye, bye, bye, Babylon
