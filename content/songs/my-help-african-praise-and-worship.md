I will lift up mine eyes to the hills
From whence cometh my help
My help cometh from the Lord
The Lord which made Heaven and Earth
He said He would not suffer thy foot
Thy foot to be moved
The Lord which keepeth thee
He will not slumber nor sleep

Oh the Lord is thy keeper
The Lord is thy shade
Upon thy right hand
Upon thy right hand
No, the sun shall not smite thee by day
Nor the moon by night
He shall preserve thy soul
Even forever more

My help
My help
My help
All of my help cometh from the Lord
