[Kirk Franklin:]
Mali, let's go get 'em!
[Mali:]
Give me that joy I can't explain
Add extra peace that'll ease my pain
I want that love that'll never change
Give me that, give me that
Give me that, give me that
Give me that power to walk away
When another god wants to take your place
Let's go
As much of you as I can take
Give me that, give me that
[Kirk Franklin:]
Anybody ready
Ready for his glory
If you're a seeker for life
Let me tell you this story
Let me tell you this story
Every place that's dark
He will bring it to light
Hypocritical hearts, back sliders, liars
Time to get right
See I include myself
I cast my own stone
I'm the man in the mirror ya'll
I can see my wrong
But I'm here by grace
Through Christ by faith
I had to make that choice
I had to open up my mouth and say
[Mali:]
Give me that joy I can't explain
Add extra peace that'll ease my pain
I want that love that'll never change
Give me that, give me that
Give me that, give me that
Give me that power to walk away
When another god wants to take your place
As much of you as I can take
Give me that, give me that
Give me that
[Kirk Franklin:]
Anybody tired
You want the show to end
Get the actors off stage
And let church begin
Do you want a revolution?
You wanna hear new songs?
God is cleaning up house
And first he's started right at home
No more miracle water
Prayer cloths for money and fame
Everybody gotta title
But do you know your name
If we humble ourselves, people
Fall on our face
And ask God everything in me that's not right take it away
[Mali:]
Give me that joy I can't explain
Add extra peace that'll ease the pain
I want that love that'll never change
Give me that, give me that
Give me that, give me that
Ooh I want the power to walk away
I see you
When another god wants to take your place
As much of you, Lord, as I can take
I see you
Give me that
One more time
Give me that
One more time
Give me that joy I can't explain
Add extra peace that'll ease the pain
I want that love that'll never change
Give me that, give me that
Give me that, give me that
Ooh give me the power to walk away
When another god wants to take your place
As much of you, Lord, as I can take
Give me that
Give me that
Come on
[Mali:]
And I choose you today
'Cause I need you today
I can't get away
See, there's no escape
See what you done to me
I'm not the same old me
You took away everything
Now you're my everything
Jesus
I choose you today
Come on
'Cause I need you today
Yes I do
I can't get away
I can't run from you
See, there's no escape
See what you done to your boy
There's no escape
See what you done to me
I'm not the same old me
I'm not the same old me
You took everything
You took away everything
And now you're my everything
Now you're my everything
Come on
[Mali:]
Give me that god who breathes life into the nostrils of man
A sovereign god who pre-destined creation before time began
I want a god who with brilliance and elegance decorated darkness with stars
The god who orchestrates the future
At the same time He knows where you are
Give me that god who supplies my needs
'Cause he owns all the cattle on the hill
And he's the god who wipes my tears
And provides enough to pay all my bills
And give me that god
That's the god I'm talking 'bout
Give me that god
Give me that god
That's the god I'm talking 'bout
How many of you want that god?
Give me that
Give me that
Let's go
Give me that
Come on
Give me that joy I can't explain
Add extra peace that'll ease my pain
Fill me up
I want that love that'll never change
I need to hear you sing
Give me that
You say
Give me that
We say
Give me that power to walk away
I need to hear you
When another god wants to take your place
I'll take it
As much of you as I can take
Do you want it?
Give me that
Give me that
Do you want it?
All of that
Give me that joy I can't explain
Add extra peace that'll ease my pain
Jesus I want more of you
I want that love that'll never change
But I know that's gotta be less of me
Give me that
I need it
