VERSE 1:
COMMAND Thy blessing from above,
O God! on all assembled here:
Behold us with a Father’s love,
While we look up with filial fear.

VERSE 2:
Command Thy blessing, Jesus, Lord!
May we Thy true disciples be;
Speak to each heart the mighty word,
Say to the weakest, ‘Follow Me.’

VERSE 3:
Command Thy blessing in this hour,
Spirit of Truth! and fill the place
With humbling and exalting power,
With quickening and confirming grace.

VERSE 4:
⁠O Thou, our Maker, Saviour, Guide,
One true eternal God confessed,
May nought in life or death divide
The saints in Thy communion blessed.

VERSE 5:
With Thee and Thine for ever found,
May all the souls who here unite,
With harps and songs Thy throne surround,
Rest in Thy love, and reign in light.
