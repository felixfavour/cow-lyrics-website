[Instrumental]
I know You're listening from the other side
So here I come, no longer will I hide
Your guns are pointed straight at me
Love always wins
I had it all but I burned it down
If we don't get lost then we don't get found
We all have violence hiding deep within
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oooh
I need to hear it time and time again
Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-oooh
It's written and it's always been
Love always wins
I cannot see You but I know You're near
No need to hide, no need to fear
You know the light's gonna find us
Love always wins
I'll show You all my sorrow, all my pain
When I'm stronger thinking all will change, and when I'm weak
I doubt it and suddenly
