Take me into Your secret place
Where I'm constantly amazed
Where the saints and angels bow before You
There's nothing like Your presence
It's just a glimpse of Heaven there
Where the elders throw their crowns before You
Holy, surrounded by holy
There's no one more holy
I'm in wonder and awe
In wonder and awe
King who is wrappеd in majesty
You alone will always be
All crеation joins with Heaven singing
Holy, surrounded by holy
There's no one more holy
I'm in wonder and awe
In wonder and awe
Holy, surrounded by holy
There's no one more holy
I'm in wonder and awe
In wonder and awe
