day in and day out I have laid out all the questions that I have inside, I have soo many questions.
( 1 verse) Time after time he has pointed my attention to his holy word, showed me the bible.
   (Hook) But how do I feel your presence? how do I know that your here with  me? how do I know that I am not alone?( not alone, not alone). You said I should not be afraid , You said I should never worry, You said that this is a test of faith( You said you said).
    ( chorus) Any day that you pray even if you are far away (I'll be there)4. Though the times may change heaven and earth may pass away( I'll be there)4. Seasons may come and go but I will never leave you alone ( I'll be there)4. Seasons may come and go but I will never leave you alone ( I'll be there)4.
   (2 verse)
  Here I am standing and I look above the mountains so I can see you( I wanna see you) all of my worries and my cares and my burdens I wanna lay it out to you( out to you) I just wanna see the evidence the signs and wonders and miracles, the shining light in the sky above ( Nana ninanana ehh) you say that I am the apple of your eyes,you say you see what am going through, you said that this is the step of faith( you said you said)
        (BTC) then back to 2 verse.
