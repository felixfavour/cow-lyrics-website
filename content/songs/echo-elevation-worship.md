When night has fallen
When fear is common
Still You're calling me
When faith is lost
And my hope exhausted
You will be my strength
[Pre-Chorus]
When my mind says I'm not good enough
God, You're enough for me
I've decided I'm not giving up
'Cause You won't give up on me
You won't give up on me
Your love is holding on
And it won't let go
I feel it breaking out like an echo
Your love is holding on
And it won't let go
I feel it breaking out like an echo
[Post-Chorus]
Echo in my so-o-o-o-oul
So-o-o-o-oul
