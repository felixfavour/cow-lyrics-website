After we had fallen
You opened up our hearts and
Spoke in truth
The bags we had to carry
They were getting heavy
But not for you
You took up our crosses
And cut all our losses
And paid for our freedom in you
We are forgiven
Covered by the blood
Of a son who was given up for us
We are your children
Adopted in a love
That could take all our mess and make us clean
The shadows now behind us
Our hope inside a promise
You never leave
So you brought us to the light,God
And told us,it's alright child rest in me
You took up our crosses
And cut all our losses
And paid for our freedom in you
We are forgiven
Covered by the blood
Of a son who was given up for us
We are your children
Adopted in a love
That could take all our mess
And make us clean
You took all our mess and make us clean
Hallelujah
We are free
We are free
Hallelujah
We are free
We are free
We are forgiven
Covered by the blood
Of a son who was given up for us
We are your children
Adopted in a love
That could take all our mess
And make us clean
Oh, you take all our mess and make us clean
