[Spontaneous: Anna Golden]
Rushing in, oh-oh
You come rushing in
When I needed You the most, You came rushing in
When I had no place to go, You came (Rushing in)
When I was ashamed, while I was still a sinner
You came (Rushing in)
When my back was against the wall, when I had no place to call home
You came (Rushing in)
You always show up on time (Yes, You always)
You always show up on time (Yes, You always)
You come (Rushing in)
[Spontaneous: Tasha Cobbs Leonard & 
Anna Golden
]
When the enemy comes in like a flood, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
You'll come (Rushing in)
When the enemy comes in like a flood
I know You'll come, You'll come, You'll come (Rushing in)
When my back is against the wall, I don't know which way to go
I know You'll comе, You'll come, You'll come (Rushing in)
When sicknеss tries to take over my body
I know You'll come, You'll come, You'll come, You'll come (Rushing in)
You come rushing with Your blood
You come rushing with Your blood
You come rushing with glory (Rushing in)
You come rushing with all of Your glory, and all of Your glory
You come rushing in (Rushing in)
Hey! Come on in, come on in, come on in, come on in (Rushing in)
We sing come on in, come on in, come on in
(
We invite You
) Come on in
(
We invite You
) Come on in
(
We invite You
) (Rushing in)
Fill this room, oh this is Your dominion
Come and fill this room
 (Rushing in)
You have all authority
You have all authority
You have all authority (Rushing in)
You are rushing in, oh-oh, oh-oh
 (You're rushing in)
Oh Lord, You always show up when we call You
Oh, You come
 (Rushing in)
