Do you feel the world is broken? (We do)
Do you feel the shadows deepen? (We do)
Do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting through? (We do)
Do you wish that you could see it all made new? (We do)
Is all creation groaning? (It is)
Is a new creation coming? (It is)
Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst? (It is)
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this? (It is)
Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory
Is He worthy of this?
He is
Yes, He is
Yes, He is
Yes, He is
Does the Father truly love us? (He does)
And does the Spirit move among us? (He does)
And does Jesus, our Messiah, hold forever those He loves? (He does)
And does God intend to dwell again with us? (He does)
And is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
He is the Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
From every people and tribe
Every nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom and priests to God
To reign with the Son
He is worthy, He is worthy
Of all blessing and honor and glory
He is worthy of this
He is, He is
He is, He is
Is He worthy, is He worthy
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy of this?
He's the lion of Judah
He's the lamb that was slain
He's worthy, he is
He is, He is
He is, He is
He is worthy, He is worthy
Of all blessing and honor and glory
Is He worthy of this?
He is, He is
He is, He is
Is He worthy, is He worthy
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
He is worthy of this
He is worthy of this
He is worthy of this

He's so worthy of more than this
He's so worthy of more than this
He's worthy of every hallelujah, he's worthy
The name of Jesus is worthy
The name of Jehova is worthy
It's worthy, it's worthy
Who else can compare?

No one more worthy, no one more deserving
He's worthy, yeah

For the Lord God Almighty reigns
Hallelujah, hallelujah
For the Lord God Almighty reigns
