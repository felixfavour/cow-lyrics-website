It's all because of You
It's all because of Your grace
That I'm still standing here right now
It's all because of You
It's all because of Your love
That I'm still standing
I could have missed my way
I could have fallen on the wayside
But You were always there to help me
I could have missed my way
I could have fallen on the wayside
But you always help me
Lord I'm amazed by how You've shown me mercy
Chineke m'oh, thank You for Your mercy

It's all because of Your love
That I'm still standing
I could have missed my way
I could have fallen on the wayside
But You're always there to help me
I could have missed my way
I could have missed it on the roadside
But you always help me

What is man that you are mindful of
What is man that you are mindful of
Chineke m'oh, thank You for Your mercy
What a great God that You are
Majestic in all Your ways
Glorious and wondrous
What did You see in mortality?
How did You think of us so fondly?
The only thing we can remember is mercy
As the blood gushed out of Your hands
They said it was a journey that You were bound to make
As we see through your profected body
And your ripped open body
All we see is mercy
What did You find in us?
How did You bring us back to You?
All we see is Your mercy
How did we find our way back to You?
All we see is Your mercy
Many times we fail
Many times we walk away
Many times we don't care about You
How do You get us back to You?
All we see is Your mercy
How do You pick nobodies
And make glorious destinies out of them?
All we see is Your mercy
We are undeserving, unworthy
And never would we we meet up with Your standard
But for Your mercy
But for Your mercy
But for Your mercy
Thank You for Your mercy
Thank You for Your mercy
We would never come near Your presence
We would never, we would never meet up to Your standard
But for Your mercy
But for Your mercy
We are called holy because of Your mercy
We are called righteous because of Your mercy
You find in us who you can use because of Your mercy
Lord, thank You
Thank You for You mercy
Lord You saw our past
You deleted it with Your mercy
You saw our failures
You deleted it with Your mercy
Thank You Lord
Thank You Lord
Thank You Lord
Thank You Lord
Thank You for mercy
Thank You for forgiveness
Thank You for mercy
You are deserving of all the praise
Thank You for mercy
Thank You for mercy
The mercy You showed the Zeraphite ancient  woman
The mercy You showed blind Bartimius
The mercy You showed the ten lepers
Thank You for mercy
Thank You for mercy
Thank You for mercy
The mercy You showed the poor boy like me
The mercy You use in rewriting my story
Thank You for mercy
Thank You for mercy
Thank You for mercy
And all we came today is to say thank You
Thank You
Thank You
You are deserving of it all
We bless You oh God
Your name be praised all because of Your mercy
Thank You Lord
