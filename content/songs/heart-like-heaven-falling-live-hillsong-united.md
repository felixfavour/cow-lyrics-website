Holy
No measure knows Your worth
Face down
Where mercy finds me first
[Pre-Chorus 1]
If You sought perfection
I'd die trying to reach it
But this broken heart is all You want
Singing holy
Heart like heaven
Singing holy
God Almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singing holy is Your Name
Jesus
How perfect is Your name
Savior
What song is worth this grace
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I'll throw my weakness
Into Your greatness
If this broken heart is all You want
