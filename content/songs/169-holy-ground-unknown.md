When I walked through the door, I sensed His presence, and I knew this was a place where love abounds. For we are the temple, Jehovah God abideth here, and we are standing in His presence on holy ground. 

We are standing on holy ground, and I know that there are angels all around. Let us praise Jesus now, we are standing in His presence on holy ground. 

In His presence there is joy beyond all measure, and at His feet peace of mind can still be found. If we have a need, I know He has the answer, reach out and claim it child you're standing on holy ground. 

We are standing on holy ground, and I know that there are angels all around. Let us praise Jesus now, we are standing in His presence on holy ground.
