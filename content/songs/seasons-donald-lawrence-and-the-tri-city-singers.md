Solo
I feel seasons everywhere
I feel blessings in the air
Those seeds that you've sown
You're gonna come into your own
Seasons, walk into your season
CHORUS
I feel seasons everywhere
I feel blessing in the air
(Those seeds that you've sown
You're gonna come into your own
Seasons)Walk into your season
I believe we're in a time when
God's gonna bless the saints
Those who have stayed
Those who have prayed
He's gonna fufill
The promise he made
For I hear the Spirit say
It's your time
The wait is over
Walk into your season
