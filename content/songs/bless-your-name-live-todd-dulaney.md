[Chorus]
Bless Your name, bless Your name
I was created for praise
From the dust of the earth to Your breath in me
I was created, to give you glory
Early in the morning, I'll seek Your face Oh God
In the middle of the day, I'll seek Your face my King
Even in the evening, I'll seek Your face my God
And for the rest of my days, I'll seek Your face my King
Bless Your name, bless Your name
I was created for praise
From the dust of the earth to Your breath in me
I was created
Bless Your name, bless Your name
I was created for praise
From the dust of the earth to Your breath in me
I was created
I was created, to give you glory
[Bridge]
