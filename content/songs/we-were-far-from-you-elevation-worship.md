Before time began
The world was never meant
To carry all our sin
Before we ran away
And lost what you had made
You planned to take our place
Pre-Chorus 1:
On the cross
You died so we could be alive
And you sought to bring us home
Chorus:
We were far from you
And nothing in this world could fill us up
But you brought us back
Before we could come
And kneel before your throne
You had to send your son
You saw us in our need
You came to make us clean
You bled to set us free
