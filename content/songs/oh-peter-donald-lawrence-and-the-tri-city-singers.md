Oh Peter, Peter don't, don't be afraid
Oh Peter, Peter don't, don't be afraid
Oh Peter
Peter don't, don't be
Be afraid, afraid;
Walk out on the water
Don't be afraid
Bridge:
There comes a time in our lives
When we experience fright
We can't help but be afraid
Just keep your eye on the light
Shining there in the night
He controls the winds and waves
(and I know if He can control the angry sea
I'm a witness, He can fix whatever's troubling me,)
Peter don't be afraid
I am Mary's baby, Peter don't, don't be afraid
I am Mary's baby, Peter don't, don't be afraid
I am Mary's baby
Peter don't, don't be
Be afraid, afraid;
Walk out on the water
Don't be afraid
Bridge
Vamp:
Walk out, don't doubt
Peter don't be afraid. ï»¿
