For the heart bruised and broken
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
For the prayer left unspoken
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
For the shame separating
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
In our fear and all our failing
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
We lift a song in the light of our need
For You are able always in all things
And in this moment we fall at Your feet
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
For our hurt (that's) held so deeply
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
For the dream (that's) lost completely
Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy
