[Intro]
We lift up tonight
A sign of our victory
And the sign of our surrenderer
High over our light
The battle rages on
As storm and tempest roar
We cannot win this fight
Inside our rebel hearts
We're layin' down our weapons now
We raise our white flag
We surrender
All to You
All for You
We raise our white flag
The war is over
Love has come
Love has won
Here on this holy ground
You made a way for peace
Laying your body down
You took our rightful place
This freedom song is marchin' on
