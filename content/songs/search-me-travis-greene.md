[Instrumental]
I haven't been perfect
But Your love is worth it
So many chances
To prove to You that I am changing
Truth is, I just keep falling
But You just keep calling, still
Don't wanna make a promise I can't keep
So, here's the key to my heart
Come search me now
[Chorus: Travis Greene, 
Travis Greene & Tasha Cobbs Leonard
]
And if You find it in my heart
Take it away
I wanna be where You are
If You find it in my heart
Take it away
Just want to please You, God
After the searching
Fix it or burn it
I don't deserve it
Your mercy kept me
Finally changing, yeah
Takes the same time to
Go back or keep moving on
Don't want to wake up who I used to bе
So, here's the kеy to my heart
Come search me now
