He's awakening the hope in me
By calling forth my destiny
He's breathing life into my soul
I will thirst for Him, and Him alone
He has come like the rain
That showers on the barren plain
So my heart and tongue confess
Jesus Christ, the hope of man
My hope is in You, God
I am steadfast, I will not be moved
I'm anchored, never shaken
All my hope is in You
He's awakening the hope in me
By calling forth my destiny
He's breathing life into my soul
And I will thirst for Him, and Him alone
He has come like the rain
That showers on the barren plain
So my heart and tongue confess
Jesus Christ, hope of man
