You have shown us Oh God what is good
You Have shown us Oh Lord what you require
You have heard all our songs
Of how we long to worship you
Yet you've told us the offering you desire
To do justly, to love mercy
To walk humbly with our God
You said to do justly, to love mercy
To walk humbly with you God
You have shown us the riches of your love
You have shown us your heart for those in need
Lord you're opening our ears to the cries of the poor
You have called us to be your hands and feet
To the oppressed and the broken
To the widow and the orphan
Let the river of your justice flow through us
