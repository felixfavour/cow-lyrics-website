I can be real with You
Say anything and not be afraid
You made me and You like what You made
You made me and You don't make mistakes
I can be real with You
You take me just as I am
You'd choose me all over again
I am the one You love
I am the one You love
I don't have to prove anything
There's room at Your table for me
I am the one You love
I am the one You love
I know You're proud of me
Even though I don't deserve it sometimes
No, I'm not a perfect child
But I still make my Father smile
I know You're proud of me
You take me just as I am
You'd choose me all over again
I am the one You love
I am the one You love
I don't have to prove anything
There's room at Your table for me
I am the one You love
I am the one You love
Your love, Your love never fails
Your love never fails
