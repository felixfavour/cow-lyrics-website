[Chorus]
I've been changed
Healed
Freed
Delivered
I've found joy, peace, grace, and favor
I've been changed (I've been changed)
In the presence of the lord, I've been
(Healed)
Freed (Freed), delivered (Delivered)
In your presence lord
(I've found joy)
(Peace)
Grace (Grace)
And favor (And favor)
And right now (Right now is the moment)
Today (Today is the day)
I've been changed (I've been changed)
I've been changed (I've been changed)
And I have waited (I have waited for this moment to come)
(And I won't let it pass me by)
So we say
I won't go back, can't go back, to the way it used to be
Before your presence came and changed me
Say I won't
