There's work to be done; there are victories to be won, there's joy for the soul, that has never been told. There's a mansion waiting me, in that land beyond the sea, and I'm gonna keep on working 'til He comes. 

Well, I'm gonna keep on working 'til He comes, 'til he comes! There's nothing in this world, worth turning around to see. My eyes are on the prize, that's awaiting me by and by. And I'm going keep on working 'til He comes.

There's messages to be preached; there are souls to be reached. There are hungry to be fed, little children to be led. There's a river flowing free, for the soul who is in need, and I'm going to keep on preaching 'til He comes. 

Well, I'm gonna keep on preaching 'til He comes, 'til he comes! There's nothing in this world, worth turning around to see. My eyes are on the prize, that's awaiting me by and by. And I'm going keep on preaching 'til He comes.

There are songs from above, that are filled with joy and love, there's a melody of peace, that makes the turmoil cease. There are gifts from above, that assure me of His love. And I'm going to keep on singing 'til He comes. 

Well, I'm gonna keep on singing 'til He comes, 'til he comes! There's nothing in this world, worth turning around to see. My eyes are on the prize, that's awaiting me by and by. And I'm going keep on singing 'til He comes.

Yes, I'm gonna keep on working, I'm gonna keep on preaching, I'm gonna keep on singing 'til He comes.
