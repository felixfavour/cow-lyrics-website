The song of the redeemed rises through the clouds
There's freedom in the blood of Jesus
Darkness trembles at His feet
Satan has no power
There's freedom in the blood of Jesus
CHORUS
There's victory in the cross
I'm breaking free
All my chains are gone
I will sing until my lungs give out
I'm gonna shout
Now that I've found victory
Oh how great a love to take my sin and shame
There's power in the blood of Jesus
This same Spirit that's in me overcame the grave
There's power in the blood of Jesus
There's power in the blood of Jesus
There's power in the blood of Jesus
BRIDGE
Sin has no hold on me
Sin has no hold on me
Sin has no hold on me
Sin has no hold on me
