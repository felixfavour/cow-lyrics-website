Just a little while just a little while to stay here yeah
Just a little while just a little while to wait to wait to wait
Just a little while, little while neighbor... when I get through im gonna be home someday.. oh oh oh when I get though im gonna be home someday
Just a little more just a little more struggle. In this low and sinful state... Just a little more few more days of trouble when I get through im gonna be home someday
Just a little more few more days of trouble when I get through im gonna be home someday
Let me tell you bout the gates of perl and the streets of gold in another world where we will never grow old
And the reason we sevent so stint fast stole, because when we get though we're gonna be home someday
And the reason we sevent so stint fast stole, because when we get though we're gonna be home someday
I can hardly wait hardly wait hardly wait, home someday
Yea oh my oh my lord yea
When we get through, gonna be home someday when we get through home someday
Many alot when then is gone on before, said is so bright and pan peace forever more. but my savior is waiting there and he the one I adore
When we get through we're gonna be home someday
When we get through we're gonna be home someday
Just a little while just a little while long
We gonna be home someday
Everybody say yes, yes! We're gonna be home someday
Yes I'm gonna be home someday
Yes I'm gonna be home someday
Yes I'm gonna be home someday
Yes I'm gonna be home someday
