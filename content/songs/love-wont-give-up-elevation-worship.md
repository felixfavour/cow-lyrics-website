Nothing I want that Your love doesn't offer
Nothing I've done that Your grace won't cover
It's not over 'til You say so
You are faithful, God, You're faithful
The cross is all the confidence I need
Your love won't give up on me
You never make a promise You don't keep
Your love won't give up on me
Calling me back to the place where I started
Lost my way but I'm not forgotten
It's not over 'til You say so
You are faithful, God, You're faithful
The cross is all the confidence I need
Your love won't give up on me
You never make a promise You don't keep
Your love won't give up on me
Your love won't give up on me
Oh, Your amazing love for me, yeah
