[Intro]
New York City, are you ready for "Wonder"? Come on!
Beautiful people, it's so good to be here
We're in for a night, this isn't even real life
How you doing, man? Thanks for being here
How you doing, brother?
How you doing? How you doing, brother?
Thanks for working tonight, you're a good man
Thank you, you guys are amazing
Thank you, sir, thanks for taking care of us
I don't know what you're ready for, but I believe that God
Is gonna be the unexpected in this place tonight
I can promise you that
Believe me, God is gonna move in this room
In Jеsus name, come on
You ready, Maddy?
Havе you ever seen the wonder (Oh)
In the glimmer of first sight?
As the eyes begin to open
And the blindness meets the light
Have you ever seen the wonder
In the air of second life?
Having come out of the waters
With the old one left behind
If you have, so say
