G God
It doesn't matter how big your storm is
I want to let you know that our God is bigger
Sing with me
I have a very big God
A very big God o
E no Dey fall my hand
He's always by my side
I have a very big God
When I call
You Dey answer me
Even if I fall
You Dey carry me
I like the way
You Dey father me
You die for me
For Calvary
Truly you're my everything
I'll follow you till infinity
This is my story
This is my song
No impossible
With my God
I no need to worry
You be my source
When I need update
You be my plug
I love you with everything
My Lord
Who no go worship you
My God
You're a very big God
I have a very big God
A very big God o
E no Dey fall my hand
He's always by my side
I have a very big God
Who no go serve this God o
Who no go praise this God
I have a very big God
Who no go worship Jesus
Who no go praise this God o
I have a very big God
You are greater than greatness
Bigger than the biggest
I have a very God
Hallelujah!
