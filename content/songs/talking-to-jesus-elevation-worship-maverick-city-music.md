Grandma used to pray out loud
By her bed every night
To me it sounded like mumblin'
Like she was out of her mind
She said, "Boy, this kind of prayin'
Is what saved my life
You oughta try it some time"And now I know she was right
[Pre-Chorus]
She was talkin' to Jesus
She was talkin' to Jesus
And she'd been talkin' to Jesus
For all of her life
Mama used to drag me to church
Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights
Khaki pants and a polo shirt
Boy, I put up a fight
She said, "Son, one day, you'll thank me
For having God in your life"And yeah, I know she was right
Yeah, my mama was right
