From first to last
You knew my days
Future and past
You saw everything
When I would fail
When I would win
When I would need
Grace to start again
Nothing surprises You
Nothing surprises You about me, Jesus
Nothing that I could do
Nothing could separate You from me
Oh, You see me
You know me!
You love me madly
Cover my life
Order my steps
I'll follow Christ?
My answer's yes
Sometimes I'll rise
And sometimes I'll fall
So glad your love is unconditional
