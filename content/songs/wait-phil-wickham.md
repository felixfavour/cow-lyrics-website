Wherever I go, I'm in Your shadow
I'm in Your presence
Up through the heavens, under the ocean
I'm in Your presence
Yeah, yeah, yeah
There is a stillness in all the madness
Here in Your presence
My heart is tethered, I want to stay here
Oh, I love Your presence
'Cause the longer I wait, the more You can do
And the deeper I fall in love with You
So I wait, wait for You
So I wait, wait for You
The battle rages, but You have promised
Nothing will harm me
You go before me, You stand behind me
Oh, I am surrounded
'Cause the longer I wait, the more You can do
And the deeper I fall in love with You
So I wait, I wait for You
So I wait, wait for You
