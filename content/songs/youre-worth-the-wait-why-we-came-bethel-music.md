Here I am waiting shadowed under Your grace
Nothing else matters but the words that You say
Here I am longing for a glimpse of Your face
The weight of Your presence is renewing our strength
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll wait for Your promise remains
And You'll come as we lift up our song
You're worth the time, You're worth the wait
You're worth it all, You're why we came
You're worth our lives, You're worth our praise
You're worth it all, You're why we came
Giver of mercy, You have opened Your hands
Pouring out goodness, You have held nothing back
Giver of blessing, You are lifting our head
Revealing the fullness of the hope that we have
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll wait for Your promise remains
That You'll come as we lift up our song
