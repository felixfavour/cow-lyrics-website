There's a song in my soul
And I feel it stirrin' in me
This I know for sure
That Your love is like a flood
And Your mercy never-endin'
I give my song to You
There's a joy in my soul
And it rises like a morning
This I know for sure
That Your grace is enough
And Your promise never breakin'
I give my song to You
[Chorus: Phil Wickham]
All of Your goodness
Is like a well running over
And oh, my soul, it sings for You
For all of Your goodness
I will love You forever
And all my songs, I sing for You
Yes, all my songs, I sing for You
There's a hope in my heart
Burnin' bright in the darkness
This I know for sure
That I will look upon Your face
Forever dwell in Your presence
And always sing to You
