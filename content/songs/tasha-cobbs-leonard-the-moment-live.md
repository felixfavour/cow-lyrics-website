Don't miss this moment
You've been waiting for a long time
Lift your hands now
Right after you wipe your eyes
You've been singing
Come by here my Lord
Open your heart now
Jesus has been knocking on the door
Out of everyone calling His name
He still makes time for you
And if you need
Need his attention
You know what do
Out of everyone calling His name
He still makes time for you
And if you need
Need his attention
You know what do
You know what to do
You know what to do
Hands go up
Praise gets loud
All that you need
It can happen right now
Hands go up
Praise gets loud
All that you need
It can happen right now
Hands go up
Praise gets loud
All that you need
It can happen right now
Hands go up
Praise gets loud
All that you need
It can happen right now
Hands go up
Praise gets loud
All that you need
It can happen right now
I'm calling Savior
I'm calling Savior
Hands go up
Praise gets loud
All that you need
It can happen right now
Hands go up
Praise gets loud
All that you need
It can happen right now
Hands go up
Praise gets loud
All that you need
It can happen right now
Hands go up
Praise gets loud
All that you need
It can happen right now
Hands go up
Praise gets loud
All that you need
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
It can happen right now
Out of everyone calling His name
He still makes time for you
He still makes time for you
He still makes time for you
And if you need
Need his attention
You know what do
