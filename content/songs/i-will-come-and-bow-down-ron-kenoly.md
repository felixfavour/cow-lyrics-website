I will come and bow down
At Your feet Lord Jesus
In Your presence
Is fullness of joy
There is nothing, there is no one
Who compares with You
I take pleasure in
Worshiping You Lord
Heaven is Your Throne
And the earth is Your footstool
Jesus I come to bow down
At Your feet
O how I love just
To worship before You
In Your presence
My joy is complete
I will come and bow down
At Your feet Lord Jesus
In Your presence
Is fullness of joy
There is nothing, there is no one
Who compares with You
I take pleasure in
Worshiping You Lord
