In the morning
I will sing you
in the noon time
I will seek your face
in the night time
I will testify
of your goodnews
you're the good news in my life
and I will sing and worship you
all my life
Kabiesio moju ba re

I will teach my children of you
they will gather around at your table
they will sing and dance and clap
they will rejoice
will sing asking your love
and we will sing and worship you
all our life

In you I find my destiny
In you have come to know all things are possible yeah!
Yes Sir! nothing can never hide from your glory
Even to you,
The darkness is light uh yeah!
And even though,
I walk yes through the valley of the shadow of death
yeah
I know yes, your spirit shall remain by my side
