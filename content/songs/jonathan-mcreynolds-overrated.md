Wear an S on my chest even when it don't match what I'm feeling
Help a friend in distress, always saving instead of healing
And I make it my job to fight bad guys and giants and villains
Well heroes have their limits
Caves get torn and don't get mended
Strong is overrated
So for once I'll just lean on you
And I'll let you do what you do, God
Strong is overrated
You show up like I wish I could
Maybe weakness is for my good
Everything that I dream there's no guarantee that I can do it
There's no word I can speak that can guarantee life, breath, or movement
Oh, but You're not like me, step in sometimes to prove that
You don't have those limits
You are God, but for us humans
Strong is overrated
So this time I'll just lean on you
And I'll let you do what You do God
Strong is overrated
You show up like I wish I could
Maybe weakness is for my good
I may have to cry just a little bit
I may have to lay here a little while longer
I may have to pray through the thick of it
But when I get weak Lord, You get stronger
Strong is overrated
So this time I'll just lean on you
And I'll let you do what you do God
Strong is overrated
You show up like I wish I could
Show up like I wish I could
Maybe weakness is for my good
You show up like I wish I could
Show up like I wish I could
Maybe weakness is for my good
You show up like I wish I could
Show up like I wish I could
Maybe weakness is for my good
