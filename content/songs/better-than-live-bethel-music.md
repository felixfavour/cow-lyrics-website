It's gonna be better than, better than
Better than I could dream
It's gonna be better than, better than
Better than I could dream
It's gonna be better than, better than
Better than I could dream

Better than I could dream
Your goodness can't be stopped
Your love is better than I ever thought
Your mercy saved my soul
Your kindness came down to make me whole
[Pre-Chorus: Jonathan David Helser]
I prophesy into tomorrow
We will see the goodness of our God
[Chorus: Jonathan David Helser & Melissa Helser]
It's gonna be better than, better than

It's gonna be better than, better than
Better than I could dream
It's gonna be better than, better than
Better than I could dream
It's gonna be better than, better than
Better than I could dream
