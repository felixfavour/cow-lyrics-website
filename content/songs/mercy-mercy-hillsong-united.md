Mercy, mercy, bring me to my knees
As the morning calls to light the dark in me
Heaven's story, breathing life into my bones
Spirit lift me from this wasteland, lead me home
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I find my life in Yours
My eyes on Your name
Arrest my heart from its reckless path
Release the chains in me
Awake my soul to the hope You hold
Your grace is all I need
Humble glory, chose to carry all my shame
Rendered worthy in the shadow of Your name
Gracious fury, written in my Saviour's scars
Mercy, mercy, now engraved upon my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I find my life in Yours
My eyes on Your name
