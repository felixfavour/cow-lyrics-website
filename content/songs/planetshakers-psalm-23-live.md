The Lord is my shepherd
And all I need
Through every season
Your love will lead
You're my provider
And victory
You are the strength of my life
And I will praise, on the mountain
I will praise, in the valley
I will not fear
I will not fear
For You are here with me
You are preparing
A table for me
Right in the presence
Of my enemies
Goodness and mercy
Will follow me
All of the days of my life
And I will praise, on the mountain
I will praise in the valley
I will not fear
I will not fear
For You are here with me
And I will praise, on the mountain
I will praise, in the valley
I will not fear
I will not fear
For You are here with me
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh

God You're so good to me
Oh, come on church
Praise him!
I will praise, on the mountain
I will praise, in the valley
I will not fear
I will not fear
For You are here with me
I will praise, on the mountain
I will praise, in the valley
I will not fear
I will not fear
For You are here with me
My cup overflows

Come on lift your hands to the Lord
It's His oil of anointing
He's pouring it out
From the top of your head
To the soles of your feet
Would you receive that
Receive His touch
Receive His healing
Receive His Power
His energy, His efficiency
Oh, we receive it Lord
Restore, refresh bodies in this room God
Refresh immune systems
Come on Lord, we receive Your healing touch
Your healing power
Oh, thank you Lord!
Yes Lord!
Come, Living Water
Come, Living Water
Come, Like a flood
Break through the dry place
Come Living Water
Come Living Water
Come like a flood
Break through the dry place
Come like rain
Living water
Refreshes the earth
All dry things disappear
Heaven's Life Giving Water
Living Life Giving Water
You flow from the throne of God
Oh, Living Water
Living Water
Yes we receive!
Come to us Lord
His Living Water
We receive from You, Lord
We receive from You, God
