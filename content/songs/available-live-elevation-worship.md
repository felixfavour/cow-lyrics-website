Narrow as the road may seem
I'll follow where Your Spirit leads
Broken as my life may be
I will give You every piece
I hear You call
I am available
I say, "Yes, Lord"I am available
Here I am with open hands
Counting on Your grace again
Less of me and more of You
I just wanna see You move
I hear You call
I am available
I say, "Yes, Lord"I am available
And I hear You call
I am available
I say, "Yes, Lord"I am available (Oh-ooh-ooh, woah-oh)
