All of creation, all of the earth
Make straight a highway, a path for the Lord
Jesus is coming soon
Call back the sinner, wake up the saint
Let every nation, shout of Your fame
Jesus is coming soon
Like a bride waiting for her groom
We'll be a Church ready for You
Every heart longing for our King we sing Even so come, Lord Jesus come
Even so come, Lord Jesus come
There will be justice, all will be new
Your name forever, faithful and true
Jesus is coming soon, yeah-eh...
Like a bride waiting for her groom
We'll be at Church ready for You
Every heart longing for our King we sing Even so come, Lord Jesus come
Even so come, Lord Jesus come
