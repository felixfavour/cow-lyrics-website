[Intro]
You are the first and the last
That's why we call you Alpha, Omega
You own the world, you fill the universe
You made the things we see and cannot see
Your love is great, your mercy sure
Your grace has done more than I could have done
When I was bound, you came and rescued me
You gave me light and took the darkness
You are the first and the last
That's why we call you Alpha, Omega
You own the world, you fill the universe
You made the things we see and cannot see
Your love is great, your mercy sure
Your grace has done more than I could have done
When I was bound, you came and rescued me
You gave me light and took my darkness
You surround me with many victories
Jehovah Nissi, you're my banner
You go before me, you fight my battles
Jehovah Nissi
Jehovah Nissi
