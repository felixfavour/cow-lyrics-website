speaking tongues
c'mon raise it to him
raise it to him
your words of worship
you sounds of worship
straight from your heart, to your father's ears
he knows your voice
he knows when you sing
he knows when you speak
he wants to hear you beckon on him
he wants to hear you speak to him
c'mon wherever you are, let him know you have come with gratitude tonight let him know that you have come like that one
that came to say thank you
