Calvary, the Cross that Christ carried
By His death now I live
Forevermore

Baptism, I was immersed in Him
My sins were washed in Him
Now I am clean

Oh, You paid the price for all my sins
And took away my guilt and shame
And now I am the righteousness of GOD
Oh, You paid the price for all my sins
And took away my guilt and shame
And now I am the righteousness of GOD

Oh oh, what a privilege I have in you

Gethsemane, the place you gave up your will
My sickness that you may heal
And make me whole

The weight of sin, you bore with tears and cries
My life now found in Christ
The sacrifice

Oh, You paid the price for all my sins
And took away my guilt and shame
And now I am the righteousness of GOD
Oh, You paid the price for all my sins
And took away my guilt and shame
And now I am the righteousness of GOD

Oh oh, what a privilege I have in you

Golgotha, they called the place of skull
Wine they mingled with gall
He would not drink

His clothes were torn, He faced their mock and scorn

His suffering

Praise the LORD, He lives forevermore
Death could not hold Him down
Settled the score

Oh, You paid the price for all my sins
And took away my guilt and shame
And now I am the righteousness of GOD
Oh, You paid the price for all my sins
And took away my guilt and shame
And now I am the righteousness of GOD

Oh oh, what a privilege I have in you
