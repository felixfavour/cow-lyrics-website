Lift up your eyes, child
Don't be afraid
I hold the world in the palm of My hand
Lift up your eyes, child
I'm calling your name
My love for you is greater than the grains of sand
I will be with you
There's nothing to fear
Wherever you go
I will be there
When all you see is arrows
I'll be your shield
I will be with you
There's nothing to fear
Come, come away, child
I'll keep you safe
I'll cover you with peace like a riverbed
If you feel like you're sinking
Sink into My grace
Come find yoursеlf in the love that will nevеr end
Oh, I will be with you
There's nothing to fear
Wherever you go
I will be there
When all you see is arrows
I'll be your shield
I will be with you
There's nothing to fear
