Come on in and take Your seat
This is where I wanna be
Your presence here is everything Jesus
You have always been enough
Captivated by Your love
I’ll stay here in the presence of Jesus
Now You’re in the room
There’s nothing left to do
All I wanna do is worship
All I wanna do is worship
Been waiting here for You
And I’m not gonna move
All I wanna do is worship
All I wanna do is worship
So speak
Jesus speak to me
Speak
Jesus speak I’m listening
I’ll stay here forever
I’ll stay here forever
I’ll stay here forever
I’ll stay here forever
