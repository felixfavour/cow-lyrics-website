Ohhhh ohhh ohhh
Ehn ehn
Oh my God
Yea yea yeah
I was undeserving when this love
It came my way
You wrapped your arms around me
Made me unashamed
And all I know is I will never be the same
Because of you
I'm in love with you (You're my Daddy)
I'm in love with You (You're my Daddy)
Fell in love every single part of You (You're my Daddy)
I'm not ashamed to say (You're my Daddy)
I'm in love with you (You're my Daddy)
I'm in love with You (You're my Daddy)
Fell in love every single part of You (You're my Daddy)
I'm not afraid to say (You're my Daddy)
You told me I'm with yo-yo-yo, yo-yo-yo
Never leave you no-no-no
You told me I'm with yo-yo-yo, yo-yo-yo
Never leave you no-no-no
How You leave the ninety nine for me
What a sacrifice you made for me
Every night I'm hearing you calling
Everytime I hear you I'm drawn in
Dry my eyes whenever I'm mourning
Shine the light like I'm in the morning
You're the one that keeps me from falling
Oh my world e sweet me like honey
I'm in love with you (You're my Daddy)
I'm in love with You (You're my Daddy)
I'm in love with every single part of You (You're my Daddy)
I'm not ashamed to say (You're my Daddy)
I'm in love with you (You're my Daddy)
I'm in love with You (You're my Daddy)
I'm in love with every single part of You (You're my Daddy)
I'm not afraid to (You're my Daddy)
You told me I'm with yo-yo-yo, yo-yo-yo
Never leave you no-no-no
Oh my Daddy You are (yo-yo-yo)
You're with me always (yo-yo-yo)
Never leave you no-no-no
Ibanuje Jina s'ile mi (Jina s'ile mi)
Jina s'ile jina s'ile mi jina s'ile mi (jina s'ile mi jina s'ile mi)
Ibanuje jina s'ile mi (Jina s'ile mi)
Jina s'ile jina s'ile mi jina s'ile mi (jina s'ile mi jina s'ile mi)
