When I am found upon my knees
And all want is you to be with me
I know you show yourself so true
My hope is found in you
When I walk through the valleys though
If I am weary of the narrow road
I know you show yourself so strong
I know you're faithful
All my days I will trust
I will trust in you
And Though my heart and flesh may fail
Jesus I will trust in you
When I am found upon my knees
And all I want is you to meet with me
I know you show yourself so true
My hope is found in you
All my days I will trust
I will trust in you
And Though my heart and flesh may fail
Jesus I will trust in you
Hallelujah my soul will sing your praise
