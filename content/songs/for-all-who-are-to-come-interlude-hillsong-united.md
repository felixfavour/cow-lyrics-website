Since we are surrounded
By such a great cloud of witnesses
Let us run
Let us run with perseverance
The race marked out
Let us make a way
For those who are to come
Those who are to come
Every generation
Every nation
Every tribe
Every tongue
They will sing
They will cry
Oh with one voice
They will sing
Hosanna
