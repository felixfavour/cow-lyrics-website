e if I tell you say
Na you I dey think of when you call
If I tell you say
I no forget you at all at all
You no go believe
Wetin I dey talk
Cause everyday if I remember you, smile dey come my face
Day by day, January to December
You dey for my prayers
So make you believe me
Wetin I dey talk
Cause you are always on my mind
Always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Yes you are
You are always on my mind
If I tell you say
I dey with you through your ups and downs
If I tell you say
I dey with you even if I'm not around
Shey you go believe
Wetin I dey talk
Cause in this our case
Out of sight no be out of mind
And by God's grace
One day we go dey together just like old times
Shey you dey feel everything I talk
And you are always on my mind
No forget you are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Yes you are
Always on my mind
You are always on my mind.yes you are, yes you are
Always on my mind
I no forget you at all at all
always on my mind
Before you go away
There is one more thing I must tell you
Shey you tell me say
Na the love of God dey compel you
And me I believe
Wetin you talk
So just in case
Whatever you do make you no forget
If I seem to fail
Don't you blame my heart
Blame my head
Hope say you feel
Wetin I dey talk
But you are always on my mind
Always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You no comot
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Yes you are
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Always on my mind
