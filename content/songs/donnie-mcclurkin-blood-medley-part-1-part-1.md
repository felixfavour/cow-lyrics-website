When I want to feel the presence of the Lord, I go to the songs that have power.
Songs that deal with the cross.
Because we can't get so advanced that we forget the Cross of Calvary
(I don't hear you in here).
We can't become so progressive that we forget it's the Cross that saves.
It's the Cross that purchased our salvation.
It was His death on the cross that made it so that we can have a right to salvation and eternity.
It was the death, it was the bloody, glory, wonderful cross.
(Then we sing)
At last indeed my Savior bleed
And did my Sov'reign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?
(Tongues)
Was it for crimes that I had done, He hung upon the tree? What amazing pity! Grace unknown! And love beyond degree?
(See, lot of people don't know those verses)
Drops and grief cann'er repay, the debt of love I owe. Dear Lord I give myself to Thee, it's all that I can do.
(And then we sing)
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
And the burdens of my heart rolled away.
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
See, the generations have got to know these songs. The children have got to hear the same songs that I heard. You got to hear the whole people say.
Down at the cross where my saviour died. Down where the cleansing from sin I cried. There to my heart was the blood applied. As we singing Glory to His name!
 (See, you young people don't know these songs)
I am so wonderously saved from my sins. Jesus so sweetly abounds made it. There at the cross where He took me in. As we singing Glory to His name!
Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin. I am so glad that I entered in. It was there that Jesus saved me and keeps me clean. As we singing Glory to His name!
(And for those of you that are not saved in the room)
Come to this fountain so rich and sweet. Cast down poor souls at the saviour's feet. If you punch in today you'll be made complete. You'll be singing Glory to His name!
(Oh, singing!)
Glory to His name, precious name. (Singing)
Glory to His name. Oh, there to my heart was the blood applied.
(Everybody join in and say)
Glory to His name!
