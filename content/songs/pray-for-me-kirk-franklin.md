Pray for me, I'm afraid that I'm about to lose it all
Pray for me, I don't need gravity for tears to fall
You can keep your fancy words and your colored lies
Nothing super-spiritual not this time
Just pray for me
Cause judging me is not helping me to grow
Pray for me
See the wrong I've done I already know
Will you love me if I'm dirty and I've lost my way
Till the blood is washed me white and I'm no longer gray
If I don't need your approval will you let me stay
And pray for me
Pray for me (x3)
Pray for me
Please pray for me
Let's pray!
Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it in heaven
Give us our daily bread, and forgive us
Our trespasses
As we forgive those who have trespassed against us (c'mon)
Lord lead us not into temptation
But deliver us
From evil for thine is thy kingdom (yes), power and the glory forever (c'mon)
We are asking (We are asking you to)
