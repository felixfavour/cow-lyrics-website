When You love, You love with no limits
When You love, You love with no boundaries
When You love, You love without ending
No one else can love the way You do
(Say when You love) When You love (Ayy), You love with no limits
(When You love) When You love, You love with no boundaries
(When You love) When You love, You love without ending
(No one else) No one else can love the way You do
(Sing an endless love)
An endless love, like waterfalls
And it's crashing down on me
(Sing relentless love)
Relentless love, like waterfalls
And it's crashing down on me
(Can you feel it?)
(When You love) When You love (Ayy), You love with no limits
(Say when You love) When You love, You love with no boundaries
(Say when You love) When You love, (Say) You love without ending
(Say no one else) No one else can love the way You do
(Come on, let's raise it)
(No one else) No one else can love the way You do
