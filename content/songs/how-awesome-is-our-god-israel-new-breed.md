[Instrumental]
[Chorus: Israel Houghton & Yolanda Adams]
So amazing, so amazing
Your love for us is overwhelming
How awesome is our God
So amazing, so amazing
Your love for us is overwhelming
How awesome is our God
[Interlude: Israel Houghton & Yolanda Adams]
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh (It's overwhelming, oh God)
Oh oh-oh-oh
You love me, You love me
And no boundary can come between us
You have me, You have me
And no power can separate us
[Pre-Chorus: Israel Houghton & Yolanda Adams]
Oh, my soul cries out
Oh, my soul cries out
Oh, my soul cries out
Hallelujah, hallelujah
