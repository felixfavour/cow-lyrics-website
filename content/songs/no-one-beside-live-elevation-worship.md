Within my heart
Is a melody that was not taught
In the darkest night, it still goes on
The anthem of my God
Within my heart
Is a treasure that cannot be bought
When all else is faded, it will not
The presence of my God
Oh magnify the Lord
Let us exalt His name together
No one beside You, Lord
Honor and praise are Yours forever
Before Your throne
In the mystery that can't be known
Lives the majesty that's Yours alone
How glorious You are
You are the one
Who redeems the wrongs that I have done
Reigning over all the days to come
How glorious You are
