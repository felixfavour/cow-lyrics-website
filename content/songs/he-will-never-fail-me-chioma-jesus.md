He can never never fail
He can never never fail
Eh he can never never fail
Ojuchukwu ji iyele

Maka gi nile
He can never ever fail me
Ebube dike, he can never never fail

Since i believe him

Jehovah jireh
He can never never fail
He can never never change

Ancient of days
Baba God will never never change
Ebube he's not a man
He is not your wife
You husband, he will fail you
Even your best friend they will deny you
Even your mother will reject you some day
When it is good oh you will have many friends
When the going becomes bad, all of them will run
But Jehovah jire he will never never fail you
In every season he will never ever fail
In the morning he can never never fail
Call him every time He can never never fail
When you need him, he's always there for you
In the lions den he never never failed Daniel
He can never never fail you
I am that I am he will never ever disappoint you
In the time of sorrow he will never never lie
Call him in the night
He will never never fail you
Obugimmadu mmadu uwa nelu anya ani oh
Obugi onyeuwa and enyi adimmma ha biawa
Iyesiwere dikeh ha nile ha gbaoso eh
Ezemo he will never ever fail you
I am that I am he can never never fail me
Nwanne otu onye
He can never never fail
You are the mother of the motherless
He can never never fail
You are the father of the fatherless
He can never never fail
Voice of the voiceless
He can never never fail
Hope of the hopeless
He can never never fail
You are the help of the helpless
He can never never fail
You are the leader of the word
He can never never fail
Jehovah jire
He can never never fail
He never never fails
He can never never fail
Ogbaku wo gbehin
Ebekwe dikele
Okpuru onye na magi ekwu okwu
Ojiji jide mama eh
Okwa gi n'chetu onye echefueche
He can never, he can never
Onye nezine biko faniya bulie ogbe nelu
Your brothers will fail you
But Jehovah will never fail you
He no dey do 419
He no go wayo you
He no go dupe you
Because he never never fails
He's word is yes *
Just believe him he will never never tell lies
He will bring it to past
Cus he will never never fail
He that sits upon the throne
Can never never fail
He can never never fail
He has never never failed
When I was suffering all men rejected me
Everybody around me abandoned me
I look up to you
Jehovah you did not fail me
Men they promise you by 12, by 11
They would disappoint you
But baba God never never fails
Look up to him
He will never never fail
Onye ne buniye enu
He can never never fail
Odumi ije ma
He will never never fail you
Rejoice not over me oh my enemies
For downfall of a man is not the end of his life
If I fall seven times the Lord will lift me up again
Because he will never never fail
Daddy ah he will never never fail
He never fedana he can never ever fail
Uche ochosi
He can never never fail
Jehovah alpha
He can never never fail
He will  uzo
He can never never fail
Where there is no way
He can never never fail
He knows your yearns
He can never never fail
He holds your peace
He can never never fail
He will never never fail
He can never never fail
Call upon him he will answer you
He can never never fail
He never never never never fails
He can never never fail
Jehovah jire never never fails
He can never never fail
