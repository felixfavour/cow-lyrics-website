[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
So many different religions and
So many different churches and
If God really loves me
Then why does life keep hurting me?
Have you ever asked any of these questions?
Well my friend I've got the answer
Just listen
You have the power
To make the seasons change
The river flows for you
The wind whispers Your name
For me you left Your throne
And traded crown for thorns instead
I'm safe within not by Your skin
But because Your blood was red
Some say You're black, you're white
They question if you're real
We treat you like we treat ourselves
I wonder how you feel
To see your children fight in spite
Of the tears for us you've shed
Doesn't matter what color you are
As long as your blood was red
