We bow our hearts, we bend our knees
Oh Spirit come make us humble
We turn our eyes from evil things
Oh Lord we cast down our idols
So give us clean hands and give us pure
Hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Oh give us clean hands and give us pure
Hearts
Let us not lift our souls to another
Oh God let this be a generation that seeks
Who seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob
Oh God let us be a generation that seeks
Who seeks Your face, oh God of Jacob
