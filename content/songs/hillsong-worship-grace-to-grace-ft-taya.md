love endured that ancient cross
How precious is my Savior's blood
The beauty of heaven wrapped in my shame
The image of love upon death's frame
If having my heart was worth the pain
What joy could You see beyond the grave
If love found my soul worth dying for
How wonderful, how glorious
My Savior's scars victorious
My chains are gone, my debt is paid
From death to life and grace to grace
If heaven now owns that vacant tomb
How great is the hope that lives in You
The passion that tore through hell like a rose
The promise that rolled back death and its stone
If freedom is worth the life You raised
Oh where is my sin, where is my shame?
If love paid it all to have my heart
How wonderful, how glorious
My Savior's scars victorious
My chains are gone, my debt is paid
From death to life and grace to grace
When I see that cross, I see freedom
When I see that grave, I'll see Jesus
And from death to life, I will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace
When I see that cross, I see freedom
When I see that grave, I'll see Jesus
And from death to life, I will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace
When I see that cross, I see freedom
When I see that grave, I'll see Jesus
And from death to life, I will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace
How my soul will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace
How my soul will sing Your praise
How wonderful, how glorious
My Savior's scars victorious
My chains are gone, my debt is paid
From death to life and grace to grace
When I see that cross, I see freedom
When I see that grave, I'll see Jesus
And from death to life, I will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace
When I see that cross, I see freedom
When I see that grave, I'll see Jesus
And from death to life, I will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace
How my soul will sing Your praise
In the wonder of Your grace
How my soul will sing Your praise
How wonderful, how glorious
My Savior's scars victorious
My chains are gone, my debt is paid
From death to life and grace to grace
