Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me!
There is a Name I love to hear
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in my ear
The sweetest Name on earth
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me!
It tells me of a Savior's love
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood
The sinner's perfect plea
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me!
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Oh, how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me!
