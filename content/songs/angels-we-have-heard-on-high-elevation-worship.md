Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ Whose birth the angels sing
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King
We sing gloria, we sing gloria
We sing gloria, we sing gloria
In excelsis deo
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
We sing gloria, we sing gloria
We sing gloria, we sing gloria
In excelsis deo
We sing gloria, we sing gloria
We sing gloria, we sing gloria
In excelsis deo
