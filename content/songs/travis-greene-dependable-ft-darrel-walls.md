Thank You for Saving me
Thank You for Loving me
Too much to Leave
You're not just the God who Saves
But You are the One
That Remains the same
Every high and low You'll stay always
I can Count on You

Your Love is not Temporary
Up and down, in and out
When it Starts, it won't Stop
Your Love will keep going
On and on and on
You are Dependable, God

Thank You for Saving me
Thank You for Loving me
Too much to Leave
You're not just the God who Saves
But You are the One
That Remains the same
Every high and low You'll stay always
I can Count on You

Your Love is not Temporary
Up and down, in and out
When it Starts, it won't Stop
Your Love will keep going
On and on and on
You are Dependable, God

Thank You for Saving me
Thank You for Loving me
Too much to Leave
You're not just the God who Saves
But You are the One
That Remains the same
Every high and low You'll stay always
I can Count on You
Always,
I can Count on You
Always,
I can Count on You
