Some people place their whole existence
On the car they drive, or the clothes they've worn
And we get all proud to rep our city, CHI Town
And even the month that they were born - September
See everybody loves, their different story.
Everyone on earth has a different cause
But before the details get too gory
There's one thing that unifies us all
We are Christ representers!
We are Christ representers!
And we shine our light so bright that we make them say Whoa
We gotta let them know that we are Christ Representers
I've been anointed to be the light
And glorify my God
So every box you try to put me in
It may be exactly what I'm not
We're not your average boys and girls
There's something very special on our ID
What I'm worth to the world
It's way bigger than me
Cuz we are, Christ Representers!
We are Christ representers!
And we shine our light so bright that we make 'em say Whoa
We gotta let them know that we are Christ Representers!
We are Christ Representers!
We are Christ representers!
And we shine our light so bright that we make 'em say Whoa
We gotta let them know that we are Christ Representers!
We're the light of the world, we're a city on a hill
And we're telling everybody that Jesus is real
And we go by the name that's the greatest in the land
Whoa, everybody don't understand, that's cool, but -
We are Christ Representers!
We are Christ representers!
And we shine our light so bright that we make 'em say Whoa
We gotta let them know that we are Christ Representers!
We are Christ representers!
We are Christ representers!
And we shine our light so bright that we make them say
Whoa
We gotta let them know that we are Christ representers
Let the Redeemed of the Lord say so, say so, live so, walk so
We shine our light so bright that we make 'em say Whoooooooaaaaaaa uuuuuuhhhhhh we are, we are, we are whoooooaaaah...
