All my life I've been carried by grace
Don't ask me how 'cause I can't explain
It's nothing short of a miracle I'm here
I've got some blessings that I don't deserve
I've got some scars but that's how you learn
It's nothing short of a miracle I'm here
I think it over and it doesn't add up
I know it comes from above
I've got miracles on miracles, a million little miracles, yeah
Miracles on miracles, count your miracles
One, two, three, four, I can't even count 'em all
Yeah
You held me steady so I wouldn't give up
You opened doors that nobody could shut
I hope I never get over what You've done
I wanna live with an open heart
I wanna live like I know who You are
I hope I never get over what You've done
e got some scars but that's how you learn
It's nothing short of a miracle I'm here
I think it over and it doesn't add up
I know it comes from above
I've got miracles on miracles, a million little miracles, yeah
Miracles on miracles, count your miracles
One, two, three, four, I can't even count 'em all
