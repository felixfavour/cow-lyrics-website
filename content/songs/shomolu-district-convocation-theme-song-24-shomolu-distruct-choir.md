My child
Don’t be afraid 
Don’t be dismayed 
Your time is near

My child
I have a plan
To give you peace
And blow your mind

Once i have spoken twice you have heard
That power belongs to me
If you believe, you'll surely see
Who i am (Who i am)

I'm Jehovah overdo
The God who is able to do
Exceedingly, Abundantly 
Above all, you ask or think
Your life is about to change
Coz i'm gonna blow your mind
Yes, i'm gonna blow your mind

So rejoice and sing and dance in the Holy Ghost
