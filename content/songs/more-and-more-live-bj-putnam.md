And all we want and all we need is found in Jesus
And all we ask is more of You
'Cause nothing else will satisfy our heart's desire
All we want is more of You, more of You
For the Lord is good and His love endures
Yes, the Lord is good forever
And I'll shout it out from the mountaintops
Yes, the Lord is good forever
And all we want and all we need is found in Jesus
And all we ask is more of You
'Cause nothing else will satisfy our heart's desire
And all we want is more of You, more of You
For the Lord is good and His love endures
Yes, the Lord is good forever
And I'll shout it out from the mountaintops
Yes, the Lord is good forever
For the Lord is good and His love endures
Yes, the Lord is good forever
And I'll shout it out from the mountaintops
Yes, the Lord is good forever
