its not a secret
it's not a fairytale
it's not made up Jonah was in a whale
three whole days 123
the greatest treasure
the word God's people wrote
is in the Bible
when Noah built a boat
and it rained and rained
the rainbows in the sky to show God's promises are true
the rainbows in the sky to show the world
he's the only way for your everyday  2x
...
the rainbows in the sky to show God's promises are true
the rainbows in the sky to show the world he's the only way
the rainbows in the sky to show God's promises are true
the rainbows in the sky to show the world he's the only way
the rainbows in the sky to show God's promises are true
the rainbows in the sky to show the world he's the only way for your everyday for your everyday
