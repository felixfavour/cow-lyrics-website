Lord, my heart cries out, glory to the King
My greatest love in life, I hand You everything
Glory, glory, I hear the Angels sing
Open my ears, let me hear Your voice
To know that sweet sound, oh my soul rejoice
Glory, glory, I hear the Angels sing
You're the Father to the fatherless
The answer to my dreams
I see You crowned in righteousness
We cry glory to the King
Comforter to the lonely, the Lifter of my head
I see You veiled in majesty
We cry glory, glory, we cry glory to the King
We cry glory, glory, we cry glory to the King
Lord, my heart cries out, glory to the King
My greatest love in life, I hand You everything
Glory, glory, I hear the Angels sing
Open my ears, let me hear your voice
To know that sweet sound, oh my soul rejoice
Glory, glory, I hear the Angels sing
