All hail the power of Jesus' name
Let angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him Lord of all
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him Lord of all
Ye chosen seed of Israel's race
Ye ransomed from the fall
Hail Him who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all
Hail Him who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all
Raise up the crown, rise on the praises
Rest on the brow of the King of the ages
Raise up the crown, rise on the praises
Rest on the brow of the King of the ages
Raise up the crown, rise on the praises
Rest on the brow of the King of the ages
Raise up the crown, rise on the praises
Rest on the brow of the King of the ages
O that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall
We'll join the everlasting song
And crown Him Lord of all
We'll join the everlasting song
And crown Him Lord of all
