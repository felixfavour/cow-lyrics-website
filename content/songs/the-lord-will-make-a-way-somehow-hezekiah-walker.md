Like a ship that's tossed and driven
Battered by an angry sea
When the storms of life are raging
And their fury falls on me
I wonder what I have done
To make this race so hard to run
(Then I say to my soul, soul take courage)
The Lord will make a way somehow
The Lord will make a way somehow
This teacher's journey may not be easy
You did not say it would be
Sometimes I get so lonely and disheartened (Oh Lord)
And I just don't want to be bothered
Then I began to think Lord what I have done
To make this race so hard for me to run
Then I say to my soul, soul take courage
The Lord will make a way somehow
The Lord will make a way somehow
