This is the moment
This is the hour
You’re here in My presence
You’re touching My power
How I’ve longed for this moment
How I’ve longed for this day
Come away My beloved
To Our secret place
Enter into My presence
Enter into My mercy and grace
This is My holy place
This is My secret place
Receive My love and grace
As We stand face to face
Now let My healing flow
I want the world to know
This is My secret place
This is My holy place
If you listen you’ll hear it
A call to the nations
To show forth My praises
To ev’ry tongue tribe and nation
If you will not tell them
How will they know
That there’s joy in My presence
Like they’ve never known
Bring them into My presence
Let them worship before My Throne
