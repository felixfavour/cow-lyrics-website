[Chorus]
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer so we can be where You are
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer so we can be where You are
All we want is to be in the room with you Jesus
All we need is to spend a little time with You
It's my desire to shout Your praises
And nothing matters as long as you fill the room
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer so we can bе where You are
Comе a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer so we can be where You are
All we want is to be in the room with you Jesus
All we need is to spend a little time with You
It's our desire to shout Your praises
And nothing matters as long as you fill the room
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer so we can be where You are
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer so we can be where You are
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer so we can be where You are
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer so we can be where You are
