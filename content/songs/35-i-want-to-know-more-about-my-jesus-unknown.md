While travelling through this world of sorrow. I'm on my way to glory land.
I'll not turn back for some tomorrow,
My trials here I'll understand.

I want to know more (I want to know more) about my Jesus (yes I do)
I want to know more (yes I want to know more) about my Lord (my blessed Lord)

I want to know more (I want to know more) about that mansion (heavenly mansion) I'm gonna receive (I'm gonna receive) as my reward (my rich reward)
I want to know more (I want to know more) about that homeland (wonderful homeland)

And I mean to go there (I mean to go there) someday, somehow (someday, somehow). And after I reach (after I reach) that heavenly city (heavenly city). I mean to know more (yes I'm gonna know more) that I know now (than I know now)

I'm glad I know the blessed Savior, for thru His blood he set me free. Tho rough the road, I shall not waver, for some glad day, His face I'll see. 

I want to know more (I want to know more) about my Jesus (yes I do)
I want to know more (yes I want to know more) about my Lord (my blessed Lord)

I want to know more (I want to know more) about that mansion (heavenly mansion) I'm gonna receive (I'm gonna receive) as my reward (my rich reward)
I want to know more (I want to know more) about that homeland (wonderful homeland)

And I mean to go there (I mean to go there) someday, somehow (someday, somehow). And after I reach (after I reach) that heavenly city (heavenly city). I mean to know more (yes I'm gonna know more) that I know now (than I know now)

He promised when His soul ascended, I'm coming back the Lord did say. If on His promise, you've depended. On wings of love, you'll soar away.

I want to know more (I want to know more) about my Jesus (yes I do)
I want to know more (yes I want to know more) about my Lord (my blessed Lord)

I want to know more (I want to know more) about that mansion (heavenly mansion) I'm gonna receive (I'm gonna receive) as my reward (my rich reward)
I want to know more (I want to know more) about that homeland (wonderful homeland)

And I mean to go there (I mean to go there) someday, somehow (someday, somehow). And after I reach (after I reach) that heavenly city (heavenly city). I mean to know more (yes I'm gonna know more) that I know now (than I know now)
