Hillsong-Oceans
     .....
You call me out upon the waters,
    The great unknown, where feet may fail.
And there I found you in the mystery,
   In oceans deep, my faith will stand.
And I will call upon your name,
   And keep my eyes above the waves,
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in your embrace
       For I am yours, and you are mine....
Your grace abounds in deepest waters,
Your Sovereign hand, will be my guide.
   Where feet may fail and feet surrounds me,
Will never fails and you wont start now. ..
And I will call upon your name,
And keep my eyes above the waves,
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in your embrace,
        For I am yours and you are mine,!ohhh....
And u are mine..... ohhhhh
  ...Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders,
Let me walk upon the waters, wherever you will call me
