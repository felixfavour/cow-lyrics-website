rling
Come around in the morning
Catch me tired and yawning
Welcome in that's a sure thing
Go for chips and our four wings
Tryna make it one quick ting
Asking me if I will sing
Asking her what she will bring
Tryna know her worth
Too many been returned
Did you rise up from the Earth
Or the heavens were you birthed
And soon to learn you're nice
Don't care about no price
And the ice all on my yard
The cold all in my heart
But she warm
She warm, warm, warm
I feel at home
With that girl
Can freely roam
A sweet new world
My pineapple
My pineapple
Crazy
Kissing roses and daisies
Shower you with the honey
We don't have any money
Chasing you like a dummy
Elmer Fudd and the bunny
Eggs you like em all runny
Darker days you made sunny
Need you in my life
I'm making you my wife
We cut our hands with knives
Entwined until we die
And comfort is a curse
Still losing you is worse
Bun talking on the phone
I need you in my home
Cause she's a perfect picture
Defect mirror
Suspect figure
Conflict killer
Fruit so tasty
Cute but hasty
Never played me
She's my safety
She warm
Warm, warm, warm
I feel at home
With that girl
Can freely roam
A sweet new world
My pineapple
My pineapple
She warm
Warm, warm, warm
I feel at home
With that girl
Can freely roam
A sweet new world
My pineapple
My pineapple
She warm
Warm, warm, warm
I feel at home
With that girl
Can freely roam
A sweet new world
My pineapple
My pineapple
