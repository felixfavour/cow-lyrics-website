If I was an Eagle... I would lift myself,  spread my wings and fly
If I was a Lion... I would run into the jungle and give the loudest roar
And if I was the sun... Yes I would rise early in the morning and shine my light so bright
If I was an angel... I would sound the alarm for the whole of creation to bow at Your feet
Yepa! Kabiyesi Olu-orun... I have come to give You twale (To give You twale)
To give You worship (To give You worship)
Kabiyesi Olu-orun o... I have come to give You twale (To give You twale)
To give you worship (To give You worship)
Eheheh... Ohohohoh
Huuu yeah! If I was a little child... I would sing and shout for joy
If I was a stallion o... I would use my horse power
If I was a shinning star... I would illuminate everywhere
And if I was the son of a governor... I would make every body throway salute o
And if I could control the times... I would go back to the garden of Eden
I would give You the worship that only You deserve... Yes!
I would look for beautiful names... Like Aladewura o
Yes I would go on soun and p'atewo iye, gb'oruko re ga o
Kabiyesi Olu-orun... I have come to give You twale (To give You twale)
To give You worship (To give You worship)
Oooh, Kabiyesi Olu-orun o... I have come to give You twale (To give You twale)
To give you worship (To give You worship)
Yes oh! Kabi√¥omasi o... I was made to give You twale o (To give You twale)
I'm to give You worship (To give You worship)
Gbanigbani t'ansaya Ologo Imole o... I was made to give You twale (To give You twale)
To bow down with the elders (To give You worship)
I say... Only a fool will look into the heavens and say there is no God
Only a mad man will look into the seas and claim that the fishes are a mistake
Even the babalawos can testify that there is only one Jehovah
So who are you to tell me that my Yahweh, my Tsikenu doesn't exist
He's a consuming fire o, Yes He's the Lion of the tribe of Judah
Him alone shall I serve o... For the rest of my days
(Does anyone wanna give God some praise)
My father who art in heaven, I have come to give You twale. (To give You twale)
I've come to sing (To give You worship)... to You
Does anybody in the house wanna give God praise, let me give You twale (To give You twale)
Let me see you put your praise on (To give You worship)
Oooh yeah! Even if I had a million tongues they will never ever be enough (To give You twale)
To give You all the worship (To give You worship)
You are the Lord... that is Your name, that is why we've come (To give You twale)
To give You all the praise!
