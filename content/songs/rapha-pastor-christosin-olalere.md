RAPHA, my whole Healer
RAPHA, my whole Healer
You make everything whole
Never will I be bound

You heal me; never will I be bound
You free me; never will I be bound
You save me; never will I be bound

Jireh, my provider
Jireh, my provider
My cup runs overflow
Never will I be poor

You help me; never will I be poor
You bless me; never will I be poor
You maintain my lot; never will I be poor

ROHI, my great shepherd
ROHI, my great shepherd
Green pastures, you lead me.
Never will I be blind

You guide me; never will I be blind
You shield me; never will I be blind
You always show the way; never will I be blind
