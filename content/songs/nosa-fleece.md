Need to know that you're alright
Way we left things it weren't fine
Things that I said weren't a lie
Still hurts to see how you cry
When you know things went to bits
You ran so fast for the quits
You wanted someone that sits
But this dog he's got all his wits
Ready to go and I tried for you
Ready to show all my fight for you
You didn't even try hear it
Ball was goal bound and you cleared it
Leaving me down on a score line
Why can't you give us some more time
Time is the healer of all wounds
Come meet down in the ballroom
Rather it there than a courtroom
Prevention is better than cure
Both parties need to be sure
Love sure just knows how to lure
The cleanest of ones will go die for that
The freest of ones ain't got time for that
The game has been played and they hate it
Don't wait for peace they go take it
And I say you're just like a fleece
You're warm but you stole things from me
My time and future memories
Oh why did we cross energies
And I say you're just like a fleece
You're warm but you stole things from me
My time and future memories
Oh why did we cross energies
You're just like a fleece
Just like a fleece
Just like a fleece
Just like a fleece
Woah
Just like a fleece
