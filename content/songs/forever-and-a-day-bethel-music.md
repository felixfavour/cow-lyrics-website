[Instrumental]
I was afraid, Your love set me free
I was in debt, You paid the price for me
And I was hurt, You took away my pain
I was alone, until You called my name
And I was broken, and You mended me
Before I was, You loved me
You healed my body, and You made me whole
No matter what I do, You don't let go
And I will sing to the King
And I am the ransomed one
And how I love Your holy name
Holy to the Lamb who was slain
And when I laugh and when I cry
You are the reason why
And how I long to be with You
Forever and a day
Oh, forever and a day
When I go to bed, You are near
When I wake up, You are there
When I call Your name, You are here
When I walk in faith, You're everywhere
You catch and save every tear I cry
You journal everyday all about my life
Your love for me reaches to the sky
And I am Yours, and You are mine
