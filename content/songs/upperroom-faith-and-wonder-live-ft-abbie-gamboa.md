is name that shakes the mountain tops
The only word that breaks the curses off
Your name the one that covers all
It's higher than the others, higher than the others
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other
Name but Yours, name but Yours
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other
Name but Yours, name but Yours
This name that storms the gates of hell
The only word my life will live to tell
All the earth will bow beneath the sound
Higher than the others, higher than the others
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other
Name but Yours, name but Yours
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other
Name but Yours, name but Yours
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus, oh
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus, yeah
Sing it louder, oh the name of Jesus
There is power
There is power in the name of Jesus, eh-ehh
Sing it louder, oh the name of Jesus, Jesus!
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other
Name but Yours, name but Yours
Full of faith and wonder
I will say no other
Name but Yours, name but Yours
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
There's power in the name of Jesus
Power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
We believe You, Lord, we sing
There is power in the name of Jesus
We declare
There is power in the name of Jesus, Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
