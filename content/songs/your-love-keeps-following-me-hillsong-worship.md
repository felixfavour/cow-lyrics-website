[Chorus]
And it's higher
Reaches from heaven to man
It's wider
Anyone can come in
It's deeper
It covers any sin
And I know this one thing
Wherever I go I know
Your love keeps following me
You loved me as You found me
Your love keeps following me
You wrapp'd Your arms around me
Your love keeps following me
By grace I'm what I should be
Your love keeps following me
You saw me as I could be
Your love keeps following me
[Ending]
Your love keeps following me
Your love keeps following me
Your love keeps following me
Your love keeps following me
