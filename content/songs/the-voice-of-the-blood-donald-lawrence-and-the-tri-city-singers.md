Thus sayeth the Lord
To the congregation of Israel
Take the blood of the lamb
The blood of the lamb
Take the blood, the blood of the lamb
Mm-mm
Thus sayeth the Lord
To the congregation of Israel
Take the blood of the lamb
Oh, the blood of the lamb
Take the blood, the blood of the lamb
And when I see the blood
I'll pass over, pass over
Pass over, when I see the blood
Oh-ooh, when I see the blood
I'll pass over, pass over
Pass over, when I see the blood
Oh-ooh-oh
The voice of Abel's blood
It cried of hurt and pain
But the lamb that was slain
Revived the souls again
Jesus' blood speaks a better word, oh
