Jesus, Lover of my soul
Jesus, I would never let your go
You've taken me from the miry clay
You set my feet upon a rock, now I know
I love you, I need you
Though my world may fall, I would never let you go
My saviour, my closest friend
I will worship you, until the very end
Jesus, Lover of my soul
Jesus, I would never let your go
You've taken me from the miry clay
You set my feet upon a rock, now I know
I love you, I need you
Though my world may fall, I would never let you go
My saviour, my closest friend
I will worship you, until the very end
Jesus, Lover of my soul
Jesus, I would never let your go
You've taken me from the miry clay
You set my feet upon a rock, now I know
I love you, I need you
Though my world may fall, I would never let you go
My saviour, my closest friend
I will worship you, until the very end
I love you, I need you
Though my world may fall, I would never let you go
My saviour, my closest friend
I will worship you, until the very end
