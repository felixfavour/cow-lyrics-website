Son of God
Carried the cross of redemption
Crown of thorns
Placed on the head of perfection
[Chorus: Abby Vestnys & Zach Vestnys]
Jesus, gloria
Jesus, my King
Nail-pierced hands
Scars that remind me of mercy
Arms out wide
Welcoming all who are guilty
Into the light of Your glory
[Chorus: Abby Vestnys & Zach Vestnys]
Jesus, gloria
Jesus, my King
Oh, You are Jesus, gloria
Jesus, my King
[Bridge: Abby Vestnys & Zach Vestnys]
And how great the heart of the Father
How great the mercy of God
How great the price that He paid for love
How great the heart of the Fathеr
How great the mercy of God
How grеat the price that He paid for love
Oh, the price that He paid for love
