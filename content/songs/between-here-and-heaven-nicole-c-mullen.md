You save an empty bottle to put your teardrops in
Bleeding your case to God while he remain silent
He is listening
He's counting every tear and hears you when you pray
He'll answer in His time so don't give up the faith
He knows what we need
Keep on pushing through even when you feel your prayers are lost
Somewhere between here and heaven know God holds them all safely in
You save an empty bottle to put your teardrops in
His hands He's got a plan and they're
Not lost somewhere between here and heaven
And now the days can turn into months or years
You're tired of praying and fighting all the fear
What let God be your rest
And keep on pushing through
Even when you feel your prayers are
Lost somewhere between here and heaven
Know God holds them all safely in his hands and He's got a
Plan and they're not lost somewhere between here and heaven
You see the pieces
Oh
But he sees the picture
So give your time
He'll put it all together
Together
So keep on pushing through even when you feel your
Prayers are lost somewhere between here and heaven
Know God holds them all safely in his hands he's got a plan
And they're not lost somewhere between here and heaven
