When night has fallen
When fear is common
Still You're calling me
When faith is lost, and
My hope exhausted
You will be my strength
[Pre-Chorus]
When my mind says I'm not good enough
God, You're enough for me
I've decided I'm not giving up
You won't give up on me
You won't give up on me
Your love is holding on and it won't let go
I feel it breaking out like an echo
Your love is holding on and it won't let go
I feel it breaking out like an echo
[Post-Chorus]
Echo in my soul, whoa
In every season
You keep repeating
Promises to me
Now there's no stopping
What You have started
Until it is complete
