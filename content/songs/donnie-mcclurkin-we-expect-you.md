"We Expect You"
We expect You, anytime, anytime
And how we wait to see Your blessed face
Lord, Your blessed face
And we expect You anytime
We expect You, anytime, anytime
And how we wait to see Your blessed face
Your blessed face
Lord we expect You, we expect You
Oh, we expect You anytime
So until You return, Lord, we will
Keep the fire burning
Keep the wheels turning
Keep the praises ringing in our souls
How our hearts are yearning
Just for Your returning
You promised to come and take us home
You promised to take us home, take us home
We expect You, we expect You
We expect You anytime
