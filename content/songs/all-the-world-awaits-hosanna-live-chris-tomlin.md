All the world awaits
The promise of His birth
Open up the gates
Heaven come to earth
A host of Angels sing
Our Savior here to dwell
The King of every King
Our Emmanuel
Hosanna
Hosanna
Hosanna
Hosanna
In the highest
Hosanna to our God
Behold the Son of man
Here in a manger lay
Worthy is the lamb
For He has come to save
To take away our sin
He freely gave His life
Born that we may live
And in Him never die
