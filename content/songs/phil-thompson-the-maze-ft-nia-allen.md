Twisting around the bend and back again for too long
There was no traction when I tried to climb the wall
Trapped in a circle of life
With no end in sight
But You saw me in the maze
And pulled me out of darkness
And the essence of my praise
Is centered on Your grace
Centered on Your grace
Every winding road all seem to go nowhere
Every cry for help fell down upon deaf ears
That's when I called out Your name
Everything changed
When You saw me in the maze
And pulled me out of darkness
And the essence of my praise
Is centered on Your grace
You saw me in the maze
You pulled me out of darkness
And the essence of my praise
Is centered on Your grace
Is centered on Your grace
(x3)
I'd be lost in the dark
Without Your light shining the way
I'd be lost in the dark
Without Your guidance
I will be hopeless
(x2)
But You saw me in the maze
And You pulled me out of darkness
And the essence of my praise
Is centered on Your grace
Is centered on Your grace
(x3)
Centered on Your grace
