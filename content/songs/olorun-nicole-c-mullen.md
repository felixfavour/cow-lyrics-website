O God who created mountains of those days
Only You we give all of our praise
Ọlọrun t'o da awon Oke Igbani
Eyin ni mo fi ọpe mi fun
Tani n'wo tun gbe ga o
Bi ko se Baba l'oke
Tani n'wo tun fi gbogbo ọpe mi fun
It is You who created mountains of those days
Only You we give all of our praise
Ọlọrun t'o da awon Oke Igbani
Eyin ni mo fi ọpe mi fun (O God)
O God who created mountains of those days
Only You we give all of our praise
Who then must be lifted high if not our heavenly Father
Who then must we give all of our praise

Tani n'wo tun fi gbogbo ọpe mi fun
It, it is You who created mountains of those days
Only You we give all of our praise
