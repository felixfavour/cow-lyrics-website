Where will I go without Your hand holding me?
How could I live without You? I could not see
Lord, what would I do in life and where would I go?
How would I handle things?
All that I know
Is I fail, again
Lord I fall, I fall so short, so short
You know, You know my end Lord
From the start, You know my heart
I Need You, I need You
Tell me now, were would I, were would I go?
Where will I go without your hand holding me?
(How could I live with out you, I could not see) How would I live without You? I could not see
(What would I do and where would I go?) What will I do in Life and where will I go?
(How would I handle things?) How would I handle things?
(All that I know) All that I know
Say
I fail (I fail), again (again Lord)
I fall (fall), I fall so short (I fall so short)
You know (know), You know my end (know my end Lord)
From the start (from the start), You know my heart
Everybody say, say
I need you
(Raise your voice and say) I need you
(Say it again, say I need you) I need you
(Say tonight say) I need you
Help me out here, say
When I call (call)
You hear me (You hear me)
When I call Your name (call)
You're near me (You're near me)
Your hand is there Lord (hand)
To hold (to hold me)
Need you Lord (I need You Lord, I need You)
When I call (call)
You hear my voice Lord (You hear me)
When I call Your name Lord (call)
You're right near me (You're near me)
Your hand is there (hand)
To hold me (to hold me)
Need you (I need You Lord, I need You)
When I call (call)
You hear me Lord (You hear me)

I fall, so short hallelujah
You know, You know my end Lord
From the very start, you know my heart
Everybody just say
I need You (gotta mean it from your heart)
I need You (say it and I mean it, say it and I mean it)
I need You (oh, yes I do)
I need You (just can't make it without You, can't make it without You)
I need you (everybody sing, everybody sing, everybody sing)
I need you (I just can't make it without You, can't make it without You)
I need you (not another day, not another moment Lord)
I need you
