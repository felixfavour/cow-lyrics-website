Where do you stand
What is your statement
What is it you're trying to say
What's in your hand
What's in your basement
What's in the cards you don't play
Are you holding the key
Or are you intending
To pick the lock of heaven's gate
It's confusing to me
The message you're sending
And I don't know if I can relate
What's your line
Tell me why you wear your cross of gold
State of mind
Or does it find a way into your soul
Is it a flame
Is it a passion
A symbol of love living in you
(Living in you)
