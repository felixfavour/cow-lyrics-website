Humbly I wait
Here in Your presence
Oh how I need You
Quiet my soul
I long for Your whisper
Oh how I need You
[Pre-Chorus]
Jesus
Oh, Jesus
As I worship in surrender
I feel heaven drawing closer
As I lay down my defenses
Your love invades and I brace for the impact
I am undone
Lost in Your glory
Oh how I love You
Covered in grace
Found in Your mercy
Oh how I love You, yeah
