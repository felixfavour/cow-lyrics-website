Magnify the Lord with me
Let us exalt His name forever and ever
Magnify the Lord with me
Let us exalt His name forever and ever
I will bless the Lord at all times
I will bless the Lord at all times
I will bless the Lord at all times
His praise will continually be in my mouth
His praise will continually be in my mouth
My soul will boast in the Lord
(I will exalt His name forever and ever)
He has filled my life with joy
(I will exalt His name forever and ever)
Magnify the Lord with me
Let us exalt His name forever and ever
Magnify the Lord with me
Let us exalt His name forever and ever
I will bless the Lord at all times
I will bless the Lord at all times
I will bless the Lord at all times
His praise will continually be in my mouth
His praise will continually be in my mouth
My life belongs to the Lord
(I will exalt His name forever and ever)
I will sing His praise forevermore
(I will exalt His name forever and ever)
