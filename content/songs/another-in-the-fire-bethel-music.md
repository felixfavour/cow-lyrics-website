There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the water
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I'vе been set free
There is a cross that bеars that burden
Where another died for me
There is another in the fire, ooh
All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won't bow to the things of this world
I know I will never be alone
There is another in the fire
Standing next to me
There is another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
What power sets me free
There is a grave that holds no body
And now that power lives in me
