The Son of Man in agony
He cried out, "Take this cup from Me
And not My will, let Yours be done
Not My will, let Yours be done"The choice would cost Him everything
The weight of sin poured out on Him
And not my will, let Yours be done
[Pre-Chorus]
He counted the cost
That all the world would know this love
And now my response
Is my yes and once and for all
I say "yes" to the cost
I say "yes" to the cost
I say "yes" to the cost
I say "yes"And I say "yes" to the cost
I say "yes" to the cost
I say "yes"The fear of man is drowning now
The fear of God has filled my soul
I cannot be silent, no
I will not be silent, no
A passive life I will not live
Awake my soul to burn again
I cannot be silent, no
