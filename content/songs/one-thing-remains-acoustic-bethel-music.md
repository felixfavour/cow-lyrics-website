[Intro]
Ooh-ooh--ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Higher than the mountains that I face
Stronger than the power of the grave
Constant in the trial and the change
This one thing remains
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
On and on and on and on it goes
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I'll never, ever, have to be afraid
This one thing, it remains
This one thing, it remains
Your love never fails, it never gives up, it never runs out on me
Your love never fails, it never gives up, it never runs out on me
Your love never fails, it never gives up, it never runs out on me
Your love
