When you called on me,
With the vision to follow you,
 
I wasn't sure of exactly what lay ahead for me,
But I heard you say come and walk with me 
 
Although I've heard of your fame before,
From the mouth of your very friends
 
What I've seen and heard surpasses all they said of you,
Why I walk with you
 
Chorus 1
I have been upon the mountain tops,
I have walked where the eagles nest
 
Amidst the thunder and the lightning of the words you speak to me,
It's why I walk with you
 
Take me deeper into the heights of glory,
Where the eye of the eagles' never seen
 
Amidst the thunder and the lightning of the words you speak to me,
I love to walk you
 
Verse 2
I was afraid I must confess,
That if I told you all the best Of my heart
 
Would you laugh at me and walk away,
Or would you still walk with me
 
Can't explain why I waited so long,
Just to tell you from the depths of my heart
 
What the joy of walking with you has meant to me
I love to walk with you.
Chorus 2
I have been upon the mountain tops,
I have walked where the eagles nest,
 
Amidst the thunder and the lightning of your word you speak to me,
I love to walk with you
 
Oh Take me deeper into the heights of glory,
Where the eye of the eagles never seen
 
I'm captivated by the thunder and the lightning of Your words,
Why I walk with you
 
  
All creation declares Your praise,
And all the angels of glory agree
 
From the crown of my head to the soles of my feet,
I love to walk with You
 
Ooh take me deeper into the heights of glory
Where the eye of the eagles' never seen
 
Am captivated by the thunder and the lightning of your word
 
Why I walk with You.
 
Ooh take me deeper into the heights of glory,
Where the eye of the eagles never seen
 
Am captivated by the thunder and the lightning of your word,
Why I walk with you 
 
Verse 4
Every word You speak is life,
And every breath just revives my soul
 
They're all preparing me to face the battles up ahead
I love to walk with You
