Your waves and Your breakers
Wash over me
Deep calls to deep
In the mystery
[Pre-Chorus: Cody Carnes]
I don't wanna wait a moment more
You're here, right here
I'm just gonna throw open the door
My heart is Yours
[Chorus: Cody Carnes]
'Til the end of time (time)
'Til the end of time (time)
I'm Yours
'Til the end of time (time
3
)
I'm Yours, You're mine
Your name is my safe house
My refuge
Savior, my anchor
I run to You
[Pre-Chorus: Kari Jobe]
I don't wanna wait a moment more
You're here, right here
I'm just gonna throw open the door
My heart is Yours
