I remember when you came into my life
Just like the movies, you were my shining light
All the problems I had just seemed to melt away
Cause in your presence I can feel so safe
Today I give my life and I say
All my life
To the end of my days
I will share my love
And you know you have my praise
Your the best one decision
That I have ever made
And I wouldn't trade the world for you
To the left, To the left
Is where I was headed
But your love got me right back on the road to you
Where would I be if you hadn't saved my life
Forever and a day, I will
Forever and a day, you've got me
