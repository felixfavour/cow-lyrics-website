Your love reaches out to me
Your grace has made a way to you
Made a way to you
Your word lives inside of me
Your truth is life to all who hear
Life to all who hear
We live for you
Live your truth
May your kingdom come
And your will be done
As we serve your heart
Serve your heart
Let salvation flow
As your people pray
Lord we long for more
Long for more
In you death is overcome
No power can stand against your name
The power of your name
In faith we will rise to be
Your hands and feet to all the earth
Life to all the earth
