Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and Heaven and nature sing
[Refrain]
We will sing sing sing
Joy to the world
We will sing sing sing
Joy to the world the Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repеat the sounding joy
Repeat rеpeat the sounding joy
[Refrain]
We will sing sing sing
Joy to the world
We will sing sing sing
