There was a time I truly believed
That I could do it on my own
But all that I found at the end of that road is
That concept for me was all wrong
But I found a Savior who turned me around
And He placed His love on me
And I will trust in You till my last heartbeat
Some put their trust in earthly possessions
But in the end, it won't bring them through
I will not lean to my own understanding
But with my whole heart, here's what I'll do
trust in the name of the Lord
(In the name) trust in the name of the Lord
(Of the Lord) Lord, I will
(Lord, I'll trust in You)
trust in the name of the Lord
(In the name) trust in the name of the Lord
(Of the Lord) for I know
He will see me through
The name of The Lord is a mighty strong tower
The righteous run in and they're safe
I will trust You
trust in the name of the Lord
(In the name) trust in the name of the Lord
(Of the Lord) Lord, I will
(Lord, I'll trust in You)
trust in the name of the Lord
(In the name) trust in the name of the Lord
(Of the Lord) for I know
He will see me through
trust in the name of the Lord
(In the name) trust in the name of the Lord
(Of the Lord) Lord, I will
(Lord, I'll trust in You)
the name of the Lord, in the name
(In the name) strong tower, strong tower
(Of the Lord) the righteous run in and they're saved
He will see me through
trust in the name of the Lord
(In the name) trust in the name of the Lord
(Of the Lord) Lord, I will
(Lord, I'll trust in You)
Lord, in You
trust in the name of the Lord
(In the name) trust in the name of the Lord
(Of the Lord) Lord, I will
(Lord, I'll trust in You)
trust in the name of the Lord
(In the name) trust in the name of the Lord
(Of the Lord) for I know
