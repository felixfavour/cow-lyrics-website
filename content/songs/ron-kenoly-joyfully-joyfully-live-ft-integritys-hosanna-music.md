Joyfully, joyfully
We are going up
To dedicate our hearts
To the Lord
Joyfully, joyfully
We are going up
We come into His presence
With joy
God has said He'd dwell
In the praises of His people
He is seeking those who'll
Worship Him in spirit and in truth
With our hands lifted up
And our mouths filled with praise
With singing and dancing
And joy we celebrate
Hallelujah, hallelujah
We enter His presence with
Joy, joy, joy
Hallelujah, hallelujah
We dedicate our hearts
To the Lord
