There is a name I love to call
It stands alone and conquers all
And every chain and every wall
Will be released and have to fall
Jesus

There is a name I love to call
It stands alone and conquers all
We call Your name for every wall
And Jericho will have to fall

Until the day I see Your face
And feel the warmth of Your embrace
I'll shout Your name through all the pain
No other name, Your precious name
