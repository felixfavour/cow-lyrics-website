Behold the lamb
Behold the lamb
Upon a white horse he returns
In majesty faithful and true
He triumphs now to rule and to reign
His eyes like fire
His head full crowned
He holds the nations in his hands
In awesome power with victory sure
He rides in judgement and to war
Behold the Lamb
Behold the Lamb
In shame and sorrow
Once he came
No crown of thorns
No cross of pain
He stands revealed in glory now
All heaven resounds
He takes his throne
To rule the earth
His world reclaim
We all will hail
With one accord
The king of kings
And lord of lords
Behold the lamb
Behold the lamb
Upon a white horse
He returns
We all will hail
With one accord
The king of kings
And lord of lords
Behold the lamb
Behold the lamb
Upon a white horse
He returns
We all will hail
With one accord
The king of kings
And lord of lords
Behold the lamb
Behold the lamb
Upon a white horse
He returns
We all will hail
With one accord
The king of kings
And lord of lords
The king of kings
And lord of lords
