I'm looking at you
Old friend of mine
It's no use pretending
That everything's fine
So don't be so brave
Don't be so proud
I want you to know that
I'm here for you now
I can see you hurting and it's hurting me
It doesn't have to be this way
Chorus:
If you'd let me hold you
Closer
Let me know you
Let me show you the way
(Cantor during chorus)
Somebody gonna hold you head up
Somebody gonna show you the light
Somebody gonna hold you head up
Somebody gonna see you right
I'm feeling for you
Feeling so much
When this heart is big enough
For the both of us
