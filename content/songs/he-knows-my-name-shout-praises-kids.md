Lord we lift up our hands to you Jesus
Father we love you
I have a Maker
He formed my heart
Before even time began
My life was in his hands
He knows my name
He knows my every thought
He sees each tear that falls
And hears me when I call
I have a father
He calls me his own
He'll never leave me
No matter where I go
He knows my name
He knows my every thought
He sees each tear that falls
And hears me when I call
He knows my name
He knows my every thought
He sees each tear that falls
And hears me when I call
