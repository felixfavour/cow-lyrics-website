Persecuted not abandoned
Struck down not destroyed
We are more than overcomers
Hardpressed but not crushed
Oh Lord, our Lord
We run to you
Our hope, our strength
We trust in you
Heaven is open
Blessings are pouring over us
Creation is groaning
For sons and daughters to rise up
Chasing your glory
Chasing your glory
Ooo
We're changing our story
We're being transformed from glory to glory
