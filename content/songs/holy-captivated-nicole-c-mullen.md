When I Behold the Beauty
Of Your Many Wonders
And I'm Captivated by
Your Majesty
Oh my Soul Rings Out
A Sacred Hallelujah
Back to the Source
From Whence it Came
And when
I'm Searching
For the Face
Of the Invisible
When I Reach
To hold the Hand
That Formed
My Being
All of a Sudden
Everything that
Is Within me
Blesses your Name
Again and Again
