I could sound a thousand voice
It's not enough to sing Your praise
Mighty One, the great I am
There is no one else like You
You made the ocean deep and wide
You made the sky so beautiful
Only You can do these things
There is no one else like You
Oba awon Oba
Kabiesi
Only You can do these things
There is no one else like You
Oba awon Oba
Kabiyesi
Only You can do these things
There is no one else like You
All the angels bow to You
Worthy worthy is the Lamb
That was slain just for my sake
Lord You've been so good to me
Halleluyah to the Lion
Halleluyah to the Lamb
Mighty God I bow to You
In adoration to Your name
Oba awon Oba
Kabiesi
Only You can do these things
There is no one else like You
Oba awon Oba
Kabiesi
Only You can do these things
There is no one else like You
