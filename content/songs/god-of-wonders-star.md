yeaaaah
yeah yah
wonders

Chorus :God of Awesome wonders
wonders without number
you're faithful til the end
you reign your majesty……..2x

I've seen you work in the world
And in my life
time after time
Philip said show us the father
yet I know you
you're more than true

when Jesus passed by,he saw a man which was blind from birth the disciples asked him,saying master,who did sin?
this man & his parents that he was born blind
Jesus said the works of God should manifest in him
he spat on the ground and made clay out of spittle
anointed the eyes of the man and the saw
say

God Awesome wonders
wonders without number
you're faithful til the end
you reign your majesty

God Awesome wonders
without number
without number
wonders without number
you're faithful til the end

you split the sea
raised the dead
gave sight to the blind
the lame walked
today you're doing it again

inconceivable
unfathomable
wonders
you're doing them again
the enemy's eyes can't see yet I've seen your glory wonders! you're doing it again

God Awesome wonders
wonders without number
you're faithful til the end
you reign your majesty

God Awesome wonders
without number
without number
wonders without number
you're faithful til the end

visas are here
cancer is gone
the money is here
God has started a Good work for us and has finished it
SATAN CAME TOOO LATE
