There is mercy in the moments
When the burden is an ocean
In a teardrop
There is healing when the heartache
Weighs a mountain in the grieving
Of a love lost
Only time will tell
All the faithfulness
Of Your hand, Lord
All the joy we'll find
In the grace You sow
In this valley, of tears
Heavy as the sorrow is here
I know there'll come a day when we sing upon these ashes
How Your beauty made this valley so delightful
And we'll laugh upon that mountain
How this Everest of grief became our dance floor
Only time will tell
All the faithfulness
Of Your hand, Lord
All the joy we'll find
In the wild delight
Only Heaven could yield
Heavy as the sorrow is here
I know the Sower never wastes a tear
