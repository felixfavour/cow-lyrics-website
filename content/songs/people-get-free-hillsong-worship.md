The word of God is planted
And living in my heart
I'm an overcom - er
I live His promise out
PreChorus:
This was not a new thing
Until it happened to me
Now I walk in power
I walk in victory
Chorus:
Jesus gave the power to be
All you were meant to be
And people get free
Bridge:
You lose your fears
When you stand in faith
You lose your tears
When you trust His grace
You lose your pain
When you know His touch
Only Christ can turn your bitter
In to sweet and people get free
Ending:
People get free
People get free
People get free
