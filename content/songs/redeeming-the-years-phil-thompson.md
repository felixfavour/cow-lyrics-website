There is beauty for ashes, Hallelujah
The Father hasn’t forgotten about you
A double portion for the shame, Hallelujah
He is here to make all things new
Come receive the harvest
For all you sowed in tears
He’s rewriting your story now
And He’s redeeming the years
Oh, oh, oh, oh
He’s redeeming the years
All you children rise and sing, Hallelujah
The time has come for us to rise
It’s the year of jubilee, Hallelujah
He’s bringing dead things back to life
Come receive the harvest
For all you sowed in tears
He’s rewriting your story now
And He’s redeeming the years
