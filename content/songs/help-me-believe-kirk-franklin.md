[Intro]
I just want to write You a letter
I have to be very honest with You right now
I don't really know how to say this...
I wanna believe
But I'm having a hard time seeing past
What I see right now, I see right now
I wanna be free
But when I try to fly I realize I don't know how
No one showed me how
Wish I could see that this mess I'm in
Will really work out for my good
You said it would
So, if you can hear me, can you give me a sign
Cause I don't feel You like I should, please if You could
My faith is almost gone, I can't hold on much longer
Take this cup from me
[Hook]
Help me believe, can I believe
Let me believe, I wanna believe
I'm no good on my own, please give me another chance
It's hard to believe in what I can't see
To give You my will cause Your wills better for me
You can look in my eyes and see
I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe
