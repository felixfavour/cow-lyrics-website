Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
For I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
The prodigal is welcomed home
The sinner now a saint
For the God who died came back to life
And everything has changed
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
[Pre-Chorus]
O death, where is your sting?
O fear, where is your power?
The mighty King of kings has disarmed you
Delivered and redeemed
Eternal life is ours
O praise His name forever
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
All throughout eternity, our song will be the same
Hallelujah, Christ is risen from the grave
