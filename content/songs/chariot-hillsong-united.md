[Chorus]
Swing low, sweet chariot
Lord, carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
I'm coming on home
There's a light made of Heaven and its fire burns in me
To behold all the brilliance of Your grace and majesty
Though the road looks like madness and the dangers loom unknown
I'm coming on home, Lord, carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Lord, carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
I'm coming on home
Where the night holds no darkness
And Your glory paves those streets
And the depths of Your presence
Makes the ocean seem knee-deep
And the skies drape the table
Where Your mercy minds my seat
'Til I get home, Lord, carry me home
