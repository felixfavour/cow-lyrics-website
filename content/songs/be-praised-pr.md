God be praised.
God be praised,
let the name of the Lord be praised.

Oh, God be praised.
God be praised,
let the name of the Lord be praised.

VERSE
From the rising of the sun,
to the setting of the same,
let the name of the Lord be praised.
And until my dying day,
when there's no more I can say,
let the name of the Lord be praised.

BRIDGE
Praise ye the Lord,
praise God in the sanctuary,
praise Him in the firmament of His power.

Oh, praise ye the Lord,
praise God in the sanctuary,
praise Him, praise Him,
praise ye the Lord.
