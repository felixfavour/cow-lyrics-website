Intro:
1 May I never lose the wonder, of this gospel mystery
From the Heavens came a Savior, from the ground arose a King
Every day is born in darkness, every winter yields to spring
So let us speak of resurrection, even in the suffering
Chorus:
You can do anything, You can do anything
My eyes will see Your glory, my eyes will see Your glory
You can do anything, You can do anything
My eyes will see Your glory, my eyes will see Your glory
Instrumental:
2 As the sisters beggеd the Savior, "Come at once to Bеthany""For the one You love is dying," but His "Yes" was not to be
And as His weeping begged the question, "Could His friend He not have healed?" Oh-oh
But He's still the resurrection, oh-oh, even when the tomb is sealed
Chorus:
You can do anything, You can do anything
My eyes will see Your glory, my eyes will see Your glory
You can do anything, You can do anything
My eyes will see Your glory, my eyes will see Your glory
My eyes will see Your glory, my eyes will see Your glory
