I enter the Holy of Holies
I enter through the blood of the Lamb
I enter to worship You only
I enter to honor I am

Lord I worship You, I worship You,
Lord I worship You, I worship You,
For Your name is Holy, Holy Lord
For Your name is Holy, Holy Lord

Let the weight of Your glory cover us
Let the life of Your river flow
Let the truth of Your kingdom reign in us

Let the weight of Your glory
Let the weight of Your glory fall
