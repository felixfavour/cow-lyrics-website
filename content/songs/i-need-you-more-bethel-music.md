I need You more, more than yesterday
I need You more, more than words can say
I need You more than ever before
I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than the next heartbeat
More than anything
And Lord, as time goes by
I'll be by Your side
'Cause I never want to go back to my old life
I need You more, more than yesterday
I need you more, more than words can say
I need You more than ever before
I need You more
I need You, Lord
And more than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than the next heartbeat
More than anything
And Lord, as time goes by
I'll be by Your side
'Cause I never want to go back to my old life
