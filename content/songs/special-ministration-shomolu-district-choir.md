You are the same
Yesterday , today and forever
No matter what I face
I know
I will prevail

Chorus:
I will prevail ( I will prevail )
In the name of Jesus ( I will prevail )
I will prevail ( I will prevail )
In the name of Jesus I will prevail

Situation may come
Challenges may come
But I’m not moved
And I’m not shaken
The God of Abraham
Isaac and jacob
Is here with me
Always with me
