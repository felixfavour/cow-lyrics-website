King of glory come
I surrender all
Hear my simple song
I love You, Lord, I love You, Lord
King of heaven come
Let Your presence fall
You're saving, You're strong
I love You, Lord, I love You, Lord
[Pre-Chorus]
Jesus, all my heart belongs, to You
Jesus, every heartbeat longs, for You
Oh lover of my soul
Pull me in Your arms forever!
It's You and You alone
Burning in my heart
Oh lover of my soul
You're my one true love
Every breathe is Yours
Hear my greatest song
I love You, Lord, I love You, Lord
