If I surveyed all the good things that come to me from above If I count all the blessings from the storehouse of love I'd simply ask for a favor of him beyond mortal king And I'm sure that he'd grant it again

I want to stroll over Heaven With you some glad day When all our troubles and heartaches Have vanished away
Then we'll enjoy all the beauty Where all things are new I want to stroll over Heaven with you

So many places of beauty we've longed to see here below But time and treasure have kept us from making plans as you know But come the morning of rapture together let's stand anew And then I'll stroll over Heaven with you

I want to stroll over Heaven With you some glad day When all our troubles and heartaches Have vanished away
Then we'll enjoy all the beauty Where all things are new I want to stroll over Heaven with you

We'll renew old acquaintance with the friends we once knew, We'll meet all our loved ones and see Jesus, too. That will be a glad reunion and there'll be much to do While I stroll over heaven with you.

I want to stroll over Heaven With you some glad day When all our troubles and heartaches Have vanished away
Then we'll enjoy all the beauty Where all things are new I want to stroll over Heaven with you
