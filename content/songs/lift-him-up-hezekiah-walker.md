He is worthy, he is worthy
He is worthy, worthy to be praised
From the rising of the sun
To the going down of the same
God is worthy
Come on praise him
Come on praise him
Come on praise him
Come on praise him
Come on praise him
Come on praise him
Come on praise him
Give God all the praise
Give God all the praise
Lift him up
Higher, higher
Lift him up
Higher, higher
