This Joy that You have given me
No One can Take it from me
This Peace that You have given me
Is For Life
Oh Your Presence
Will always be more than Enough
Your Power is more than Enough
You are all that I have
And all that I want
Oh, it's a Journey
And I cannot Tread it Enough
It's forever, it's New every Morning,
It's New every Morning
Oh Your Love is Amazing
I know that Nothing,
Nothing can Separate me
From you, Nothing,
Nothing can come between us
Na, Na nothing,
Nothing can Separate me from
You For Life
I know that Nothing,
Nothing can Separate me
From you, Nothing,
Nothing can come between us
Na, Na nothing,
Nothing can Separate me from
You For Life
It's Forever
Eh, It's Forever
Oh, this Miracle
That You have given me
No Man can Take Away
It's Forever
Eh, It's Forever
Oh, this Joy
That You have given me
No Man can Take Away
Oh Your Presence
Will always be more than Enough
Your Power is more than Enough
You are all that I have
And all that I want
Oh, it's a Journey
And I cannot Tread it Enough
It's forever, it's New every Morning,
It's New every Morning
Oh Your Love is Amazing
I know that Nothing,
Nothing can Separate me
From you, Nothing,
Nothing can come between us
Na, Na nothing,
Nothing can Separate me from
You For Life
I know that Nothing,
Nothing can Separate me
From you, Nothing,
Nothing can come between us
Na, Na nothing,
Nothing can Separate me from
You For Life
This Joy that You have given me
No one can take it from me
This anointing
You bestowed on me
Is For Life
Oh Your Presence
Will always be more than Enough
Your Power is more than Enough
You are all that I have
And all that I want
Oh, it's a Journey
And I cannot Tread it Enough
It's forever, it's New every Morning,
It's New every Morning
No one can take it away
No no
