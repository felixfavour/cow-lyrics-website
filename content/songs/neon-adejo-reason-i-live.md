You are the reason I live
You are the one for me
The who lives in me
You are the reason I breathe
You are the one for me
You are the life in me
Why should I fear
When I have You
I'm surrounded by Your love
Your everlasting love
Why should I care
What people say
They don't know
Who you are to me
They don't know that I am found in you
