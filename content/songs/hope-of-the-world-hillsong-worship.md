For the love poured out
For the price of freedom
Let the whole earth sing
Hear the praises rising
We stand in awe
Of what You've done for us
At the cross
The hope of the world
Lifted on high
Calling us home
With arms out wide
To know You forever
To love You forever
You are our everything
Our sin erased
We are forgiven
You made a way
You were our ransom
We owe this life
For all You've done for us
At the cross
