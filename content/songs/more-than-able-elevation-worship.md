When did I start to forget
All of the great things You did?
When did I throw away faith for the impossible?
How did I start to believe
You weren't sufficient for me?
Why do I talk myself out of seeing miracles?
[Chorus: Chandler Moore]
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
You are more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
Now I see all that I have
And I've got my confidence back
I'll put my trust in the One who still does 
miracles
You do miracles
[Chorus: Chandler Moore & Tiffany Hudson]
You are more than able
You arе more than able
You are morе than able
You are more than able
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do?
