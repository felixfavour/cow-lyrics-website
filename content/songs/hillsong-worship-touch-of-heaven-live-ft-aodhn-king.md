How I live for the moments
Where I'm still in Your presence
All the noise dies down
Lord, speak to me now
You have all my attention
I will linger and listen
I can't miss a thing
Lord, I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all
All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
oh oh oh oh. oh oh oh oh. oh oh oh oh  oh oh
You're the fire in the morning
You're the cool in the evening
The breath in my soul
Oh, the life in my bones
There is no hesitation
In Your love and affection
It's the sweetest of all
Lord, I know my heart wants more of You
My heart wants something new
So I surrender all
All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'll open up my heart to You
I'll open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now
I'll open up my heart to You
I'll open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now
I'll open up my heart to You
I'll open up my heart to You now
So do what only You can
Jesus, have Your way in me now
All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
All I want is to live within Your love
Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper
Lord, I will open up again
Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven
