I love to worship You my God
I love to worship You my Lord
And see Your Spirit fall in power
Your love unfolding gifts from heaven
I love to worship You my God
I love to worship You my Lord
And feel Your precious breath of heaven
Your all consuming love
Holy Spirit come in power
Change my heart
I want to live for You my God
Let Your Spirit come in power
Change my life
That I may live for You my Lord
Fall on us Lord
[Chorus] 2x
[Bridge] 4x
So I yearn for You
Long to see You move
Oh I lift my hands
Before my King and pray
