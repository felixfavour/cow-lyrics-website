You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
'Cause I'm in love
I cannot remember what I was doing before I met You
I've been captivated
By the love that saved me
And I'm in love
I cannot remember what I was doing before I met You
I've been captivated
By love that saved me, You saved me
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
And I'm in love I cannot remember
What I was doing before I met You
I've been captivated
By love that saved me
And I'm in love I cannot remember
What I was doing before I met You
I've been captivated
By a love that saved me
'Cause You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
And this is why we thank You, this is why we thank You
This is why we thank You, this is why we thank You
This is why we thank You, this is why we thank You
This is why we thank You
And this is why we thank You, this is why we thank You
This is why we thank You, this is why we thank You
This is why we thank You, this is why we thank You
And You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
That You saved me, You saved me
Now I will never leave Your love
