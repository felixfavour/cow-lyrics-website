This city, Lord, it is yours
Pre-Chorus:
So break our hearts, break our hearts
For the people who are far from you
Break our hearts
Chorus:
Teach us to love, the way you loved us
Send us out, send us out
Pour out your fire, and flow through our lives
Send us out, send us out
Verse
Pre-Chorus
Chorus
Bridge:
The heart in my chest, it is beating so fast
I can hardly contain all the hope in my veins
As I see you alive in this city arise
Like the sun shining bright
We see darkness and night run from our lives
Verse Vamp:
This city, Lord, it is yours
