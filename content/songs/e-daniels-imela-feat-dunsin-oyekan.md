Ooh oo
ooo
I'm not here just to sing another song to You
But, I'm here to say
You've been a faithful God and so much more
Lord, I'm here to lay down
All of my trophies at Your feet
For all the miracles you've done for me
I cannot tell it all
Imela, imela
Imela okaka
Imela chineke
Imela Onyeoma
Asher!!
How do I say it, Lord
What do I say?
Where do I start from?
You've been so good to me
When the enemy comes like a flood
Lord, You raise a standard
Above their wills and their plot
Above their plans and their traps
Because they never, never know
How You set me free
They will never never know
How You delivereth me
They will never never know
How You made me escape
They will never never know ooo
Imela, imela
Imela okaka
Imela chineke
Imela Onyeoma
BRIDGE
Jehovah, You are the most high
Jehovah, You are the most high God
Jehovah, You are the most high
Jehovah, You are the most high God
