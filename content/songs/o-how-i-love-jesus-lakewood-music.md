[Intro: 
Israel Houghton
]
There is a name I love to hear
I love to sing its worth
Oh it sounds like music in my ear
The sweetest name
The sweetest name
Everyday with You Lord
Sweeter than the day before
Sweetest name
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Oh how I love Jesus
Because He first loved mе
[Bridge: 
Cindy Cruse Ratcliff
]
We need You, we want You
We need You, wе want You
We need You, we want You
We need You
We live to glorify Your name
