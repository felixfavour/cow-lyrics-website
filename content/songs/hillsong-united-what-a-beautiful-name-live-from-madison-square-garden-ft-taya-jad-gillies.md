Death could not hold You
The veil tore before You
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring
The praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again
You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever, God You reign
Yours is the kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the name above all names
Death could not hold You
The veil tore before You
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring
The praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again
You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever, God You reign
Yours is the kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the name above all names
What a powerful name it is
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus
You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever, God You reign
Yours is the kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the name above all names
You have no rival
You have no equal
Now and forever, God You reign
Yours is the kingdom
Yours is the glory
Yours is the name above all names
What a powerful name it is
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King
What a powerful name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus
What a powerful name it is
The name of Jesus.
