We are a chosen generation
We've been called forth to show His excellence
All I require for life, God has given me
And I know who I am

I know who God says I am
What He says I am
Where He says I'm at
I know who I am

I'm walking in power,
I'm working miracles
I live a life of favour,
For I know who I am

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I know who I am
oh oh oh, I know who I am

I am holy,
I am righteous oh
I am so rich,
I am beautiful

I'm walking in power,
I'm working miracles
I live a life of favour,
For I know who I am

Take a look at me. I'm a wonder
It doesn't matter what you see now
Can you see His glory?
For I know who I am

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I know who I am
