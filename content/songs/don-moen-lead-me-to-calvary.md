King of my life,  I crown thee now,
Thine shall the glory be: Lest I forget thy thorn-crowned brow,
Lead me to Calvary.
Refrain
lest I forget Gethsemane:
lest I forget Thine agony:
lest I forget Thy love for me,
lead me to Calvary.
May I be willing, Lord to bear
Daily my cross for thee:
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.
Refrain
lest I forget Gethsemane:
lest I forget Thine agony:
lest I forget Thy love for me,
Lead me to Calvary
Interlude of Refrain
Refrain (modulation)
lest I forget Gethsemane
lest I forget Thine agony
lest I forget Thy love for me,
lead me to Calvary
Interlude of coda of Refrain
