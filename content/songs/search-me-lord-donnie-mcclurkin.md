Oh, search me, Lord
Come on and search me, Lord
Here's what I want You to do
Shine the light from heaven on my soul
If You find anything that shouldn't be
Take it out and strengthen me
'Cause I wanna be right, I wanna be saved
And I wanna be whole
Oh, search me, Lord
Search me, Lord
Shine the light from heaven on my soul
If You find anything that shouldn't be
Take it out and strengthen me
'Cause I wanna be right, I wanna be saved
And I wanna be whole
While I'm down here praying
Lord, search my heart
While I'm down here praying
Lord, search my heart
While I'm down here praying
Lord, search my heart
Because You know
Whether I'm right or wrong
