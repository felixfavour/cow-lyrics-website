Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
Follow me all my days
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
Yeah, follow me all of the days of my life
Used to believe that I could never ever please Ya
Spent a long time running scared
Couldn't receive that You would never ever leave me
Didn't know that You would call me friend
But now Your grace for me is ever chasing me
No possibility of ever letting go
And You're not mad at me, no You're not mad at me
You're madly in love with me
You love me madly, madly, madly
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
Follow me all my days
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
Yeah, follow me all of the days of my life
With all of my might I sing Your praises so freely
I lift my hands and I lift them high
Open my heart to say that You are so lovely
I worship You as a lifestyle
