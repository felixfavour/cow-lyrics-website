I'll just say yes
You lead the way
I'm not afraid of what it means for me to say
That this life You gave
Is not my own
I'm trusting You to hear my yes and lead me on
Yes Lord
Yes Lord
My life is Yours

I'll just say yes
You lead the way
I'm not afraid of what it means for me to say
This life You gave
Is not my own
I'm trusting You to hear my yes and lead me on

Yes Lord
Yes Lord
My life is Yours
Yes Lord
Yes Lord
My life is Yours

And there is peace when I say yes
I might not see it now
But You save the best
For all who trust You and obey
There is an answer
No more delay

Yes Lord, yes Lord, my life is Yours
Yes Lord, yes Lord, my life is Yours
Yes Lord, yes Lord, my life is Yours
Yes Lord, yes Lord, my life is Yours
Yes Lord, yes Lord, my life is Yours
Yes Lord, yes Lord, my life is Yours
