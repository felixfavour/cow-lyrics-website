You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep, my faith will stand
So we call
And I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine
Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me (Come on, you sing)
You've never failеd (Come on) and You won't start now
So I will call upon Your name, Jesus
And keep my еyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace
For I am Yours (Come on, sing it out)
And You are mine, oh
