GP sing it with me, ah come on  (Hmmm, yeah)
All the young people driving down the street legit  (Hmmm, yeah)
I want you to pump this up so your last door neighbour can hear you  (Hmmm, yeah)
So it's gonna be one time for your Holy man, here we go...
You are the only one who makes me feel this way  (Uhn hun, Uhn hun)
You turn my night to day
Lord I just came to say  (Put your hands together)
I tell you that... You are the only one who came and took me in
You've been that kind of friend
You're the only one... You're the one
I wanna know if I can get all the young people everywhere
From the East Coast to the West Coast
And lift your hands in the air
And praise Him like you just don't care
Can I get in LA and Miami too
New York City and Dallas Texas too, come on and lift those hands and praise Him
I feel an Holy Ghost thing happening
You are the only one who makes me feel this way  (Come on)
You turn my night to day  (Come on)
Lord I just came to say
I tell you that... You are the only one who came and took me in  (He never ever gonna let you down, Jesus)
You've been that kind of friend
You're the only one... You're the one
Former home boys trying to be hot as hell
Put that gun down and put your hands up in the air
I just want to let you know that ain't nobody
member of the devil, give your praise to Jesus cos He's the one that sets you free and free indeed, you understand what I'm saying
So I want everybody and everyplace you go
There's one thing about Jesus I really want you to know
Ain't nobody take you out because He is the Messiah
And the devil, guess what... He's still alive
You are the only one who makes me feel this way  (Yeah... come on now everybody help me praise Him, would you sing it!)
You turn my night to day
Lord I just came to say
I tell you that... You are the only one who came and took me in  (I really love you, really love you)
You've been that kind of friend
You're the only one... You're the one
Praise God...
If you feel him in your hands, Praise God
Because he's coming back again, Praise God
If you feel him in your hands, Praise God
Lift your hands if you love Jesus
Lift up your hands if you really love Jesus
Christian what ya saying we love Jesus
Booyaka, booyaka, booyaka, booyaka boo
Your the one who makes me feel brand new
No other friend can give me joy so true
In my darkest hour I can call on you
You are the one
Your the one who makes me feel brand new
No other friend can give me joy so true
In my darkest hour I can call on you

Say Jesus been good 1 time
If you know I really, really feel Him 2 times
And I know he's coming really back 3 times
If you know that that is just a fact 4 times
If you can lift your hands up high 1 time
If you know the Devil is a liar 2 times
If you know that Jesus is Messiah 3 times
