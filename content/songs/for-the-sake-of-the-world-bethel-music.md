I'm laying down my life, I'm giving up control
I'm never looking back, I surrender all
I'm living for Your glory on the earth
This passion in my heart, this stirring in my soul
To see the nations bow, for all the world to know
I'm living for Your glory on the earth
For the sake of the world burn like a fire in me
Light a flame in my soul for every eye to see
For the sake of the world burn like a fire in me
This passion in my heart, this stirring in my soul
To see the nations bow, for all the world to know
I'm living for Your glory on the earth
For the sake of the world burn like a fire in me
Light a flame in my soul for every eye to see
For the sake of the world burn like a fire in me
For the sake of the world burn like a fire in me
Light a flame in my soul for every eye to see
For the sake of the world burn like a fire in me
Like a fire in me
