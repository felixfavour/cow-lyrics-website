am here for reasons
To brag about my life now
Jehovah God i am yours
I will fear no evil,
My lips will sing a new song
I am yours for i am yours
Where is the power to test you
Who's the god to ask you
Sovereign sovereign
You're the only reason
My life is worth the living
I'll testify
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I have seen your goodness
Heard about your greatness
Jehovah God I am yours
Time and all its seasons
Couldn't fade your glory
You remain you remain
Didn't see the wounded side
Wasn't there on Easter morning
But dear Lord i believe
You are the only reason
My life is worth a living
I'll testify
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
You are holy
You are holy
You are wonderful; to me
You are holy
You are holy
You are wonderful to me
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
