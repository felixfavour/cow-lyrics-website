Come on, just lift up your voices
Just sing out a new song, it’s sittin’ right there
Just lift up your voices, just everything within you
Sing a new song to the Lord, let it rise
Maybe tonight you lift your hands for the first time
There’s freedom here, that anything could happen
The Bible says lift your hands, it’s not an option
It’s not a request, it’s a command
Lift your hands, ooh-oh
Sing out a new song to the Lord
For He’s great and greatly to be praised, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
