I can see the panic in your eyes
And I know you can see it in mine
We've been through some crazy things before
But nothin' like this
You know I've always got a lot to say
But this has left me nothin' but afraid
And I've got one thing I'm holdin' on to
And it's your hand 'cause I believe
Together, we'll get through this
Together, no matter what it is
There's no valley too deep, no river too wide
No mountain too steep we can't climb
Together, we got all we need
Together, just watch and see
We're gonna make it come what may
Nothing can break us if we stay together
I know it's hard to fight an enemy
When the sky is too dark to see
And we can even start to believe
We're fighting with each other
But if we really look deep enough
I believe that we can find the love
And when this storm has finally passed (Finally passed)
We'll see that all we have is what we have
