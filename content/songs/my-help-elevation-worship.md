You tell the ocean
“Here are your boundaries”
You tell the mountain
“You can reach this high”
And when the darkness
Has worn out its welcome
You tell the morning
“Wake up, it’s time to shine”
I know where my help comes from
I know where my help comes from
I lift my eyes up to the hills
Remember who my Father is
I know where my help comes from
God, if You speak it
I can believe it
‘Coz You’re not a man
That You should lie
Nothing is over until You say so
You tell the dead
When it is time to rise
