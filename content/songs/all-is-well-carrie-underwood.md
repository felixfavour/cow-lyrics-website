All is well, all is well
Angels and men rejoice
For tonight darkness fell
Into the dawn of love's light
Sing A-le, sing Alleluia
All is well, all is well
Let there be peace on Earth
Christ has come, go and tell
That He is in the manger
Sing A-le, sing Alleluia
All is well, all is well
Lift up your voice and sing
Born is now Emmanuel
Born is our Lord and Savior
Sing Alleluia, sing Alleluia
All is well
[Outro]
Born is now Emmanuel
Born is our Lord and Savior
Sing Alleluia, sing Alleluia
All is well
