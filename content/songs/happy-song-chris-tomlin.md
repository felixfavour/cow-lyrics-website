(Well) I could sing unending songs
Of how you saved my soul
And I could dance a thousand miles
Because of Your great love
[Bridge]
Come on, everybody dance
Everybody dance
My heart is bursting Lord to
To tell of all You've done
Of how've You changed my life
And wiped away the past
Well, I want to shout it out
From every rooftop sing
For now I know
That God is for me, not against me

[Bridge]
Everybody's singing now
Because we're so happy, yeah
Everybody's dancing now
Because we're so happy
If only I could see Your face
See You smiling over us
And unseen angels celebrate
Hey! The joy is in this place
Yeah, the joy is in this place
