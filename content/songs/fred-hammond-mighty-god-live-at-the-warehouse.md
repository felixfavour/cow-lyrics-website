Oh Lord we come before you
So humble and holy
Now more than ever
We need your spirit to flow
We are your people
And we humble your name
Forgive us our sins
As your healing we claim
Since you will heal us
Feed only praise
Lift up our voices and say
You are the mighty God
And we're calling on you
And we believe by faith
That you will see us through
Oh Lord we need you now
Only you can see
So when I'm done this now
Still give you all the praise
This horrible time
Still say thank you Lord. Thank you Lord
Praise and thanksgiving
On one accord
