Jesus ooh how I love you
your blood on the cross you shed
Jesus, oh how I worship you
cause only you deserve
you deserve it all
you are the reason
reason for life
my whole life depends on you
and I have searched all over
I have gone far and wide
there's no one
because you are the one for me
oh lord, in you I find my self
i'm just floating in your love oh God
I don't know why you love me so
but lord you know I love you too
izuru ka'eme chinekem'o izuru ka'eme
Jesus, Oh how I love you
The perfect sacrifice you become
Jesus, Oh how I love you
cause you are the best thing the best thing the ever happened to me
you are the reason
reason for life
my whole life depends on you
and I have searched all over
I have gone far and wide
there's no one
because you are the one for me
oh lord, in you I find myself
i'm just floating in your love oh God
I don't know why you love me so
but lord you know I love you too
izuru ka'eme chinekem'o izuru ka'eme
