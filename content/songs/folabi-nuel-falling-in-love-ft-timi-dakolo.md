Maybe it's just wishful thinking
But I think I'm falling in love with you...
.....
I'm in love with you baby
i don't know what you've done to me(uhh uhhh uh uhhhh)
I'm in love(uh uhhh uh uhhhhuh)
Baby, the way you dey make my heart dey do tinga tinga ling
Sometimes you dey make me act a fool
it's in the way you move
Darling just me and you
Lately I've been thinking of ways to make you mine
Most days I'm reminded of how you make me smile
This love is for real my baby baby boo
You remind me of that beautiful thing
The finest girl I've ever seen
You remind me of that beautiful thing
You be the only one for me
Maybe it's just wishful thinking
But I think I am falling in love with you
Maybe it's just wishful thinking
But I think I am falling in love with you
Where have you been all my life
Your loving is one of a kind
You take me places that I've never been
You're my perfect lullaby
Oh my oh my finally something to live for
Something wey I go fit die for
This is it, all of it
I don reach where I dey go
This is it, all of it
Love don carry hard guy go
You remind me of that beautiful thing
The finest girl I've ever seen
You remind me of a beautiful thing
You're the only one for me
This is not some wishful thinking
Baby I am falling in love with you
Oh this is not some wishful thinking
Baby I am falling in love with you
I'm in love oh
I'm in love oh
You're my everything
You're a perfect being
In this imperfect world
and I, and I and I love you so
The End.
