Over all the Earth
You reign on high
Every mountain stream
And every sunset sky
But my one request
Lord my only aim
Is that you reign in me again
Lord reign in me
Reign in your power
And over all my dreams
And in my darkest hour
You are the Lord of all I am
So won't you reign in me again
Won't you reign in me
Over every thought
And over every word
May my life reflect
The beauty of my Lord
'Cause you mean more to me
Than any Earthly thing
So won't you reign in me again
Lord reign in me
Reign in your power
And over all my dreams
And in my darkest hour
You are the Lord of all I am
So won't you reign in me again
