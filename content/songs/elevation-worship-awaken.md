Awaken my heart
Awaken my soul
To tell of all You've done
Awaken my heart
Awaken my soul
To sing of Your great love
I lift my cry to You, oh God
Only You can save
I will not fear the darkness here
Where the lions wait
You send from heaven
And You rescue me, rescue me
I will take refuge in the shadow of Your wing
Awaken my heart
Awaken my soul
To tell of all You've done
Awaken my heart
Awaken my soul
To sing of Your great love
I will run hard into Your arms
Lord, You carry me
Despite my pain, Your plan remains
You will deliver me
You send from heaven
And You rescue me, rescue me
I will take refuge in the shadow of Your wing
Awaken my heart
Awaken my soul
To tell of all You've done
Awaken my heart
Awaken my soul
To sing of Your great love
And we will sing
And we will sing
God, You lifted me out
God, You lifted me out
And I'll tell all the world
God, You lifted me out
God, You lifted me out
And I'll tell all the world
God, You lifted me out
God, You lifted me out
And I'll tell all the world
God, You lifted me out
God, You lifted me out
And I'll tell all the world
God, You lifted me out
God, You lifted me out
And I'll tell all the world
God, You lifted me out
God, You lifted me out
And I'll tell all the world
