I have gone through many Tribulations
( ah ya yaya, ah ya yaya,) 
Many storms and many battles
(ah ya ya yaya  yaya)

I have gone through many many trials
( ah ya yaya, ah ya yaya,) 
but you are still with me, Emmanuel. 
(ah ya ya yaya  yaya)

I said I have gone through many Tribulations     ( ah ya yaya, ah ya yaya,) 
Many storms and many battles                           (ah ya ya yaya  yaya)

I have gone through many many fires                 ( ah ya yaya, ah ya yaya,) 
but you are still with me, Emmanuel.                   (ah ya ya yaya  yaya)
