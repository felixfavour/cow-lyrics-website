[Chorus]
Shout to the lord, all the earth
Let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the king;
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of your name
I sing for joy at the work of your hands
Forever i'll love you, forever i'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise i have in you
My jesus, my savior
Lord, there is none like you;
All of my days
I want to praise
The wonders of your mighty love
My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength;
Let every breath, all that i am
Never cease to worship you
Shout to the lord, all the earth
Let us sing
Power and majesty, praise to the king;
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar
At the sound of your name
I sing for joy at the work of your hands
Forever i'll love you, forever i'll stand
Nothing compares to the promise i have in you
