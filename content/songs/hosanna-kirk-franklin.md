The angels bow down at the thought of You
The darkness gives way to the light for You
The price that You paid gives us life brand new
Hosanna forever we worship You
Hosanna forever we worship You
The angels bow down at the thought of You
The darkness gives way to the light for You
The price that You paid gives us life brand new
Hosanna forever we worship You
Hosanna forever we worship You
For You are the joy that my soul longs for
The Lamb that was slain for my sins
And the One I adore
King of kings, ruler of everything
Hosanna forever we worship You
Hosanna forever we worship You
For You are the joy that my soul longs for
The Lamb that was slain for my sins
And the One I adore
King of kings, ruler of everything
Hosanna forever we worship You
Hosanna forever we worship You
