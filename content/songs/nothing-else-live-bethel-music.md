[Chorus]
I'm caught up in Your presence
I just wanna sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never wanna leave
Oh, I'm not here for blessings
Jesus, You don't owe me anything
More than anything that You can do
I just want You
And I'm sorry, when I've just gone through the motions
I'm sorry, when I just sang another song
Take me back to where we started
I open up my heart to You
I'm caught up in Your presence
I just wanna sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never wanna leave
Oh, I'm not herе for blessings
Jesus, You don't owe mе anything
More than anything that You can do
I just want You (Woah, I)
