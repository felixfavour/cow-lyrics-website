What do I have that hasn't been given?
Even the breath I breatheâ€”the mercy of Heaven
All that I have is Your provision
So be still my soul
Be still my soul
Be still and know
Be still, let go
Be still my soul
I remind myself that You are not worried
Even now I sense Your presence around me
I remind myself when my heart is racing
Be still my soul
Be still my soul
Be still and know
Be still, let go
Be still my soul
[Bridge]
All my cares at Your feet
All the fears that cripple me
They bow before the Prince of Peace
You are my peace
All my cares at Your feet
All the fears that cripple me
They bow before the Prince of Peace
You are my peace
