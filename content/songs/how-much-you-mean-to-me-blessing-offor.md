Job got in the way, so I quit that
Lost all my money, didn't miss that
Used to be out late, but I skip that
Your love is the only gift that
Never lets me down, no, no
Never lets me down, no
Your love is the only gift that never lets me down
No song could ever contain it
No one's ever loved me this way
No words could ever explain it
How much You mean to me
Oh, oh, oh
No words could ever explain it
How much You mean to me
Never needed somebody so bad
Evеrything before You was so sad
Want You close to mе, You should know that
Your love is the only hope that
Never lets me down, no, no
Never lets me down, no
Your love is the only hope that
Never lets me down, mm (Whoo!)
