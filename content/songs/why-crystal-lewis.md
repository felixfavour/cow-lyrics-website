My thoughts they overwhelm me
My mind cannot contain
The pain that is within me why
I long for understanding
I live to know the peace
That comes with being sure of something
[Pre-Chorus]
My eyes are blind to your ways oh Lord
Yet I've seen you love and care so
I rest in your knowing
Though I may not know
I take on your strength as though it were my own
Standing on the promises
Your word for me provides
I find therein the answer to the question
Why
My complaint today is bitter but sweet is your reply
My questioning still lingers though Why
You know each road I travel down
My heart and yours are one
I just don't see the good in all things
