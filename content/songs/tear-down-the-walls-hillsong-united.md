Tear down the walls, see the world
Is there something we have missed?
Turn from ourselves, look beyond
There is so much more than this
[Pre-Chorus]
And I don’t need to see it to believe it
I don’t need to see it to believe it
Cause I can’t shake
This fire deep inside my heart
Look to the skies, hope arise
See His majesty revealed
More than this life, there is love
There is hope and this is real
[Pre-Chorus]
And I don’t need to see it to believe it
I don’t need to see it to believe it
Cause I can’t shake
This fire burning deep inside my heart
This life is Yours and hope is rising
As Your glory floods our hearts
Let love tear down these walls
That all creation would
Come back to You
It’s all for You
