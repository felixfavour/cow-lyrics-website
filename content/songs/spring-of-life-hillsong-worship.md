How beautiful are You Lord
A spring of life to me
Words of love caress my soul
You fill my every need
And precious are Your statutes
They guide my every move
I'm so in love with You Lord
Your love shines over me
Chorus:
And I will seek You with all my heart
I will lift my voice to You
No matter how I feel my hope's in You
For You have rescued me from calamity
Set my feet on solid ground
Oh Lord You are a spring of life to me
Your Word secure within me
Has kept my feet from strife
Forever I will thank You
For giving me new life
