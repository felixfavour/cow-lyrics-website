This is our story - Vous Worship
The word
The word became flesh
Traded heaven's glory
Messiah of the mess
He is
Hope and forgiveness
Shepherd of the restless
Heals our brokenness
I surrender all I am to you
God forever I am yours
The wonder of the cross
Holds the power of our peace
The Father's heart revealed on Calvary
Emmanuel forever God with us
The world has never seen a greater love
Life
Given to us
Grace that never ends, oh
Truth that never bends
He is
Light in the darkness
For the lonely and the lost
He will always be enough
For the lonely and the lost
He will always be enough
The wonder of the cross
Holds the power of our peace
The Father's heart revealed on Calvary
Emmanuel forever God with us
The world has never seen a greater love
Oh-ah-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-ah-oh, oh, oh
Oh-ah-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-ah-oh, oh, oh
Sing it out now
This is our story
Sing it out now
This is our reason why
King Jesus our Savior
The way, the truth, the life
Sing it loud now

Sing it loud now
This is our freedom cry
Forever our Savior
The way, the truth, the life
Sing it out now
This is our story
Sing it out now
