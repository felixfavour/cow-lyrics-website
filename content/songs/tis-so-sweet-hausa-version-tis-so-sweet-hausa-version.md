Dogara ga sunan Yesu
('Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,)
Takan sa a sami rai, 
(and to take him at his word;)
Gama ba ceto ga wani
(just to rest upon his promise,)
Ba kuwa hanya sai dai shi.
(and to know, "Thus saith the Lord.")

Yesu, Yesu, ina sonka,
(Jesus, Jesus, how I trust him!)
Kai kadai Mai Ceto ne,
(How I've proved him o'er and o'er!) 
Yesu, Yesu, ni zan bi ka
(Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!) 
Daga nan har abada.
(O for grace to trust him more!)

Jinin Yesu ya fanshe ni,
(O how sweet to trust in Jesus,) 
Yana shafe zunubai
(Just to trust his cleansing blood;) 
Na jingina wurin Yesu,
(and in simple faith to plunge me) 
Ya karbe ni bawansa.
(neath the healing, cleansing flood!)
