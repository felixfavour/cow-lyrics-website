Have traveled around, far and near,
High and low, looked around
On the mountain, in the valley
Across the ocean, across the seas

A o riri, A o gbori 
(Never seen, nor heard before)
Iru yin ko si, akawe yin sâ€™owon 
(No one like you, no comparison to you)  

E ga fio fio fio fio fio 
(You are tall so tall) 
Giga yin oo, ko la fiwe
(Your greatness is incomparable)

OKe nla nla, oke wewe
(Great mountains, smaller mountains) 
Iji lile, ko le duro niwaju re
(Powerful storms cannot stand before you)

Olorun, e ti Tobi to o
(God, you are so great)
E Tobi, Oluwa
(You are great Lord)

All mountains great or small
Strong and fearful storms can never stand
Before you oh my God
How great you are, How great you are

OKe nla nla, oke wewe
(Great mountains, smaller mountains) 
Iji lile, ko le duro niwaju re
(Powerful storms cannot stand before you)

Olorun, e ti Tobi to o
(God, you are so great)
E Tobi, Oluwa
(You are great Lord)
