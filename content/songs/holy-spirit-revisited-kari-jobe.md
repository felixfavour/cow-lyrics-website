There's nothing worth more that will ever come close
Nothing can compare our living hope
Your presence Lord
I've tasted and seen of the sweetest of love
Where my heart becomes free and my shame is undone
Your presence lord
Chorus
Holy spirit you are Welcome here
Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere
Your glory God is what our hearts long for
To be overcome by your presence Lord
Bridge
Let us become more aware of your presence
Let us experience the glory of your goodness
