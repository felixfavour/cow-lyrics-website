Lord, You're leading me
With a cloud by day
And then in the night
The glow of a burning flame
And everywhere I go I see You
And everywhere I go I see You
And You take my hand
And You wash it clean
I know the promised land
Is light years ahead of me
And everywhere I go I see You
And everywhere I go I see You
And everywhere I go I see You
And everywhere I go I see You
And the eagle flies
And the rivers run
I look through the night
And I can see the risin' sun
