From the moment I opened my heart
You gave me Your love from heaven above
King of Glory, Jesus You'll always be mine
Lord I love You, it's all I can say
You amaze me every moment, every day
My creator, Jesus my Lord, always
CHORUS:
From the depths of my heart to the heaven above
There I feel Your embrace and the warmth of Your love
I'm not afraid 'cause Jesus I know You are here
You are here...
You're my Saviour, redeeming grace
Generations will sing of Your praise
Be exalted forever and ever more
Back to CHORUS
*Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise
Great is the Lord, glorified
* ---- repeated
(glorified....)
