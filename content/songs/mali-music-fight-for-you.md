I know they see you and they want you
I know they see you and they want to
Make you who they want you to be
I know that life is tryna to get you
I know that life is calling out to you by your name
But don't listen, resist it
Keep running, don't you stop for nothing
Just keep kicking, remember where you came from
Don't forget what you already know
What you got is amazing, hold that, don't you let it go
You hold the light, you hold the light
You hold the light and it's shining
And making darker places bright and you lighter
You hold the light, you got a lot
You bring a lot, you bring a lot
And it's evident they can see it, they want in it
But it's not for the taking, it's not for the changing
No it's not for remixing, it's not for remaking alright.
So they lining up to take it alright
I can't let them take my you, you know I write for you yeah
I won't let them take you, I won't let them
I won't let them take you, I'll be your protection
I'll be your direction yeah, I'll be your protector
You know I'll rather fight for you, I'll fight for you
I'll fight for you, you knowing I'm fighting
Cause I refuse to lose you (fight for you)
Fighting cause I refuse to lose you (fight for you)
I'll fight you know I'm ready (said I'll fight for you)
Situations will approach you
And opportunities to faith shade and downgrade will provoke you
And those you trust will start to turn too
So never pay too much attention to the things they said they won't do
And you gotta be persistent and believe me you ain't seen much
It's just the beginning
Mark, and slow to speaking but be quick to listen
Be mindful, you be vigilant and pay attention
Because...
You hold the light, you hold the light
You hold the light and it's shining
And making darker places bright and you lighter
You hold the light, you got a lot
You bring a lot, you bring a lot
And it's solid... and they could see it, they want in it
But it's not for the taking, it's not for the changing
No it's not for remixing, it's not for remaking alright.
So they lining up to take it alright
I can't let them take my you, you know I write for you yeah
I won't let them take you, I won't let them
I won't let them take you, I'll be your protection
I'll be your direction yeah, I'll be your protector
You know I'll rather fight for you, I'll fight for you
I'll fight for you, you knowing I'm fighting
Cause I refuse to lose you (fight for you)
Fighting cause I refuse to lose you (fight for you)
I'll fight you know I'm ready (said I'll fight for you)
There's no need to worry bout them 'let me downs'
You can count 'em and stick
The moment you let me round, I torched it
Screen shattered and forced it to move off that groove
It made on the porch in your heart
I knew from the start it was gon' be war
The grounds we're fightin for
The thought of u free from things yeah
Hurt, fear, depression and anger
Confused and rage and pain got all
Got me out here with my twos up
Fighting with what I could use up
Lyrics and tracks with music
Yeah the pain came and the rain fell down
But I maintained through the skirmish
It's cause I love you and you're worth it
Yeah you could be anything to them
But to me you're perfect
I fight for you, I'm right for you
I'm here on purpose.
And you know I'll fight for you, I'll fight for you
I'll fight for you, you knowing I'm fighting
Cause I refuse to lose you (fight for you)
Fighting cause I refuse to lose you (fight for you)
I'll fight you know I'm ready (cause I'll fight for you)
I won't let them take you, I won't let them (fight for you)
I won't let them take you, I'll be your protection (fight for you)
I'll be your direction yeah, I'll be your protector
You know I'll rather fight for you
