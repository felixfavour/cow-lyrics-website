[Instrumental]
If I have You, I have everything
Nothing else compares
If I have You, I have everything
I am satisfied
None like You in the universe
No one else compares
None like You in the universe
Who can stand beside
[Pre-Chorus 1]
You've captured my rebel heart
All that matters is
To love You and be loved by You
All the riches of the world
Cannot compare to You
Let all else fade away
Let all else fade away
Life is found in no other name
Jesus You alone
Life is found in no other name
There's nothing that comes close
