Praise Him sun and moon, praise Him shining stars
All created things made at His command
Governments and kings, nations of the earth
Gather young and old to worship
Let everything that has breath
Shout praise to His name
To the name above all names
Sing glory, hallelujah
Hallelujah to His name
King Jesus, Jesus be praised
Underneath our feet there's a shaking
As the church awakes to it's calling
Hope is rising strong, freedom's coming
Heaven and earth unite in worship
Let everything that has breath
Shout praise to His name
To the name above all names
Sing glory, hallelujah
Hallelujah to His name
King Jesus, Jesus be praised
What you want, what you know
We've got to make His kingdom grow
What you want, what you know
We've got to make His kingdom grow
