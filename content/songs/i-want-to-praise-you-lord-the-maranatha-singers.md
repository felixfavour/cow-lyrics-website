Praise You Lord praise You Lord
Praise You Lord praise You Lord
I want to praise (know, love, serve) You Lord
Much more than I do
I want to praise (know, love, serve) You lord
Much more than I do
Learn to seek Your face
And the knowledge of Your grace
I want to praise (know, love, serve) You
Birds in the sky sing their songs to You
Trees in the fields lift their arms to You
I want to sing I want to lift my arms to You
