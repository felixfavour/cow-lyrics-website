[Intro]
'Cause all I want is you
All I crave is you
I will run the race set before me
I will seek your face as the prize of my life
I will run the race set before me
I will seek your face as the prize of my life
[Vamp]
I will run (I will run)
I will run (I will run)
I will run (I will run)
I will run (I will run)
I will run (I will run)
I will run (I will run)
I will run (I will run)
All I want is you
All I crave is you
All I want is you
All I crave is you
All I want is you
All I crave is you
