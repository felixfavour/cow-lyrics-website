More than my eyes can see
More than my ears can hear
More than my heart can feel
More than my hands can touch
More than my lungs can breath
More than my urgent needs
More than my mouth can speak
More than my mind can conceive
That's how big my God is
That's how big my God is
More than my strongest foe
He's in every place I go
He's more than luck or draw
He knows my every thought
With Him, nothing's old or new
He watches everything I do
Not contained by space or time
More than my words can define
That's how big my God is
That's how big my God is
He's more than our eyes can see
More than our ears can hear
More than our hearts can feel
More than our hands can touch
More than our lungs can breath
More than our urgent needs
More than our mouths can speak
More than our minds can conceive
