"This Is Living"
(feat. LeCrae)
Waking up knowing there's a reason
All my dreams come alive
Life is for living with You
I've made my decision
You lift me up, fill my eyes with wonder
Forever young in Your love
This freedom's untainted with You
No moment is wasted
See the sun now bursting through the clouds
Black and white turns to colour all around
All is new, in the Savior I am found
This is living now
This is living now
You lead the way, God You're right beside me
In Your love I'm complete
There's nothing like living with You
This life You created, I choose
See the sun now bursting through the clouds
Black and white turn to color all around
All is new, in the Savior I am found
This is living now
This is living now
You take me higher than I've been before
It's Your perfect love that sees me soar
God your freedom is an open door
You are everything I want and more
Maybe I ain't really know what livin' is
Is it love, if it was, am I livin' it?
Do I live in it? (yeah) So astounding
Love is an ocean, you can drown me
The sweet embrace, the lovely taste, I taste and see I'm under grace, the place to be
It means I'll never need an umbrella
I'm cool in the cold and the hot weather
Whether or never I ever, understand I'm a man in the hands of great plans
I stand with faith in a life I never known or touched, it's still outside my clutch but
I'm like what's to dream of? What's to hope in? What's to die for? Live to no end
This is living, the life I've been given's a gift
If I'mma live it, I'mma live it to death
So what's to dream of? What's to hope in? What's to die for? And live to no end
This is living, the life I've been given's a gift
If I'mma live it, I'mma live it to death
This is living now
This is living now
You take me higher than I've been before
It's Your perfect love that sees me soar
God your freedom is an open door
You are everything I want and more
