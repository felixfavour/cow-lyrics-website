A thousand generations falling down in worship
To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
And all who've gone before us and all who will believe
Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb

Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your name stands above them all

And the angels cry, holy
All creation cries, holy
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever

If you've been forgiven and if you've been redeemed
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
Sing the song forever and amen

And all the angels cry, holy
All creation cries, holy
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever
Hear your people sing, holy
To the King of kings, holy
And You will always be, holy
Holy forever

Oh, 'cause Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name stands above them all
Above all thrones and dominions
And all powers and positions
Your name stands above them all

Oh, Jesus, Your name is the highest
Your name is the greatest
Your name, oh, it stands above them all
Above all thrones and dominions
And all powers and positions
Your name, oh, it stands above them all

And the angels cry, holy
And all creation cries, holy
You are lifted high, holy
Holy forever, ayy
Hear your people sing, holy
And to the King of kings, holy
And You will always be, holy
Holy forever

You will always be, holy
Holy forever
