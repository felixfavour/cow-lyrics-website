We will seek Your face, Almighty God
Turn and pray for You to heal our land
Father, let revival start in us
Then every heart will know Your Kingdom come
Lifting up the name of the Lord
In power and in unity
We will see the nations turn
Touching Heaven, changing earth
Lifting up the name of the Lord
In power and in unity
We will see the nations turn
Touching Heaven, changing earth
Touching Heaven, changing earth
Never looking back, we'll run the race
Giving You our lives, we'll gain the prize
We will take the harvest given to us
Though we sow in tears, we'll reap in joy
Lifting up the name of the Lord
In power and in unity
We will see the nations turn
Touching Heaven, changing earth
