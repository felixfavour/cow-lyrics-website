I won't forget, the wonder of how You brought
Deliverance, the exodus of my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
You found me, You freed me
Held back the waters for my release
Oh 
Yahweh
'Cause You're the God who fights for me
Lord of every victory
Hallelujah, hallelujah
You have torn apart the sea
You have led me through the deep
Hallelujah, hallelujah
A cloud by day, is a sign that You are with me
The fire by night, is a guiding light to my feet
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause You found me, You freed me
Held back the waters for my release
Oh Yahweh
