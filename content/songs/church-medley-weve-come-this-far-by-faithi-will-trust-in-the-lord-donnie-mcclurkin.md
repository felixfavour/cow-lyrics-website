You know we've come this far by faith
Leaning on the Lord
Trusting in His holy word
He never fail me yet
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
No turning around
We've come this far by faith
Repeat I will trust in the Lord (x3)
Till I die
I will trust in the Lord (x3)
Till I die
I'm gonna stay on the battle field (x3)
Till I die
I'm gonna stay on the battle field (x3)
Till I die
I'm gonna treat everybody right (x3)
Till I die
I'm gonna treat everybody right (x3)
Till I die
