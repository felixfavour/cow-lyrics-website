There's no other God onto our god
For the scriptures declare that
The lord our God is a great god
David said in his hands are the 3 places of the earth
The sea is his and he made it
And his hands form the dry land
Great is our god
Great is our God
Great is our God
Great is our God
My Saviour
Great is our God
Great is our God
Great is our God
Great is our God
My Saviour
Great is our God
Awesome in all of your ways
He gives his grace and strength
All that is good and true
Comes from the Lord
Who makes all things new
