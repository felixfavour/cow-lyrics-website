Well, I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now. I'm gonna make it to heaven somehow. Though the devil tempts me and tries to turn me around
He's offered everything that's got a name. All the wealth I want and worldly fame. If I could still I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now.

Well, I started out travelin' for the Lord many years ago. I've had a lot of heartaches met a lot of grief and woe
And when I would stumble then I would humble down. And there I would say thank the Lord. I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.

Well, I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now. I'm gonna make it to heaven somehow. Though the devil tempts me and tries to turn me around
He's offered everything that's got a name. All the wealth I want and worldly fame. If I could still I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now.

There's nothing in the world that'll ever take the place of God's love. All the silver and gold could never buy a mighty touch from above. When my soul needs a healin' and I being to feelin' his power. I can say thank the Lord I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.

Well, I wouldn't take nothing for my journey now. I'm gonna make it to heaven somehow. Though the devil tempts me and tries to turn me around
He's offered everything that's got a name. All the wealth I want and worldly fame. If I could still I wouldn't take nothin' for my journey now.
