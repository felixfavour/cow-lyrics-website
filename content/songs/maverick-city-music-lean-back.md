You will never leave
Your love Jesustaining me
Before I even knew
What love was
You've brought me here to rest
And given me space to breathe
So I'll stay still until
It sinks in
And I will lean back in the loving arms
Of a beautiful Father
Breathe deep and know that He is good
He's a love like no other
You will never leave
Your love Jesustaining me
Before I even knew
What love was
You've brought me here to rest
And given me space to breathe
So I'll stand still until
It sinks in
And I will lean back in the loving arms
Of a beautiful Father (It's who You are, who You are)
Breathe deep and know that He is good
He's a love like no other
I will lean back in the loving arms
Of my beautiful Father (It's who You are, who You are)
Breathe deep and know that He is good
He's a love like no other
And now I can see Your love is better
Than all the others that I've seen
I'm breathing deep, of all Your goodness
Your loving-kindness to me
Now I can see Your love is better
Than all the others that I've seen
And I'm breathing deep, of all Your goodness
Your loving-kindness to me
Now I can see Your love is better
Than all the others that I've seen
I'm breathing deep, of all Your goodness
Your loving-kindness to me
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
I'm breathing, I'm breathing
Thought I knew what love was
Thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
But it's so much better, it's better
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
But it's better, it's better
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
But it's brighter, it's brighter
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
But it's better, it's better
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
Oh, it turns out it's better, it's better
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
It's better, it's better
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
But it's brighter, it's brighter
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
I thought I knew what love was
It's better, it's better
It's better, it's better
Better than I thought, better than I dreamed
It's better, it's better
It's better, it's better
It's better, it's better
It's better, it's better, it's better
It's better, it's better
This love is patient
This love is kind
It's always present, so much better
This love is patient
This love is kind
It's always present and it's better, it's better
Never knew a love like this
Never knew a love like this
Never knew a love like this
It's better, it's better (It's better, it's better)
I never knew a love like this
I never knew a love like this
I never knew a love like this
It's better, it's better (It's better, it's better)
I never knew a love like this
I never knew a love like this
I never knew a love like this
It's better, it's better (It's better, it's better)
Yes, it's better, it's better (It's better, it's better)
So much better (It's better, it's better)
It's better, it's better (It's better, it's better)
It's better, it's better (It's better, it's better)
And now I can see Your love is better
