Your presence is heaven

Who is like You Lord in all the earth?
Matchless love and beauty, endless worth
Nothing in this world can satisfy
'Cause Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh God, Your presence is heaven to me
You are the treasure of my heart
Treasure of my heart and of my soul
In my weakness you are merciful
Redeemer of my past and present wrongs
Holder of my future days to come
Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me
God, Your presence is heaven to me
There's nothing like Your presence
Your presence is heaven to me
So we sing
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Your presence is heaven to me
