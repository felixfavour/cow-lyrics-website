[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Every man, woman, every boy and girl
Just for a minute, I want you to stop what you're doing
Hallelujah
Jesus, You are my joy within
You are the shelter from the wind
You're the forgiver of my sins
(
Hallelujah
)
Jesus, You are, yes
Where can I go? Who can I call?
Who's there to catch me when I fall?
Your hands, they hold me through it all
Everything I need You are
[Interlude: Kirk Franklin]
I'm so unworthy, I'm so unworthy
Hallelujah
Jesus, You are my cornerstone
(
Hallelujah
)
You are my friend when I'm alone
You're the convictor when I'm wrong
(
Yes, Jesus
)
Jesus, You are, yes
You are the peace within my storm
You are the shelter from all harm
I love it when You hold me in Your arms
Everything I need You are
