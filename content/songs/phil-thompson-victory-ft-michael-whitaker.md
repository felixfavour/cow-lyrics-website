"Victory"
(feat. Michael Whitaker)
My enemies, they surround me
But You gave me victory
So, I'll call You Victory
I'll will march these walls until they fall
Cause You gave me victory
So, I'll call You Victory
All glory, all honor
All power belongs to You
Our God, He reigns
Victorious, Victorious
Our God, He reigns
Victorious, Victorious
My enemies, they surround me
But You gave me victory
So, I'll call You Victory
I'll will march these walls until they fall
Cause You gave me victory
So, I'll call You Victory
All glory, all honor
All power belongs to You
All glory, all honor
All power belongs to You
Our God, You reign
Victorious, Victorious
Our God, You reign
Victorious, Victorious
So, why should I worry?
Why should I ever be afraid
When Your grace and
Your mercy surrounds me?
So, why should I worry?
Why should I ever be afraid
When Your grace and
Your mercy surrounds me?
Our God, You reign
Victorious, Victorious
Our God, You reign
Victorious, Victorious
Our God, You reign
Victorious, Victorious
Our God, You reign
Victorious, Victorious
Victorious, Victorious
Victorious, Victorious
