Today we celebrate our risen Savior
We're grateful for all You are and all You've done, Father
So right now, we lift up our hands, we lift up our voices
And we declare that every praise belongs to You, we sing
Every praise is to our God
Every word of worship, with one accord
Every praise, every praise
Is to our God
Every praise is to our God
Every word of worship, with one accord
Every praise, every praise
Is to our God
Every praise is to our God
Every word of worship, with one accord
Every praise, every praise
Is to our God
Every praise is to our God
Every word of worship, with one accord
Every praise, every praise
Is to our God
