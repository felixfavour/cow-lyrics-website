Down at Your feet, oh Lord
Is the most high place
In Your presence, Lord
I seek your face, seek your face

There is no higher calling, no greater honor
Then to bow and kneel before Your throne
I am amazed at Your glory, embraced by Your mercy
Oh Lord, I live to worship You

Oh-oh-oh
Down at Your feet, oh Lord
Is the most high place
In Your presence, Lord
We seek Your face

There is no higher calling (higher calling), no greater honor
Then to bow and kneel before Your throne
I am amazed at Your glory, embraced by Your mercy
Oh Lord, I live to worship You
