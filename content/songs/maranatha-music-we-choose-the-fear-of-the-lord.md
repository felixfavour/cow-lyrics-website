We choose the fear of the Lord
We choose the fear of the Lord
For the fear of the Lord is to hate all evil
We choose the fear of the Lord
We choose the fear of the Lord
We choose the way of the Lord
We choose the way of the Lord
For the way of the Lord is the way of wisdom
We choose the way of the Lord
We choose the way of the Lord
He who delights in the Word of the Lord
Shall be blessed in all of his ways
For the friendship of God is with those who fear Him
So we choose the fear of the Lord
We choose the Way of the Lord
We choose the Word of the Lord
We choose the Word of the Lord
We choose the Word of the Lord
For the Word of the Lord shall endure forever
We choose the Word of the Lord
We choose the Word of the Lord
For the fear of the Lord is to hate all evil
We choose the fear of the Lord
We choose the way of the Lord
We choose the Word of the Lord
