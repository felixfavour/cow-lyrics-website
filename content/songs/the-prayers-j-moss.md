You know what
I been lookin' for somebody
Not just anybody
But a special somebody, c'mon!
Can anybody out there pray for me?
Without even knowin' what I need
Can anybody pray for me
The prayers of the Righteous
Can anybody out there pray for me?
Without even knowin' a whole lot about me?
Can anybody pray where the prayers don't cease
The prayers of the Righteous
Do do do do da dup da do do, da da da dup dup da do do, lemme hear ya say!
Do do do do da dup da do do, da da da dup dup da do do
I wanna hear you say it!
Can anybody out there pray for me?
Without even knowin' what I need
Can anybody pray unselfishly?
The prayers of the Righteous
Can anybody out there pray for me?
Without even knowin' a whole lot about me
Can anybody pray where the prayers don't cease?
The prayers of the Righteous
