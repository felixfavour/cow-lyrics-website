I know You see us
I know you hear us
And You fill us when we pray
You understand us, See deep inside us
Translate tears and take them away
I'm a be honest, There are times
Your ways and method's, I don't understand
You seems so far, Tell me who You are
I know your touch, but can't see Your plan
I'm lost in this thing called life
Left to me now feels right
It's Your turn now, I wanna be where you are
Hide me
Let me live behind You
Cause I need
Shelter from the rain
Remind me
The only way my faith can grow
Is when You let Your winds blow
You're making me stronger now, so rain
Don't go away
Don't go away
I'd admit, It'd be nice
To have some light shine down on me
Especially When, Lord I shall be
You don't always let me see
It ain't easy
But I'm trying hard to get out of Your way
To believe, That what You say
That my change begins today
The road includes some pain
And to grow you need some rain
And when it falls, I wanna be where You are
