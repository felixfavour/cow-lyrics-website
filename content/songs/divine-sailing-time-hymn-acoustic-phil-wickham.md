[Divine]
The fullness of Your grace is here with me
The richness of Your beauty's all I see
The brightness of Your glory has arrived
In Your presence God, Iâ€™m completely satisfied
For You I sing I dance
I rejoice in this divine romance
Lift my heart and my hands
To show my love, to show my love
A deep, deep flood
An ocean flows from You
Of deep, deep love
Yeah it's filling up the room
Your innocent blood, has washed my guilty life
In Your presence God, I'm completely satisfied
For You I sing I dance
I rejoice in this divine romance
Lift my heart and my hands
To show my love, to show my love
