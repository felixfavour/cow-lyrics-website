There is a feeling I get when I pray*
And when I worship you Lord
A Feeling that comes over me
A Presence that takes over me
It's so amazing I'll just lift my hands
It's so amazing I'll just lift my hands (2x)
[Leader (2x):]
Blessed adoration with great anticipation I surrender my all to you
[Vamp:]
I lift my hands totally surrendering to you
I lift my hands giving all I have everything I am to you
[Repeat with Harmony]
[Ride Out:]
I lift my hands my hands
As a sign of surrender
Totally to you
