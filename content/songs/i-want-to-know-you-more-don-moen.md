One thing have i desired
Forever will I see
To behold the beauty of His holy name
And to dwell within the presence of the King
How could I ask for more
He's done so much for me
For I have tasted of the goodness of the Lord
And I've feasted at the table of the King
I just want to know Him more
I just want to know Him more
I just want to know Him more
I just want to know Him more
You've called me by Your name
And You've filled me with your love
You have covered with mercy and with grace
And have showered me with blessings from above
And yet i know there's more
I hear You calling me
To a place where i have never been before
Where Your love is flowing
Deeper than the sea
I just want to know Him more
I just want to know Him more
I just want to know You more
I just want to know You more
