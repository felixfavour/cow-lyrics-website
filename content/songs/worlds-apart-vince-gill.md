There's nothing quite as lonely as a sky that turns to gray
Or a love that just starts dyin' and slowly fades away
You we're my best companion, now we lie silent in the dark
Why do you and me have to be worlds apart?
There's nothing quite as empty as when children go away
And all that's left are memories of all those yesterdays
You can't understand the feeling 'til it finds its way to your heart
Why do you and me have to be worlds apart?
There's nothing quite as ugly as two people full of hate
We'll all end up as equals when we stand at Heaven's gate
Love is still the answer, it's the only place to start
Why do you and me have to be worlds apart?
Oh, love is still the answer, it's the only place to start
Why do you and me have to be worlds apart?
