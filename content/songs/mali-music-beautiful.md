It's a blessing to see people
With their heads up to the sky still
'Cause honestly for the same people
Life can be so real
I'm amazed by all your strength, I am
And I'm grateful you come through yeah, yeah
So I take this time to stop a moment
And show my gratitude
For you I
I put my lighter in the air for you
I see whatch'u doing, yeah I see whatch'u go through
Put my lighter in the air, the truth is you're beautiful, beautiful
Now put your lighter in the air for us,
Everybody singin' together, sing a new song
Put your lighter in the air for love is beautiful, beautiful
Many mighty ships are sinking
Many stars are falling down
And I count it as a blessing
That you hold me up now
I can tell that you've been praying
My whole life has turned around, yeah yeah
And I can't go without saying
That I thank God for you all now
Eh, for you I
I put my lighter in the air for you
I see whatch'u doing, yeah I see whatch'u go through
Put my lighter in the air, the truth is you're beautiful, beautiful
Now put your lighter in the air for us,
Everybody singin' together, sing a new song
Put your lighter in the air for love is beautiful, beautiful
Let me hear you say yaa yaa yaa yaa, yaa yaa yaa
(yaa yaa yaa yaa, yaa yaa yaa)
Say yaa yaa yaa yaa, yaa yaa yaa
(yaa yaa yaa yaa, yaa yaa yaa)
Let me hear you say yaa yaa yaa yaa, yaa yaa yaa
(yaa yaa yaa yaa, yaa yaa yaa)
Say yaa yaa yaa yaa, yaa yaa yaa
(yaa yaa yaa yaa, yaa yaa yaa)
I put my lighter in the air for you
I see whatch'u doing, yeah I see whatch'u go through
Put my lighter in the air, the truth is you're beautiful, beautiful
Now put your lighter in the air for us,
Everybody singin' together, sing a new song
Put your lighter in the air for love is beautiful, beautiful
Let me hear you say yaa yaa yaa yaa, yaa yaa yaa
