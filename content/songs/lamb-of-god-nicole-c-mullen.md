Once upon a long night, after a hard ride, somewhere in Bethlehem
A baby breaks the silence sweetly he's crying I AM EMMANUEL
Then angels gave him music
Shepherds gave reverence and a message to the land
A widow held and cherished the God who became a man
Oh Lamb of God
Oh Prince of Peace
What tribute shall I bring to worship thee?
I have no gold to lay at your feet
So Lamb of God I offer me
Can you see the wise men?
A star did guide them searching all the earth
Till they found the one child the very Godchild who ruled the universe
Did they know the lady's little baby was God and fully man
And everything they gave him he himself had made with his hands?
Oh Lamb of God
Oh Prince of Peace
What tribute shall I bring to worship thee?
I have no gold to lay at your feet
So Lamb of God I offer me
