The King is in the room
Come see the scars of love upon His hands
The King is in the room
We'll watch the darkness flee at His command
[Pre-Chorus]
Who is this King?
Who is this King?
His name is Jesus
His name is Jesus
Light of the world
There's freedom in His name
Awesome in power
Reigning forever
Light of the world
There's freedom in His name
The Healer's in the room
Let miracles break out across this place
Oh-oh
The Savior's in the room
And no soul beyond the boundaries of His grace
And thеre's resurrection powеr in His name
