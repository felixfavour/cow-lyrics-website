My strength, my strength
O the joy of the Lord is
My strength, my strength
O the joy of the Lord is
{Pre-Chorus]
My strength that is enough
to overcome the world
You're the joy no one can take away
You're the joy no one can take away
You're the peace inside I can't explain
You're the strength I need, You will always be
[Bridge]
Stronger, stronger
I'm getting stronger
The joy of the Lord
It makes me stronger
Greater, greater
My God is greater
His power, His power
It makes me stronger
