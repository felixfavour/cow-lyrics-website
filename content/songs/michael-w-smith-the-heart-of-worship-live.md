When the music fades
And all is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless your heart
Pre-chorus
I'll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart
Chorus
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about you
It's all about you, Jesus
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it
It's all about you, it's all about you Jesus
Verse 2
King of endless worth
No one could express,
How much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is yours
Every single breath
I'll bring you more than a song
For a song in itself is not what you have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's about you, it's all about you Jesus
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it
It's all about you, it's all about you Jesus
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's about you, it's all about you Jesus
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it
It's all about you, it's all about you Jesus
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's about you, it's all about you Jesus
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it
It's all about you, it's all about you Jesus.
