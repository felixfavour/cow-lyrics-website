Instrumental Intro]
[Spoken]
It's too early for all this
Listen, ya'll know that I'm kind of an observant person
I find revelation in everything
If you go to an amusement park, look at the rollercoasters
There are two types of rollercoaster riders
There's one like me, who's very quiet
Holds on to the bar real tight
And then you have another one
They just throw up their hands and scream, "AHH"
The weird part about it is me
Who's sitting there, tryin' to be all cool about it
And I'm holding everything in
I'm feeling all those drops more than the people that have their hands up shouting
And it just seems like in this season
It just seems like God is purposely putting me through a little bit of rollercoaster action
Some rises and some falls
Just to see if for once, I would just "AHH"
Jesus, Jesus
I can't do this by myself

There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every cycle, to break all these cycles
To break all these (cycles)
To end all these (cycles)
Do away with these (cycles)
Help me end these (cycles)
Work on me, Jesus (cycles
Work on me, Jesus (cycles)
Work on me, Jesus (cycles)
Work on me, God (cycles)
Work on me, God (cycles, cycles
