Hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now
I'll be the one
When the morning comes
Calling out for you
To my rendezvous
I will be the one
(The light of the world)
Yeah I'll be the one
(The bright and morning star)
Said I'll be the one
(Fairest of ten thousand)
Yeah I'll be the, one, two, three, one, two, three
I'll be the one
(When your heart is aching)
When the day is done
(You think one the else is there)
Watching over you
(Darkness all around you)
And everything you do
(The pain is too much to bear)
I will be the one
The light of the world
Yeah I'll be the one
The bright and morning star
Said I'll be the one
Fairest of ten thousand
Yeah I'll be the, one, two, three, one, two, three
