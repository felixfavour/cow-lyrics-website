i know ya thinking... you're the only one
i see you hiding out 'cause of what you've done
all your shame got you on the run
i been there, too, and it just ain't fun
this is a message to the saints
the table has been set, so take your place
there is no more condemnation
there is only grace
we are family here
colors and stains disappear
there is no doubt you belong
this is the family of God
no matter who you were when you walked through the door
here you're no orphan anymore
brothers and sisters by blood
this is the family of God
oh, we are
sons and daughters of the king
we are
we are the royal family
hey drifter, you can come on home
you're no stranger, yeah, you are known
heavy burdens, leave 'em at the door
'cause this is our father's world
for this is our father's world
This is a message to the saints
The table has been set, so take your place
There is no more condemnation
There is only grace
So, child of God
Your adoption, it is done
This family is forever
And we've just begun
