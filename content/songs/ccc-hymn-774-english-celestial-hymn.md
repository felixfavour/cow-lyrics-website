1: Holy is Lord Jesus Christ,
Hearken unto us we pray,
Whenever we draw near Thee
O hears us – Jehovah.

2: Jesus – King of shining light,
Kindle thy light in our hearts,
Thou art King and Redeemer,
O hears us Jehovah.

3: Jesu friend of all sinners,
Forgive us our sins we pray
Thou art King and Redeemer,
Forgive us all we pray. Amen
