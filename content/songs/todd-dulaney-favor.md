All rise and give the lord Glory in this place
Yeah Hallelujah Oh my mighty God Yeah
Oh Lord let Your Favor fall down
Oh Lord, let Your favor fall down
Cause we need a shower of privilege, from the Holy One above
Oh Lord, let Your favor fall down
Oh Lord, let Your favor fall down
Oh Lord, let Your favor fall down
We need Your shower of privilege from the Holy One above
Oh Lord, let Your favor fall down
Let Your favor fall down
Because Master in your face is where your favor lies
So please don't turn away from me
And don't you leave my side
We need a shower of privilege from the Holy One above
Oh Lord, let Your favor fall on us now
Master in your face is where your favor lies
So don't turn away from me
And don't you leave my side
We need a shower of privilege from the Holy One above
Oh Lord, let Your favor fall, favor fall down
Let Your favor fall down
(AD-LIB)
I'm favored, I'm favored
I'm favored, I'm favored
I'm favored, I'm favored
I'm favored, I'm favored
