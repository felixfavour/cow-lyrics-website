Exalt the Lord our God
Worship at His feet
We bring our highest praises to You
We seek the Holy One
Day and night we cry
Holy holy holy is the Lord
Chorus:
For the Lord is good
And His mercy endures forever
For the Lord is good
And His love endures al - ways
Rise before the King
Bless the risen Lord
Let the song of nations be Your praise
