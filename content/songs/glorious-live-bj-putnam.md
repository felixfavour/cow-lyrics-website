[Chorus]
Glorious, shout it out and
Glorious, make it louder
Jesus, we shout Your name
Jesus, we make Your praise
Glorious, You are glorious
God, You are glorious
My God You reign, forever and ever
How great Your name
Your love remains, forever and ever
You stay the same
[Pre-Chorus]
Shout it out, shout it out, if you know He's good
Sing it out, sing it out, for the Lord is good
Shout it out loud, You are glorious
Glorious, shout it out and
Glorious, make it louder
Jesus, we shout Your name
Jesus, we make Your praise
Glorious, You are glorious
