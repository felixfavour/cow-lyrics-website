Lie number 1, you're supposed to have it all together. And when they ask "how you doing?", just smile and tell 'em "never better".
Lie number 2, everybody's life is perfect except yours. So keep your messes and your wounds and your secret's safe with you behind closed doors.
But truth be told, the truth is rarely told.
I say "I'm fine, yeah I'm fine, oh I'm fine. Hey, I'm fine" but I'm not, I'm broken.
And when it's out of control, I say it's under control but it not and you know it.
I don't know why it's so hard to admit it when being honest is the only way to fix it.
There's no failure, no fall. There's no sin, You don't already know so let the truth be told.
There's a sign on the door, that says " come as you are" but I doubt it. Cos if we live like that was true  every Sunday morning pew will be crowded. But didn't You say church should look more like a hospital. A safe place for the sick, the sinner and the scarred and the prodigal, like me.
But truth be told, the truth is rarely told.
Oh am I the only one who says " I'm fine, yeah I'm fine, oh I'm fine, hey I'm fine"?  but I'm not
I'm broken. And when it's out of control, I say it's under control but it's not and you know  it.
I don't know why it's so hard to admit it. When being honest is the only way to fix it.
There's no failure, no fall. There's no sin you don't already know.
 So let the truth be told.
Can I really stand here unashamed knowing that Your love for me won't change.
Oh God if that's really true, then let the truth be told.
I say I'm fine, yeah I'm fine, oh I'm fine, hey I'm fine but I'm not; I'm broken.
And when its out of control, I say it's under control but it's not and you know it
I dunno why it's so hard to admit it, when being honest is the only way to fix it. There's no failure, no fall. There's no sin you don't already know. Yeah I know
There's no failure, no fall, there's no sin You don't already know so let the truth be told.
