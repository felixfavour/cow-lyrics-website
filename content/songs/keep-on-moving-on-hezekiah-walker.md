Be not weary (be not weary)
In well doing (in well doing).
Know that in time (in time)
It will come to pass.
Set your eyes (set your eyes on things above)
And know that God (know that God is working on your behalf x2
Well, He may not come when you want Him but you gotta hold on (hold on)
For all things work together for those who love the Lord.
Dont you be move by the snares of the enemy you gotta hold on (hold on)
When your backs up against the wall
That's when you gotta keep on keeping on
(chorus)
For God is not a man that he should lie
Never far away , he's standing by
(i want you to know that) God is not a man that he should lie
Hold on , hold on
Clap your hands everybody
Everybody just clap your hand
And say 'oh yeah' (oh yeah)
(come on in this place)Clap your hands everybody
Everybody just clap your hand
And say oh yeah (oh yeah)
