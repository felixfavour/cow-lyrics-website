Light in my darkness
You step into my world you illuminate it
Expose my brokenness you restore me
You give me a life that is worth living for
Worth dying for
Perfect morning star
Your mercy new and fresh with every sunrise
Awake me from my slumber you give me new eyes
Mesmerized by perfect love at first sight
And my heart cries
To know you dear God is
Heaven on earth
Heaven on earth
Heaven heaven on earth
To have you here God is
Heaven on earth
Oh oh oh
To know you dear God is
Heaven on earth
Heaven on earth
Heaven heaven on earth
To have you here God is
Heaven on earth
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh ageless One
The Word that spoke the world into existence
Beyond its death You'll reign in all of Your brilliance
Your throne is my horizon
Your kingdom come your will done
You've quenched my wanderlust
Ah patiently, I will wait on this side of eternity
You're preparing a place where eternally
I'll sing holy holy
So i'll just right now
To know you dear God is
Heaven on earth
Heaven on earth
Heaven heaven on earth
To have you here God is
Heaven on earth
Yeah
To know you dear God is
Heaven on earth
Heaven on earth
Heaven heaven on earth
To have you here God is
Heaven on earth
Yeah
They can have it all but give me
You you
Nothing else will do do
I have what is true true
I have Jesus
They can have it all but give me
You you
Nothing else will do do
I have what is true true
I have Jesus
To know you dear God is
Heaven on earth
Heaven on earth
Heaven heaven on earth
To have you here God is
Heaven on earth
