O come, O Come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear

Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer
Our spirits by thine advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight

O come, Thou Key of David, come
And open wide our Heavenly home
Make safe the way that leads on high
And close the path of misery

Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel
