Come let us see our Lord and King
Heâ€™s reigning in glory
Lift up your eyes, all earth and skies
His kingdom is coming
[Pre-Chorus]
From glory to glory
We will arrive
We will ascend the hill of the Lord
We will declare His holy word
With clean hands and pure hearts
With clean hands and pure hearts
We will see God
We fix our eyes, we give our lives
Our hope is in Heaven
So let us run, we have overcome
Now and forever
[Pre-Chorus]
From glory to glory
We will arrive
