I need words, deeper than the ocean
And I need a voice, that's bigger than the sky
And I need a song, that's worthy of Your nail scars
To sing of love, that took a chance onâme

'Causeâthisâis more thanâI could askâfor and more than I could dream
The One who made the world somehow thinks the world of me
The highest King of Heaven chose to love a fool
I don't understand it, but I know I want nothing more than You
And I thought God, was further than horizons
And I thought grace, was just beyond my reach
But You said my life, was worthy of Your nail scars
So I'll sing like it was, 'cause You took a chance on me

Now this is more than I could ask for, more than I could dream
The One who made the world somehow thinks the world of me
The highest King of Heaven chose to love a fool
I don't understand it, but I know I want nothing more than You
Nothing more than You
[Bridge]
When I was at my lowest, You still were on Your throne
And when I was still a long way off, You ran to bring me home
When I was prone to wander, You loved me anyway
When I was six feet under, You pulled me from the grave, yeah

Now this is more than I could ask for and more than I could dream
The One who made the world somehow thinks the world of me
The highest King of Heaven chose to love a fool
I don't understand it, but I know I want nothing more than You
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
[Outro]
I want nothing more than You
