Upon a hill, a perfect Saviour
Upon that day, the greatest love
The punishment that should have fallen on us
Upon Him, upon Him
Upon His head, a crown of thorns
Upon His heart, a broken world
The wage of sin, the weight of our transgressions
Upon Him, upon Him
Christ has died, we are forgiven
And Christ alive, we are the risen
And He shall come again
Praise the King, praise the King
Upon our hearts, His name is written
The King of Kings and Lord of Lords
We're pouring out a song of praise together
Upon Him, upon Him
Christ has died, we are forgiven
And Christ alive, we are the risen
And He shall come again
Praise the King, praise the King
Christ has died, we are forgiven
And Christ alive, we are the risen
And He shall come again
Praise the King, praise the King
