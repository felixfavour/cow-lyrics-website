Jesus at the center of it all
Jesus at the center of it all
From beginning to the end
It will always be, it's always been You, Jesus
Jesus
Jesus at the center of it all
Jesus at the center of it all
From beginning to the end
It will always be, it's always been You, Jesus
Jesus
[Chorus: Julia Vit贸ria & Rachel Novaes, 
Julia Vit贸ria
]
Nothing else matters
Nothing in this world will do
(
Only You, only You
)
Jesus, You're the center
And everything revolves around You
Jesus, You
Jesus be the center of my life
Jesus be the center of my life
From beginning to the end
It will always be, it's always been You, Jesus
Jesus
