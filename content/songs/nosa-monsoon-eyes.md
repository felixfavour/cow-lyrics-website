will try calm all your fears
And I will jump into your tears
And I cannot swim but I'm there
Breaststroking my way
I do love
Your monsoon eyes
Rain to my flowers
Drifting on waters
My darling
Your monsoon eyes
Keep me from drowning
My skies are clouding
Gold
Your tears they are coloured gold
Too bad you don't even know
They nourishing part of my soul
Fold
You can just make a man fold
Not your fault that you're so cold
Things that the previous stole
See you girl you are my weather
Raining tears so take my sweater
You deserve a loving fella
Standing with a new umbrella, oh
I do love
Your monsoon eyes
Rain to my flowers
Drifting on waters
My darling
Your monsoon eyes
Keep me from drowning
My skies are clouding
