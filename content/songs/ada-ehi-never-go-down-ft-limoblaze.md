Just my own pictures taken
 Say cheese, your history's written
 Let all the fears go out the door
Shut your doors and keep them out
But keep the picture of your dream beside your heart
 Oh we're levitating (yeah)
 This joy is elevating
 When you find your pace within the race
Showing everyone the faith, that you found your place
 We never go down, we never go down
 We never go down, no
 Just like the ceiling of stars all over the airspace
 We never go down, no
 We're flying for life
 We're flying for life
Hey, hey-hey
It's L to the I.M.O Blaze
We're flying for life
 Look, the hand of God is upon me
And I never met a thing that could break me
'Cause I never met a thing that could break God
And I'm the apple of his eyes, the MAC is no Windows
For the forces of darkness, they operate
And I know that he got my back like a feather brake
Boy I'm black but I'm a theme of grace
I've been empowered a by spirit I'ma win my race, look
I'm flying high and I will never land, hey (never land)
I got that joy that they can understand, hey
My dream's a valley, there's a well inside me
I look to the mirror, yo nobody can stop me
I don't care if you doubt me, I know who got me
24-7 got His shield around me
So until the day my God comes
You can find me on the mountain top proclaiming to the world
 We never go down (that's right)
We never go down (never going down)
We never go down, no
 Just like the ceiling of stars all over the airspace
 We never go down, no
 Rise, oh fighter
Oh win, oh winner
 And let His fire and His light ignite your heart
 All I'd hear is of the time, before before
 We never go down, we never go down (we never)
 We never go down, no
Just like the ceiling of stars all over the airspace
 We never go down, no
 We're flying for life
 We're flying for life
 We're flying for life
