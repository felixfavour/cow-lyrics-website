This I know
The cross is my unfailing hope
For grace and mercy tell me so
I'm near to Your heart
I'm near to Your heart
I'm so close
I can see the scars that saved my soul
I'm safe in Your arms, You won't let go
Death can't tear us apart
Can't tear us apart
I hear the Heavens, here in Your presence
Spirit move through and through
All of the walls down, freedom is here now
Spirit move through and through
I'm so close
I can see the scars that saved my soul
I'm safe in Your arms, You won't let go
Death can't tear us apart
Can't tear us apart
