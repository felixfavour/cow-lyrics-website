i thought of You when I slept last night
Dreaming of being with You
Holding your hand and never letting go
That's just what I wanna do
I thought of You when I slept last night
Dreaming of being with You
Holding your hand and never letting go
That's just what I wanna do
You're perfect you are
You're perfect you are
Baby you're perfect you are
And I'll be holding your hand for life
Oh you're perfect you are
You're perfect you are
Oh darling you're perfect you are
And I'll be holding your hand for life
Never doubt my love for you
Gonna stay around
Be here for you
I thank the Lord that he brought you
Into my life
Right at the perfect time
You don't have to love me the same
Cos' I wanna give you the world
Gonna be holding your hand
And never letting go
That's what I wanna do
You know you're perfect you are
You're perfect you are
Darling you're perfect you are
And I'll be holding your hand for life
Oh you're perfect you are
Darling you're perfect you are
Oh you're perfect you are
And I'll be holding your hand for life
I'll be holding your hand
I'll never let you go
I'll be holding your hand
Holding your hand
And I'll never let you go
I'll be holding your hand
I'll never let you go
I'll be holding your hand
Holding your hand
And I'll never let you go
Oh you're perfect you are
You're perfect you are
And I love you, I love you that way
Oh you're perfect you are
You're perfect you are
I'll be holding your hand for life
