HERITAGE BY JAHDIEL
oh I was made for this
To know your tender kiss
 To know this love is mine
 To know this love is ours
 And I was made to learn
I was made to sing
given the gift of life
        YOU GAVE ME EVERYTHING...
My feet were made to dance
My spirit made to soar
My life is not by chance
You gave me more and more
And I was made to learn
I was made to sing
N all that stole my joy
I lived it after christ
This one na my heritage,
This one na my culture,
This one na my tradition
I go follow Jesus
I go carry the gospel well u well u
I go carry Jesus higher higher
His mercies no dey cease
His love no dey die

This one na my culture,
This one na my tradition

I have come to know that I'm from another country
For a very long time I have come to know that I'm from another Nation

By the power of Jesus in me
