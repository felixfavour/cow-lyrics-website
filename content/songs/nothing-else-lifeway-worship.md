[Chorus]
I'm caught up in Your presence, I just want to sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment, I never want to leave
Oh, I'm not here for blessings, Jesus, You don't owe me anything
More than anything that You can do, I just want You
And I'm sorry when I've just gone through the motions
I'm sorry when I just sang another song
Take me back to where we started, I open up my heart to You
And I'm sorry when I've come with my agenda
I'm sorry when I forgot that You're enough
Take me back to where wе started, I open up my heart to You
I'm caught up in Your prеsence, I just want to sit here at Your feet
I'm caught up in this holy moment, I never want to leave
Oh, I'm not here for blessings, Jesus, You don't owe me anything
More than anything that You can do, I just want You
[Bridge]
I just want you and nothing else, and nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want you and nothing else, and nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want you and nothing else, and nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want you and nothing else, and nothing else
Jesus, nothing else will do
I just want you and nothing else, and nothing else
Nothing else will do
I just want you and nothing else, and nothing else
Jesus, nothing else will do
