Majesty of heaven
You're glory fills the skies
Light of the world
You are lord of all
Humbled by your presence
Amazed by who you are
Nothing compares
You are lord of all
To you the nations bow down
To you a creation cries out
Majesty
All things you hold together
Your name will stand forever
Majesty
You are majesty
Merciful and mighty
My heart is overwhelmed
You stand alone
You are lord of all
To you the nations bow down
To you a creation cries out
Majesty
All things you hold together
Your name will stand forever
Majesty
You are majesty
