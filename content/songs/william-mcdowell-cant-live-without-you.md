I can't live, can't live without you
I was created to live in your presence
Can't breathe, can't move
There is no life apart from you
I can't live, can't live without you
I was created to live in your presence
Can't breathe, can't move
 There is no life apart from you
I can't live, can't live without you
I was created to live in your presence
Can't breathe, can't move
There is no life apart from you
I need you to live
I need you to breathe
can't live without you
can't live without you
I need you to live
I need you to breathe
can't live without you
can't live without you
 I need you to live
I need you to breathe
can't live without you
can't live without you(4 times)
I can't live, can't live without you
I was created to live in your presence
Can't breathe, can't move
There is no life apart from you(twice)
