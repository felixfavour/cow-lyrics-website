You are greater than the universe
More powerful than the sea
You are fairer than ten thousand
No one compares to thee
The Omnipotent Sovereign
Stronger than a million men
Your Kingdom
Glorious
Victorious
Will never ever end
Reign, Jesus reign
Be Thou glorified above this earthly plain
Son of God
And oh so good
In majesty Your kingdom will
Forever
Reign
You are glorious in life
Victorious in death
And I live to sing your praise
Till I exhale my final breath
And may I soar beyond the sky
And see Your face with my own eyes
In my eternal home
Around the throne
I'll offer up this song
All hail, all hail the power of Jesus' name
Let angels, let angels, let angels prostrate fall
All hail, all hail the power of Jesus' name
Let angels, let angels, let angels prostrate fall
VAMP
Reign
Jesus, reign
Forever(repeat)
And He shall reign forever and ever
Reign
