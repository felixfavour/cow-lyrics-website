Standing in our silence
I hear my heart beating
And if only I could choose
I'd stay here with you
But hold me 'til the train is leaving
Somewhere down the line
After you're gone from sight
Our love will be the same
And, whispering your name
I'll cling to you with all my might
Let me dream of you
But it's true
And wake me up
Love will be there
When this is over and
Somewhere far beyond today
I will find a way to find you
And somehow through the lonely nights
I will leave a light in the dark
Let it lead you to my heart
There's a love inside us
Deep down inside
That goes without saying
Don't say a word
But I'll tell you just the same
That love will find the flame
And that flame will warm the heart
That's waiting
