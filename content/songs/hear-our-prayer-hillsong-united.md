Hear our prayer
Spirit, come
How I long for
Your sweet touch
On my knees
I cry out
Jesus, Savior
Behold your child
Chorus
Like a deer longing for water
My soul yearns;
Only you can fill my deep hunger
My heart burns
My heart burns
Oceans deep
Mountains high
O my God, I cannot live without your love;
I cannot live without your love
(Repeat Chorus)
