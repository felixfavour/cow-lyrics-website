You are a strong and firm foundation
Im filled with joy in my salvation, Lord
You bring life to every nation
You will remain
Glorified, glorified
You take my fear and trepidation
Im filled with holy expectation, Lord
Oh Your love endures forever
You will remain
Glorified, glorified
Be enthroned in our praises
Let the earth hear the joyful sound
For its You who brings salvation
Love and healing all abound in You
And You remain
Glorified, glorified
