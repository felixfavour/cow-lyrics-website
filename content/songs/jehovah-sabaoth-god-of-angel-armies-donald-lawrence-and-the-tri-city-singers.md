I shall not fear the arrow by day
Nor shall I fear the terror by night
The God who governs angel armies
Has set encampments around me
Whom shall I fear?
I shall not fear the arrow by day
Nor shall I fear the terror by night
The God who governs angel armies
Has set encampments around me
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
The God who governs angel armies
Has set encampments around me
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
Whom shall I fear?
Oh-oh-oh
The God who governs angel armies
The God who governs, oh-oh-oh
Has set encampments around me
Encampments around me
Whom shall I fear?
