Listen, gather 'round I found something that you can use
And if you listen, well, I'm here to tell you, you cannot lose
A simple song, simple melody, to remind you that you can be
The greatest ever, defeated never, even though sometimes you may lose
Yes you can, you can do everything if you try, just try
Yes you can, but you have to believe and rely on what you have inside
You can make it through your trials, for your trials will just make you strong
You can do everything, yes you can, ooooh ohhh ohhhhhh
Teach your children well, it's time to tell them just who they are
Train them as they go to let them know that they can go far
Oh my brother why do you wait
Tomorrow just might be too late
For God gave the provision, made the decision
You can do all things through your faith
Yes you can, you can do everything if you try, just try
Yes you can, but you have to believe and rely on what you have inside
You can make it through your trials, for your trials will just make you strong
You can do everything, yes you can, ooooh ohhh ohhhhhh
I can, I can, yes I can do anything
No matter what if you can just conceive it
If you believe it, then you can achieve it
