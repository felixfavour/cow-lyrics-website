His blood still works and I'm glad to report
That it never lost its power
Yes, it works, I've been redeemed
By the blood of the Lamb
His blood still works and I'm glad to report
That it never lost its power
Yes, it works, I've been redeemed
By the blood of the Lamb
His blood still works and I'm here to testify
God is not dead, He's still alive
The same blood that was shed way back at Calvary
Is the same blood that's working now for me
Oh, His blood redeems me from the stain of sin
And His blood cleanses me deep down within
So, if you ask me how I made it and how I've overcome
I can tell you it's because of the blood
His blood still works and I'm glad to report
That it's never lost its power
Yes, it works, I've been redeemed
By the blood of the Lamb
Oh, the blood of Jesus
Oh, the blood of Jesus
Oh, oh the blood, oh, the blood
Oh, the blood, oh, the blood of Jesus
Yes, it does
