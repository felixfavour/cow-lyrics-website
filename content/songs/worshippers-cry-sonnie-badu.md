Daddy, I just wanna take a little time out
And worship You
I wanna join in with the angels
And do what they do in Heaven
All hail the power of Jesus' name
Let angels prostrate fall
Let angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown him, crown him, crown him
Crown him
And crown him, crown him, crown him
And crown him Lord of All So crown him, lift him, crown him
Crown him
And crown him, why don't you crown him
And crown him Lord of All
Oh majesty, we crown you oh God
Ohhhh, we crown you... we crown you
Almighty God, invincible
Father, invincible
My Savior is invincible
Jesus, invincible
