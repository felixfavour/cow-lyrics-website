Took a while for me to see
What You are to me
Is like Water to a thirsty soul
Pour You over me
Things don't always have to go right
Cause You are with me
I can just close my eyes
And shut the world out
I can just close my eyes
And let You in me
Your Peace I find
Your Peace I find
In the middle of the storm
Your Peace I find
Your Peace I find
When the thunder roar
Your Peace I find
Your Peace I find
As the battle rages on
Your Peace I find
Your Peace I find is like water
Washing over me-e
Oh Father
Your Word Your Peace
Washing over me-e
Your Word Your Peace
Your Spirit
Washing over me
I didn't know is no cool
What You mean to me
You're like Water to a thirsty soul ooohhh
Pour You over me
Things don't always have to go right
Cause You are with me
I can just close my eyes
And shut the world out
I can just close my eyes
And let You in me
Your Peace I find
Your Peace I find
In the middle of the storm
Your Peace I find
Your Peace I find
When the thunder roar
Cos Your Peace I find
Your Peace I find
As the battle rages on
Your Peace I find
Your Peace I find is like water
Washing over me
Peace I find
Your Peace I find
In the middle of the storm
Your Peace I find
Your Peace I find
When the thunder roar
You didn't say they'll be no pain
You didn't say they'll be no sighing
You didn't say they'll be no struggle
What You said is You'll always be there
I know You're here aahh
I know You're near
I know You're here
Don't always feel You
But I know You're here
Things don't always have to go right
Things don't always have to know right
Things don't always have to go right
No oo things don't always have to go right
Ehehn aahhh

And shut the world out
