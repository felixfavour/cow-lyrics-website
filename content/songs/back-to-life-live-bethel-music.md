[Chorus]
No longer I who live, but Christ in me
For I've been born again, my heart is free
The hope of Heaven before me, the grave behind
Hallelujah, You brought me back to life
I won't forget the moment
I heard You call my name
Out of the grip of darkness
Into the light of grace
Just like Lazarus
Oh, You brought me back to life
And where there was dead religion
Now there is living faith
All of my hope and freedom
Are found in Jesus' name
Just likе Lazarus
Oh, You brought me back to life
No longer I who livе, but Christ in me
For I've been born again, my heart is free
The hope of Heaven before me, the grave behind
Hallelujah, You brought me back to life
