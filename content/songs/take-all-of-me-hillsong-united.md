[Chorus] 2x
I love You
All of my hope is in You
Jesus Christ take my life
Take all of me
You broke the night like the sun
And healed my heart
With Your great love
Any trouble I couldn't bear
You lifted me upon Your shoulders
[Pre-Chorus]
Love that's stronger
Love that covers sin
And takes the weight of the world
I love You
All of my hope is in You
Jesus Christ take my life
Take all of me
You stand on mountain tops with me
With You I walk through the valleys
You gave Your only Son for me
Your grace is all I rely on
