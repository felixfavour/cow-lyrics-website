He Calls Me Friend
I have a friend, a faithful friend,
And Jesus is His name
He will not leave, He stands by me,
My Shepherd He remains
I have a friend, a mighty friend,
And Jesus is His name
I shall not fear, He holds me near,
His strength will keep me safe
His name is True King Lord of creation,
Ruler without end
I call Him Hope, Peace, Wonderful Saviour
And what joy that Jesus calls me friend!
I have a friend, the kindest friend
And Jesus is His name
He hears my cry, by day or night
And wipes my tears away
His name is True King Lord of creation
Ruler without end
I call Him Hope, Peace, Wonderful Saviour
And what joy that Jesus calls me friend!
I have a friend, a Saviour friend
And Jesus is His name
He fought for me on Calvary
And trampled on the grave!
His name is True King Lord of creation
Ruler without end
I call Him Hope, Peace, Wonderful Saviour
And what joy that Jesus calls me friend!
...We sing
His name is True King Lord of creation
Ruler without end
I call Him Hope, Peace, Wonderful Saviour
And what joy that Jesus calls me friend
