Take my life and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee
Take my moments and my days
Let them flow in ceaseless praise
Take my hands and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love
Take my feet and let them be swift and beautiful for Thee
Take my voice and let me sing always, only, for my King
Take my lips and let them be filled with messages from Thee
Take my silver and my gold, not a mite would I withhold
Take my intellect and use every power as You choose
Here am I, (here I am)
All of me, (all of me)
Take my life, (take my life)
It's all for Thee, (it's all for Thee)
Take my will and make it Thine
It shall be no longer mine
Take my heart, it is Thine own
It shall be Thy royal throne
Take my love, my Lord
I pour at Your feet its treasure store
Take my self and I will be ever, only, all for Thee
Take my self and I will be ever, only, all for Thee
