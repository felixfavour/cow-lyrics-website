From the fire in your eyes
To the shadow of your outstretched arms
From your living word
To the silence in the raging storm
[Pre-Chorus:]
You are Near, Always Near
[Chorus:]
All I really want is You
All I really need is You
It’s only you
All I really want is You
All I really need is You
It’s only you
From the mystery of Grace
To the miracles that shout your name
From the height of your throne
To your warm embrace that calls me Home
[Pre-Chorus:]
You are Near, Always Near
