I just want to be where You are
Dwelling daily in Your presence
I don't want to worship from afar
Draw me near to where You are
I just want to be where You are
In Your dwelling place - spoken
In Your dwelling place forever
Take me to the place where You are
I just want to be with You
I want to be where You are
Dwelling in Your presence
Feasting at Your table
And surrounded by Your glory
In Your presence
That's where I always want to be
I just want to be
I just want to be with You
I just want to be where You are
Dwelling daily in Your presence - spoken
Dwelling daily in Your presence
I don't want to worship from afar
Draw me - spoken
Draw me near to where You are
