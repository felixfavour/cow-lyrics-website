There is a place
That I love to dwell
It's the presence of my Father
All the host of heaven gather
Worshipping, bowing down before Him
There is a place (There is a place)
That I love to dwell (That I love to dwell)
It's the presence of my Father
All the host of heaven gather
Worshipping, bowing down before Him
I know a place (I know a place)
That I love to dwell (That I love to dwell)
It's the presence of my Father
All the host of heaven gather
Worshipping, bowing down before Him
Holy holy (Holy holy)
Holy holy (Holy holy)
Holy holy (Holy holy)
Holy holy (Holy holy)
Holy holy (Holy holy)
Holy holy (Holy holy)
Holy holy (Holy holy)
Holy holy (Holy holy)
