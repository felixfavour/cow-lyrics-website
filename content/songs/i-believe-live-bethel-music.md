I believe in the blood of Jesus that washes white as snow
I believe in the power of the Gospel, still makes the broken whole
I believe that the curse of sin was broken when they rolled away that stone
I believe, I believe, I believe
[Chorus: Jonathan David & Melissa Helser]
As I bow before You, Lord
I will rise in confidence
I will see Your goodnеss more
In the land I'm living in
And no matter whеre I go
And no matter where I've been
I will see Your goodness, Lord
In the land I'm living in
I believe that the walls will start falling when we fall down on our knees
I believe that the lame will go walking, and the blind are gonna see
I believe that the Gates of Hell tremble when the church begins to sing
I believe, I believe, I believe
[Chorus: Jonathan David & Melissa Helser]
As I bow before You, Lord
I will rise in confidence
I will see Your goodness more
In the land I'm living in
And no matter where I go
And no matter where I've been
I will see Your goodness, Lord
In the land I'm living in
