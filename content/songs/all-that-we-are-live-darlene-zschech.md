[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You took up Your cross, gave it all for us
So that we might know grace
You gave up Your crown, an act so profound
We'll never be the same
We will never be the same
All that we are for Your glory
All that we are for Your Name, Jesus
All that we are for Your glory
We praise You, we praise You
[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
