What you're going through, is not the end of you
It's the beginning now
You are in his hands, be still and trust His plan
He'll make a way somehow
But while you're going through, let Jesus work on you
There's nothing else to do but be still and know
He is God alone, He came to make you strong
Though it hurts for a moment, let Him work on you
All you have endured is working for your good
Joy is on the way
Every test and trial last only for a while
He's building up your faith
So while you're going through, let Jesus work on you
There's nothing else to do but be still and know
He is God alone, He came to make you strong
Though it hurts for a moment, let Him work on you
[Interlude]
Oh, He's in control
Let Him work on you
Although it may hurt right now
He's working, He's working
