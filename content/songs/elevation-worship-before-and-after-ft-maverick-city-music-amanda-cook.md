(feat. Amanda Lindsey Cook)
I'm a picture of Your faithfulness
I'm a miracle in process
God I never would have guessed
That You were working in the darkness
Oh Oh
This is my before and after
Oh Oh
There's a new light in my eyes
Oh Oh
Some things the camera can't capture
Oh Oh
I was dead now I'm alive
You taught my heart to beat again
When everything felt lifeless
You lifted me up from the depths
And You gave me back my purpose
Yea
Oh Oh
This is my before and after
Oh Oh
There's a new light in my eyes
Oh Oh
Some things the camera can't capture
Oh Oh
I was dead now I'm alive
Oh I'm alive Oh I'm alive Oh I'm alive Oh I'm alive
Oh I'm alive Oh I'm alive alive alive
Oh I'm alive Oh I'm alive Oh I'm alive
From the ashes you make beautiful things
I know cause you did it in me
From the ashes you make beautiful things
I know cause you did it in me
I know I know
From the ashes you make beautiful things
I know cause you did it in me
From the ashes you make beautiful things
I know cause you did it in me
From the ashes you make beautiful things
I know cause you did it in me
I know cause you did it in me
From the ashes you make beautiful things
I know cause you did it in me
From the ashes you make beautiful things
I know cause you did it in me
I know cause you did it in me
From the ashes you make beautiful things
I know cause you did it in me
I know I know
I thought it was over
I thought it was done
But you always have the last word
And the last word is love
I thought it was over
I thought it was done
But you always have the last word
And the last word is love
Oh I thought it was over
I thought it was done
But you always have the last word yes you do
And the last word is love
Oh I thought it was over
Oh I thought it was done
But you always have the last word
And the last word is love
I thought it was over
I thought it was done
But you always have the last word
And the last word is love
It's Love It's Love
I thought it was over
I thought it was done
But you always have the last word
And the last word is love
It's Love It's Love It's Love
The last word is Love
I barely recognize myself
I barely recognize myself
I barely recognize myself
I barely recognize myself
