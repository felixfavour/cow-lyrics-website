I'll always sing this gospel song
No higher hope, no greater love
A King who came, a life laid down
For the world
I'll always sing this hymn of grace
Heaven sent, here to save
A King who came, a life laid down
For the world
A rugged cross, an empty grave
For God so loved the world that He gave
To us His one and only Son
I'll always sing this gospel song
Sing on
Sing on
The storyline has always been
How broken lives can rise again
What I could not do You have done for me
And the world, all the world
A rugged cross, an empty grave
For God so loved the world that He gave
To us His one and only Son
I'll always sing this gospel song
Sing on, sing on
Sing on, sing on
