Before there was life
You were seated on high
From there You spoke time
And we were already on Your mind
Can't explain Your love
Without performance
You called us Your own
Couldn't afford it
So with Your blood, You bought our freedom
Can't explain Your love
Yeah
Ruler of everything
Worthy of all that we could bring
You are Great Jehovah
All power is Yours,
Without performance
You called us Your own
Couldn't afford it
With Your blood You bought our freedom
Can't explain Your love

You are Ruler (Ruler of everything)
You are (Worthy of all that we could bring)
You are, You are Great Jehovah
All power is Yours
No song we sing (No song we sing)
Can explain Your love of me
You are, You are Great Jehovah
All power (All power[
Here we go
Great Jehovah, Ruler of everything
Our Defender, You are the Most High King
Come on everybody sing it out
Great Jehovah
Great Jehovah, Ruler of everything

Sing God, You reign
Everybody clap your hand
