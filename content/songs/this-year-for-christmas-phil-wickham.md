Some people want diamond rings
Some people want snow
Some people want everything tied in strings and bows
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't think of a single thing
For my list this year
'Cause all that I'll ever need
I have right here
I got all I want
This year for Christmas
Don't need no presents
Underneath the tree
'Cause all I want
This year for Christmas
Is waking up with you
Right here next to me
You took me by the hand
Brought me in from the cold
You give me the kind of love
Oh, that feels like home
