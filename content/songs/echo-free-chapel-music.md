With one voice, we cry out
A chosen generation
We lift up a shout, let it echo
The lost will be found
'Cause You're the one who saves us
Our anthem is loud, let it echo
You are good, You are love
Next to You there is no other
Jesus, Jesus
You are, You are, You are the hope of the world
I will praise
You are, You are, You are the hope of the world
I will shout it
You are, You are, You are the hope of the world
I will praise
You are, You are, You are the hope of the world
I will shout it out
Jesus You are, Jesus You are
The hope of my world
Jesus You are, Jesus You are
The hope of my world
