Here's my heart Lord
Here's my heart Lord
Here's my heart Lord
Speak what is true
Here's my heart Lord
Here's my heart Lord
Here's my heart Lord
Speak what is true
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I am found, I am Yours
I am loved, I'm made pure
And I have life, I can breathe
I am healed, I am free
Here's my heart Lord
Speak what is true
Here's my heart Lord
Speak what is true
Here's my heart Lord
Here's my heart Lord
Here's my heart Lord
Speak what is true
