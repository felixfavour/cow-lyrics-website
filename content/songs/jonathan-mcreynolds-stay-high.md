You can't catch a bird while it's flying in the air
No, you gotta wait, till it comes to the ground
And you can't stop a saint, while they're in full flight
No the devil's gotta wait, till we come down
So, I'll stay high
I ain't coming down for no reason
I'll be reading my word
I ain't coming down for no Satan
I'll be praying to my Lord
I ain't coming down for no sinning
While I am living for my God
I ain't coming down for nobody
No, I'll just stay
Hiiiigh
Hiiiigh
Hiiiigh
Hiiiigh
So watch me
Flllly
Flllly
Flllly
Flllly
See, we've all got targets on our backs
Cause all heaven and hell knows our worth
So am standing guard cause life's coming hard
Soon as we walk out the church
So, I'll stay high
I ain't coming down for no reason
I'll be reading my word
I ain't coming down for no Satan
I'll be praying to my Lord
I ain't coming down for no sinning
While I am living for my God
I ain't coming down for nobody
No, I'll just stay
Hiiiigh
Hiiiigh
Hiiiigh
Hiiiigh
So watch me
Flllly
Flllly
Flllly
Flllly
(Through Jesus we're more than conquerors, c'mon)
No, you can't bring me down at all
You can't bring me down
When God is more than every circumstance
You just hop over the competition like Jordan
I'm opposite the jump, man
So on Your grace and mercy I will fly
When they hate more, I'll pray more
Yes, Lord, imma stay high
I'll stay Hiiiigh
(I will stay Hiiiigh)
Hiiiigh
So watch me
Flllly
Flllly
Flllly
Flllly
Even when the service is over
(Just stay hiiiigh)
And when friends they rolling in the dark, know
(Just stay hiiigh)
When family makes you wanna curse, know just stay (hiiiigh)
Some day we all gotta learn to stay
(hiiiigh)
Mount up on wings like an eagle and stay(hiiiigh)
Know you've got a purpose, so just stay(hiiiigh)
ooooooh (Just stay hiiiigh)
You dont even need them drugs now, you just gotta stay (hiiiigh)
I know that it ain't look good now (you just gotta stay high)
And don't you worry about tomorrow (you just gotta stay hiiiigh)
God gave us strength to (stay hiiiigh)
You just gotta stay high
You just gotta stay high
You just gotta stay high
Stay hiiiigh
You just gotta stay high
Hiiiigh
