You are the light of the world, who else could lead me?
You have the words of life, who else would I follow?
You are the living well for all who are thirsty
You invite me to journey with You and I say yes
Your word is a lamp to my feet
I’ll follow wherever You lead
You’re the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Your spirit is lighting my path
I’ll follow, there’s no turning back
You’re the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
And if it’s the wilderness, I know You’ll lead me through it
And if it’s the promised land, I know You’ve led me to it
You invite me to journey with You and I say yes
Oh, forever, yeah
Your word is a lamp to my feet
I’ll follow wherever You lead
You’re the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Your spirit is lighting my path
I’ll follow, there’s no turning back
You’re the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Your word is a lamp to my feet
I’ll follow wherever You lead
You’re the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
Your spirit is lighting my path
I’ll follow, there’s no turning back
You’re the way, the truth, the life
Now and always
