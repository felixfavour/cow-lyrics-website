All to Him
Who is seated on the throne
Be all majesty and praise
All authority and power
All to Him
Who calls my heart His home
Be my everlasting worship
My trust and my surrender
To Him, who took that cross
And took down all my sin
All my shame I bring
All my soul will sing to Him
Who broke my chains
To live is Christ, to die is gain
There is nothing I want more
Than my last breath confess
A life lived all to Him
All to Jesus
The Saviour of my soul
To Him who reigns above all other names
In earth and sky and heaven
