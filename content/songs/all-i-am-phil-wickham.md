Take these hands
I know they’re empty, but with You, they can
Be used for beauty in Your perfect plan
All I am is Yours
Take these feet
I know they stumble, but You use the weak
You use the humble, so please use me
All I am is Yours
I give You all my life, I’m letting it go
A living sacrifice, no longer my own
All I am is Yours, all I am is Yours
Take this heart
Set it on fire, shine it in the dark
I wanna tell the world of who You are
All I am is Yours
I give You all my life, I’m letting it go
A living sacrifice, no longer my own
All I am is Yours, all I am is Yours
