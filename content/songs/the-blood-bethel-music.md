Everything changed, it's getting harder to recognize
The person I was before I encountered Christ
I don't walk like I used to
I don't talk like I used to
I've been washed from the inside
I've been washed from the inside out
[Chorus: Mitch Wong, 
Mitch Wong & Jenn Johnson
]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I know it was the blood
Could have only been the blood
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I know it was the blood
Could have only been the blood
Ayy
I cannot explain, but nothing's more real than this
In the presence of God, oh, what my hеart experiencеd
When my shame hit the wayside
And my sin met the Most High
I was washed from the inside
I was washed from the inside out
[Chorus: Mitch Wong & Jenn Johnson]
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I know it was the blood
Could have only been the blood
Hallelujah, hallelujah
I know it was the blood
Could have only been the blood
