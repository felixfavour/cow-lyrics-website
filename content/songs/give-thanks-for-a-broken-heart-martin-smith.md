You see the scars I try to hide
Every wound a story I have cried
You always love me, it never ends
'Cause You are not an ordinary friend
What I thought would take me under
Has led me back to You
Every time that I feel I'm falling apart
I give thanks for a broken heart
You're never weary of my complaints
Believing me when I am losing faith
What is shattered, You will mend
'Cause You are not an ordinary friend
Every battle leaves us fragile
And fear comes in the night
Though the weight of this suffering may never depart
I give thanks for a broken heart
And You're the fortress where I'm safe
Covering the moments that I break
You never fight, You just defend
You've been the most extraordinary friend
