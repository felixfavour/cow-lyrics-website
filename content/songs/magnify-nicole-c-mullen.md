I will bless the Lord at all times
And His praise shall continually
Be in my mouth
My soul shall make her boast in thee Lord
The humble shall hear thereof and be glad
Oh give thanks for the Lord he's good
And His mercies and kindness
Will always endure
I'll find my refuge in your shelter
And in your shelter wings
I'll abide
Oh magnify the lord with me
And let us exalt His name together
Oh magnify the Lord with me
And let us exalt His name together
I will bless the Lord at all times
And His praise shall continually
Be in my mouth
My soul shall make her boast in thee Lord
The humble shall hear thereof and be glad
