I find space for what I treasure
I make time for what I want
I choose my priorities and
Jesus you're my number one
So I will make room for you
I will prepare for two
So you don't feel that you
Can't live here, please live in me
I find space for what I treasure
I make time for what I want
I choose my priorities and
Jesus you're my number one
Yes Jesus you're my number
So I will make room for you
I will prepare for two
So you don't feel that you
Can't live here, please live in me
I will make room for you
I will prepare for two
So you don't feel that you
Can't live here, please live in me
I will make room for you
I will prepare for two
So you don't feel that you
Can't live here, please live in me
