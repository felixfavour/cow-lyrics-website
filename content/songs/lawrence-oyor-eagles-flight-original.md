Lion roars
eagles fly
it's in you, you were born to fly
lion roars
eagle fly
it's in you, you were meant to fly
you will see and you will hear
it's in you, you were made to fly
(chants)
it's in you, you were meant to fly
(chants)
let the river flow
eagles fly you were made to fly
eagles fly you were made to fly
heaven is waiting for your flight
creation is waiting for your flight
eagle fly
you were born to fly
He's restoring all the years
I will see and I will hear
I was born for this oh
today the eagle flies
eagle fly you were meant to fly
Nigeria is waiting
Africa is waiting
Nations are waiting
eagle fly you were born to fly
Jesus will not wait in vain
eagle fly you were made to fly
(chants)
eagle fly
eagle fly you were made to fly
I will not stop
till I look just like you
I will not stop
till I fly just like you
eagle fly you were made to fly
if you're patient you will fly
Angels are working on your wings
it's your destiny to fly
eagle fly
eagle fly ooh
