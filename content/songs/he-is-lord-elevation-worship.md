Again the wind is raging
But I will not be shaken
For I know, whose in control
The greater One within me
Is more than what's against me
He's in control, for I know
He'll see me through like before
He is Lord, He is Lord
I'm not afraid anymore
He is Lord, He is Lord
The One who holds tomorrow
Is calling me to follow
Heart and soul, I will go
The Maker of the promise
Will finish what He started
Heart and soul, I will go
He'll see me through like before
He is Lord, He is Lord
I'm not afraid anymore
He is Lord, He is Lord
