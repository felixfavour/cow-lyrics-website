[Chorus]
Something about the name Jesus
Something about the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know
Oh how I love the name Jesus
Oh how I love the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know
Some people say I'm crazy but
I can't explain
The power that I feel
When I call Your name
It's just like fire
Shut up in my bones
The Holy Ghost is movin
And it just won't leave me alone
Something about the name Jesus
Something about the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know
Oh how I love the name Jesus
Oh how I love the name Jesus
It is the sweetest name I know
