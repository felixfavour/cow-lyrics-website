You are good

Good, oh oh
[Spontaneous]
So good
Sing of His goodness tonight
Sing, "You are..."You are good
You're good, oh oh
You are good
You're good, oh oh
You are good
You're good, oh oh
You are good
Yeah You're good, oh oh
[Spontaneous]
We thank You that we can sing this song, God
When the sun's shining down and the rain's coming down
In the valley, in the mountain
In the desert
In the still place
We can sing that You're good
Lord, You have shown us time and time again
In the cross that You bore and the grave that You conquered
In the world that You created
In the way You speak, in the way You live and the way You love
In the way You welcome us into Your Kingdom
With Your grace and the power that You showed
We love You, God
We believe this
Come on, You're never
