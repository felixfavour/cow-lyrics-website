Long time since I've seen your smile
But when I close my eyes
I remember
You were no more than a child
But then so was I
Young and tender
Time carries on;
I guess it always will
But deep inside my heart
Time stands still
Stay for awhile
Well, it's good to see your smile
And I love your company
Stay for awhile
And remember the days gone by;
For a moment it can seem
Just the way it used to be
Snowfalls, phone calls, broken hearts
Clear summer days
Warm and lazy;
Long walks, long talks, after dark;
We vowed we'd never forget
Now it's hazy
