I won't forget
The wonders of how You brought
Deliverance
The exodus of my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
You found me, You freed me
Held back the waters for my release
Oh Yahweh
You're the God who fights for me
Lord of every victory
Hallelujah, hallelujah
You have torn apart the sea
You have led me through the deep
Hallelujah, hallelujah
A cloud by day
Is a sign that You are with me
And the fire by night
Is a guiding light to my feet, woah
[Pre-Chorus]
You found me, You freed me
Held back the waters for my release
Oh Yahweh
