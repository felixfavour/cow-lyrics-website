I almost gave up
Thought I'd had enough
Got right to the end
You talked me out of it
Got lost in the dark
Got tossed in the storm
You spoke to the wind
And brought me out of it
I'm not forsaken
You're never leaving
And I'll keep on moving
Forward with You
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Wherever You lead, I'll follow, follow, follow
With You the future's to live for
Let's go, let's go
Wherever You lead, I'll follow, follow, follow
Oh, oh, no turning back
Had tears in my eyes
Had doubt in my mind
Nevertheless
You talked me out of it
I thought I was trapped
Was sinking so fast
Your unfailing love
Lifted me out of it
I'm not forsaken
You're never leaving
And I'll keep on moving
Forward with You
