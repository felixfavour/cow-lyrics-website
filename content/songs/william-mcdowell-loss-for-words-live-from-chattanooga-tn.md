Amazing God
How great You are
I can't describe, this moment now
Amazing God
How great You are
I can't describe, this moment now
I'm at a loss for words
You leave me speechless
I'm at a loss for words
In Your presence, I am undone
You leave me speechless
I'm at a loss for words
Right here in Your presence
I am undone
So I cry Ohhh
ohhh ohhhhhhhhhhhh
We cry out
ohhhh
No words to say
ohhhh
Oh in your presence we cry
oohhh
Your presence Lord
Is overwhelming
Your sweet embrace, so beautiful
Your presence Lord, there's nothing like it, its overwhelming
Your sweet embrace, so beautiful
So beautiful
So beautiful
You leave me speechless
I'm at a loss for words
What's left to say in your presence
I am undone
