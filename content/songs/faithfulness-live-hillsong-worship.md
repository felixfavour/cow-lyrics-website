From rising sun 'til kingdom come
Your faithful love is unfailing
Though shadows turn and tempests stir
Still You oh God are unchanging
[Pre-Chorus]
Through every hour, I will recall
All my hope is Jesus
Great is Your faithfulness
Great is Your faithfulness
I lift my eyes, I won't forget
How great Your faithfulness
When battle's near I will not fear
Your promises are unshaken
My faith is sure of nothing more
Than Christ alone, my portion
[Pre-Chorus]
Through every hour, I will recall
All my hope is Jesus
