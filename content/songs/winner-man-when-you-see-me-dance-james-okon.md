When you see me dance
I dance like a winner man.
(When you see me dance
I dance like a winner man)

When you see me praise
I praise like a winner man
When you see me praise
I praise like a winner man

When you see me praise
I praise like a winner man
When you see me praise
I praise like a winner man

When you've done all you know
Yet all hell is breaking loose
(Praise Him, Praise Him more.)
We overcame by the Blood and the Word of our testimony.
(Praise Him, lift Him up.)

When your praises goes up, your blessings will surely come.
(Praise Him, Praise Him more.)
Don't you ever lose your praise, for nothing will take your praise.
(Praise Him, gotta Praise Him always)

Got my troubles, got my pains, got my issues
But the Battle has been won in the Spirit
He's my shield and my Buttler and defender
In the name of the Lord am a winner

Vic-to-ry is mine.
I'm a winner.

When you see me dance
I dance like a winner man.
(When you see me dance
I dance like a winner man)

When you see me tambira
I tambira like a winner man.
(When you see me tambira
I tambira like a winner man.)

When you see me dombolo
I dombolo like a winner man.
(When you see me dombolo
I dombolo like a winner man.)
