[Chorus: God's Property]
He'll take the pain away, I know
He'll take the pain away
He'll take the pain away, I know
He'll take the pain away
[Pre-Chorus: God's Property, 
Female Lead
]
Though you've been searching for such a long time (
Hmm
)
Searching for hope and some peace of mind (
There's a friend
)
There's a friend who would step in on time (
And I will
)
He'll take the pain away (
Take the pain away, yes, He will
)
He'll take the pain away
[Chorus: God's Property, 
Female Lead
]
He'll take the pain away, I know
He'll take the pain away
(
He'll take the pain away, oh
)
He'll take the pain away, I know
He'll take the pain away
You've been searching over here and over there
But only God can take your pain away
And I tried Him for myself, and oh
I'm a living witness that God will take the pain away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
