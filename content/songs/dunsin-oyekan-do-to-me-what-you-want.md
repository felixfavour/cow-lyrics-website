Here I am in your presence
do to me what you want..
I'm open before you Lord
do to me what you want..
Here I am in your presence
do to me what you want..
I'm open before you Lord
do to me what you want..
This is the place of encounter,
this is the place of surrender,
this is the place where my flesh gives way,
this is the place where my life is change,
       do to me what you want...
Here I am in your presence oh ohoo

I'm open before you Lord oh oo

     here I am.......
 Here I am in your presence
      do to me what you want,
 I'm open before you Lord
      do to me what you want
This is the place of encounter....
this is the place of surrender......
this is the place where my flesh gives way...
this is the place where my life is change.....
do to me what you want (2x).
the heavens are open, open over me,
the heavens are open, open over me
the heaven are open, open over me(6x).....
  this is the place of revival
   this is the place of renewal
   this is the place where my life is change
