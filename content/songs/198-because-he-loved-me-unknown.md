On a hill called Calvary Jesus my Lord suffered for me. Carried the cross all the way my sins to atone. then they nailed Him to that cross great was the pain and the loss. He suffered it all because He loved me. 

Because he Loved me my savior died on the cross was crucified. No greater love for mortal man has ever been known. Oh praise His dear name He loves me so. Now I am His, He's mine I know. He suffered it all because he loved me. 

Then they carried Him away placed Him in a lonely grave. Surely they thought that this would be the end of this man. But on the third and glorious day God came and rolled the stone away. He rose from the dead because He loved me. 

Because he Loved me my savior died on the cross was crucified. No greater love for mortal man has ever been known. Oh praise His dear name He loves me so. Now I am His, He's mine I know. He suffered it all because he loved me. 

Oh praise His dear name He loves me so. Now I am His, He's mine I know. He suffered it all because He loved me. Because He loved me. Because He loved me.
