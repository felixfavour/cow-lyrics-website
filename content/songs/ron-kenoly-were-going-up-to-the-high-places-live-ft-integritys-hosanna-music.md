We've been deceived by the devil too long
We gonna tear that devil's kingdom down
What he said was his, church, has been ours all along
Tonight, we're gonna tear that devil's kingdom down
We're going up to the high places
We're going up to the high places
We're going up to the high places
To tear the devil's kingdom down
Let's go up
Going up to the high places (we're going up)
Going up to the high places (we're going up)
Going up to the high places (we're going to...)
To tear the devil's kingdom down
Listen, we gotta be strong
We gotta be bold
We're gonna tear the devil's kingdom down
We're gonna reclaim everything that devil stole
We're gonna tear the devil's kingdom down
(Come on church) Let's go up
Going up to the high places (we're going)
Going up to the high places (we're going up)
Going up to the high places
We're gonna tear the devil's kingdom down
You know the church today, the church today is engaged in a spiritual warfare
And the battle goes on between the kingdom of darkness and the Army of God
And there is no demilitarized zone
You're either on the devil's side or on the Lord's side
Now we know that the Lord Jesus Christ has won the ultimate victory at calvary, we know that don't we?
But our mission, our mission is to enforce and maintain all that Jesus bought for us at calvary
There's alot of things that the devil has stolen away from the church
Health, prosperity, peace in our homes and our communities, righteousness in our government
These the things the devil has stole
But as the army of God we're taking it back, amen?!
Are you with me? Yes!!!
Are you with me tonight? Yes!!!
Are you with me right now? Yes!!!
Well let's go up to the high place and fall that devil down
Oh yeah, common church
Going up to the high places
We going up to the high places
Going up to the high places
We going to tear the devil's kingdom down
(Church) Let's go up
Going up to the high places
Going up to the high places
Going up to the high places
To tear the devil's kingdom down
We've been deceived by the devil too long
We're gonna tear the devil's kingdom down
What he says is his has been ours all along
We're gonna tear the devil's kingdom down
Let's go up
Going up to the high places (we going up)
Going up to the high places (we going up)
Going up to the high places
We gonna to tear the devil's kingdom down
We're gonna pull down the altars
We're gonna tear down the walls
We're gonna raise up a banner of righteousness
And declare that Jesus is Lord of all
Going up to the high places (we going up)
Going up to the high places (we going up)
Going up to the high places
We going to tear the devil's kingdom down
We're gonna tear the devil's kingdom down
We're gonna tear the devil's kingdom down
