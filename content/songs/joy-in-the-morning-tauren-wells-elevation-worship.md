Everything happens for a reason, but you don't know what you don't know
And you'll never have peace if you don't let go of tomorrow
'Cause it ain't even faith till your plan falls apart but you still choose to follow
If it doesn't make sense right now, it will when it's over
And there will be joy in the morning
There will be joy in the morning
If it's not good then He's not done, no He's not done with it yet
There will be joy in the morning
Giving in to your feelings is like drowning in the shallows
Oh, you've gotta keep believing еven in the middle of thе unknown
'Cause grace will be there when you come to the end of your rope, when you let go
It may feel like you're going down now, but the story isn't over
There will be joy in the morning (Yeah)
There will be joy in the morning (Woo)
If it's not good then He's not done, no He's not done with it yet
There will be joy in the morning (Woah)

If it's not good then He's not done, no He's not done with it yet, no (Hey)
If it's not good then He's not done, no He's not done with it yet (I know) (Oh)
If it's not good then He's not done, no He's not done with it yet (Hey)
If it's not good then He's not done, no He's not done with it yet
