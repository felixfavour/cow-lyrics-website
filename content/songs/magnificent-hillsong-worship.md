Who compares to You?
Who set the stars in their place?
You who calmed the raging seas
That came crashing over me
Who compares to You?
You who bring the morning light
The hope of all the earth
Is rest assured in Your great love
You are magnificent, eternally wonderful, glorious
Jesus, No one ever will compare to You, Jesus
Where the evening fades
You call forth songs of joy (Songs of joy)
As the morning wakes
We Your children give You praise
You are magnificent, eternally wonderful, glorious
Jesus, no one ever will compare
You are magnificent, eternally wonderful, glorious
Jesus, no one ever will compare to You, Jesus
