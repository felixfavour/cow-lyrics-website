There are things, as we travel this earth's shifting sand. That transcend all the reason of man; but the things that matter the most in this world, they can never be held in our hand. 

I believe in a hill called Mount Calvary. I'll believe whatever the cost; and when time has surrendered and earth is no more, I'll still cling to that old rugged cross. 

I believe that the Christ who was slain on that cross. Has the power to change lives today; for he changed me completely - a new life is mine. That is why by the cross I will stay.  

I believe in a hill called Mount Calvary. I'll believe whatever the cost; and when time has surrendered and earth is no more, I'll still cling to that old rugged cross. 

I believe that this life with its great mysteries. Surely someday will come to an end; but faith will conquer the darkness and death. And will lead me at last to my Friend.

I believe in a hill called Mount Calvary. I'll believe whatever the cost; and when time has surrendered and earth is no more, I'll still cling to that old rugged cross.
