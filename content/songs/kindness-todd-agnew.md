Open up the skies of mercy
Rain down your cleansing flood
Healing waters rise around us
Hear our cries, Lord Let 'em rise
It's Your kindness Lord that leads us to repentance
Your favor, Lord, is our desire
It's Your beauty, Lord, that makes us stand in silence
Your love, Your loveâ€¦ is better than life
We can feel Your mercy falling
You are turning our hearts back again
Hear our praises rise to heaven
Draw us near, Lord, meet us here
Chorus
Your love is Better than life
Your grace and Your mercy Is better than life
Your kindness, Lord Is better than life
Chorus
