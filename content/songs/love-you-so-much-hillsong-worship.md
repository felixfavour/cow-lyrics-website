Hear this praises from a grateful heart
Each time I think of You the praises start
Love You so much, Jesus
Love You so much
Lord, I love You, my soul sings
In Your presence carried on Your wings
Love You so much, Jesus
Love You so much
How my soul longs for you
Longs to worship You forever
In Your power and majesty
Lift my hands, lift my heart
Lift my voice towards the heavens
For You are my sun and shield
Hear this praises from a grateful heart
Each time I think of You the praises start
Love You so much, Jesus
Love You so much
Lord, I love You, my soul sings
In Your presence, carried on Your wings
Love You so much, Jesus
Love You so much
