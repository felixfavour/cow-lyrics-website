I don't thank You near enough
I get too familiar with Your love
Lord, forgive me for missing the little things you've done
How You gave me twelve notes
And the breath in my lungs
And I'm gonna praise You with this one
Every good thing in my life
Comes down from the Father of lights
It comes down from the Father, down from the Father
Down from the Father of lights
All the best things in this world
Money just can't buy
They come down from the Father, down from the Father
Down from the Father of lights
Down, down, down, down from the Father of lights
Down, down, down, down from the Father of lights
I remember where I was
Out of strength, nowhere to run
And I'm so glad that You ran to me and picked me up
And You gave me twelve notes
And the breath in my lungs
And I'm gonna praise you with this one
