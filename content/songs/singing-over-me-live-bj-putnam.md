Your presence Lord is life to me
It's water to my soul
Your Spirit Lord will ever be
Breath for these dry bones
[Pre-Chorus]
All I need to know
Is that I'll never be alone
And all I need to hear
Is Heaven singing over me
You're singing over me
You're singing over me
That's all I'll ever need
That's all I'll ever need
You're singing over me
You're singing over me
That's all I'll ever need
That's all I'll ever need
Yeah
Your goodness God it follows me
Everywhere I go
Your mercy is a melody
Ringing in my soul
