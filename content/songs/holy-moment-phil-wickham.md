It's who You were when the stars lit up
It's who You are moving here in us
You never change, now and forever
You will be holy, holy
It's who You were when You bled for me
It's who You are, resurrected King, oh
You never change, now and forever
You will be holy
[Chorus: Naomi Raine, 
Phil Wickham
 & 
Both
]
You're Holy
, holy
You're Holy, oh
 (Woah)
You are, You are, You are holy
Holy (
Holy, oh
)
[Bridge: Phil Wickham & Naomi Raine, 
Naomi Raine
]
It's who You were
God, You've been perfect from the start
It's who You are
The Savior of my broken hеart
You never change
Alpha, Omеga, You will be
Holy, holy
