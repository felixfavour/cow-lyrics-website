Thereâ€™s no other name like the name of Jesus
Yeah, it says
Your name is awesome, your name is great
Your name is mighty and worthy of praise
Your name is healing, your name is peace
Your name is all I need
Yeah yeah
Chorus:
Your name is awesome, your name is great
Your name is mighty and worthy of praise
Your name is healing, your name is peace
Your name is all I need
There is power, power in the name
So much power in the name, power in the name
Say there is power, power in the name
So much power, power in the name
Chorus:
Your name is awesome, your name is great
Your name is mighty and worthy of praise
Your name is healing, your name is peace
Your name is all I need
(Jesus is all we need)
There is power, power in the name
So much power in, power in the name
God gave us power in the name, power in the name
Power in the name, power in the name
Healing in the name, I can call the name of Jesus ..
Healing in the name, I can say is healing in
So much healing, healing in the name
