Carry Am Go - Moses Bliss
...
Have you seen my babe
Have you seen my love
Have you seen my woman
My personal gift from God
Omo Dey don
This one na full package person
God so love the boy bless me wiith a precious Jewel
I don find good thing ,I'm no longer looking
I found my own flesh , u00e2¦
I don find good thing ,I'm no longer looking
I found my own fleshI found the one cause she dey give me joy
I go carry am go
Carry am go
Na you wey get my heart
Nothing go tear us apart
I go carry am go
Carry am go
My baby no Dey play
She's looking so taken away
Nananaannananana
If I dey chase one thousand before,we go chase ten thousand together.
Oh my darling me and you go they till forever
I no they search again,,everything I want all in order.
