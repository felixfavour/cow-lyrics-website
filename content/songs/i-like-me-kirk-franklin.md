[Hook]
I like me; yo, you like me?
‘Cause I like me, do you like me?
See I like me, ‘cause he likes me
God likes me; yo, you don’t like me?
I like me; yo, you like me?
‘Cause I like me, do you like me?
See I like me, ‘cause he likes me
God likes me; yo, you don’t like me?
Short, big nose, big lip
Kinda s-s-stutter but I-but I never trip
Got my daddy’s swagger and I walk with a limp
Got a hot wife, no need to be a pimp
Never been cute, never been fly
Since I’ve been changed, got that twinkle in my eye
Got my grill fixed, now I smile when I speak
“Tell me who that?” Yo, it’s that Jesus Freak
[Hook]
I like me; yo, you like me?
‘Cause I like me, do you like me?
See I like me, ‘cause he likes me
God likes me; yo, you don’t like me?
I like me; yo, you like me?
‘Cause I like me, do you like me?
See I like me, ‘cause he likes me
God likes me; yo, you don’t like me?
