...
What a joy it is to serve You
You took my place and made me Your glory
What an honour it is to call You Lord
You alone can raise and raze kings and kingdoms.
You have never lost a battle
You are Lord commander of the angel army.
You told us to use your name Lord
For nothing changes your name
but your name changes everything.
Your name is Holy
Lord of my life I serve you wholly
Your word is truth and the only
Yes we declare ,You are Lord over all
What a blessing it is to love you
You said in your word, all things are working together for me
How can men try to overthrow you Lord God
When Heaven is your throne and the earth your footstool
You have never lost a battle
You are Lord commander of the angel army.
You told us to use your name
For nothing changes your name
but your name changes everything.
Your name is Holy
Lord of my life, I serve you wholly
Your word is truth and the only
Yes we declare, You are Lord over all.
I delight
in your warming grace
Ever joyful for your grace
You are God to every race
Yes we declare, You are Lord over all
