God I'm wrestling with the waiting again, again, again
My impatience a disease in this cage for mice and men
They say, "boy, you better keep running," but at this pace I can't sustain
My head knows to trust You but the heart of me is slain
Faithful are the wounds of a Friend
Faithful are the dealings of Your hand
The troubles and the trials like the gold refined in fire
Faithful are the wounds of a Friend
God these questions, they just won't leave me alone, alonе
Will this crushing ever end, or is this achе now my home?
Am I a prisoner of hope, or just the warden of my pain?
My head knows to trust You but the heart of me is slain, yeah
Faithful are the wounds of a Friend
Faithful are the dealings of Your hand
The troubles and the trials like the gold refined in fire
Faithful are the wounds of a Friend
[Bridge]

Oh, oh, oh, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
