Snow covered rooftops
Lights on the trees
The sound of singing
I hear down every street
Families have gathered
From miles away
Oh, Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day
You see that old tree
Down Cotton Lane
Those lights keep shining
It?s always the same
We hear the church bells
Ring out to say
Oh, Merry Christmas
It?s Christmas day
Oh, Merry Christmas
It's Christmas day
Swing the lights and hang the stockings
Decorate with green and red
Made the cookies for old Santa
Made a runway for his sled
