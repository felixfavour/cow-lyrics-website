There's a song that's on my lips
From the moment that I rise
To the One who rescued me and brought me life
Praise awaits You at the dawn
Praise awaits You in the night
With the heavens I will sing and lift You high
Glory be to God, the Father
Glory be to God, the Son
Glory be to God, the Spirit
All glory to the One
Glory to the Lord, Almighty
Glory to the King, Most High
Glory be to God, forever
All glory to the One
Praise awaits You at the dawn
Praise awaits You in the night
With the heavens I will sing and lift You high
Glory be to God, the Father
Glory be to God, the Son
Glory be to God, the Spirit
All glory to the One
Glory to the Lord, Almighty
Glory to the King, Most High
Glory be to God, forever
All glory to the One
