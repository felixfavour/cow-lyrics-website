I can feel You smiling, smiling, smiling at me
I can feel the warmth of Your presence hovering over me
I can feel Your Holy Spirit moving in me
No matter what my eyes might see, I know You're with me
You're with me when I'm all alone
You're with me when I'm not feeling strong
You're with me, I know You're with me
When family and friends are gone
I'll keep holding on
Because You're with me, I know You're with me
I can feel You smiling, smiling, smiling at me
I can feel the warmth of Your presence hovering over me
I can feel Your Holy Spirit moving in me
No matter what my eyes might see, I know You're with me
In the cold shadow of darkness, in the valley of despair
You're with me, I know You're with me
You promised you would never leave me
You promised that You'd be near
You're with me, I know You're with me
I can feel You smiling, smiling, smiling at me
I can feel the warmth of Your presence hovering over me
I can feel Your Holy Spirit moving in me
No matter what my eyes might see, I know You're with me
