I feel it in my bones, You're about to move
I feel it in the wind, You're about to ride in
You said that You would pour Your spirit out
You said that You would fall on sons and daughters
So come
[Interlude]
I feel it in my bones, You're about to move
I feel it in the wind, You're about to ride in
You said that You would pour Your spirit out
You said that You would fall on sons and daughters
[Pre-Chorus]
So like the rain, come drench us in love
And let Your glory rush in like a flood
And we are fixed on this one thing
To know Your goodness and see Your glory
We're transformed by this one thing
To know Your presence and see Your beauty
I can see it now, Your kingdom come
I can hear it now, the sounds of heaven
You said that if we ask, we'll receive
So we are asking for the greater measure
