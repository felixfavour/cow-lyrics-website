VERSE 1
I don't believe in fairy tales
I guess I've outgrown them
But that doesn't mean I don't believe that there's something bigger than me
Cause I've seen it in a hospital room
When the doctors said,
Sorry there's nothing more we can do
Well it wasn't through
VERSE 2
I've never seen a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow
But I've got a promise I can hold in the middle of the struggle
God if you said it You'll perform it
May not be how I want You to
But here's what I'll do
CHORUS
I'm gonna wait on You
I'm gonna wait on You
I've tasted Your goodness
I'll trust in Your promise
I'm gonna wait on You
VERSE 3
I know You've ordered every step
Yeah, You are the Author
And there's no predicting what is next
But You hold the future
And all the questions they come second to the one I know is true
You've always been true
BRIDGE
Wait on the Lord
Wait on the Lord
He will renew your strength
So wait I say
