Your mercies are new every morning
This is everlasting
This is never ending
Your covenant is sure
Your kingdom has no end
This is everlasting

Olorun iyanu
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
From cradle days I have never seen you forsake your beloved
It is not what you do
Now I am older
I barely see that
Ohh
Your banner over me is love
This just who you are o
Oba alanu
Olorun iyanu
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
Oba alanu
Olorun iyanu
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
You are word made flesh
Manifest in our presence
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
One that bore my iniquities
Cross of calvary paid for my sins
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
Oba alanu
Olorun iyanu
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
Oba alanu
Olorun iyanu
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
Oba alanu (Compassionate & merciful)
Kind of loving, that's who you are
Oba alanu
See how you made my life so beautiful
See how you adorn me with your glory
Merciful king o
You paid the debt you did not owe
My Jesus
Oba alanu
Oba alanu
Oba alanu
