Saturday was silent, surely it was through
But since when has impossible ever stopped You?
Friday's disappointment is Sunday's empty tomb
Since when has impossible ever stopped You? Yeah
This is the sound of dry bones rattling
This is the praise, make a dead man walk again
Open the grave, I'm coming out
I'm gonna live, gonna live again
This is the sound of dry bones rattling
Yeah, oh
Pentecostal fire stirring something new
You're not gonna run out of miracles anytime soon
Yeah, resurrection powеr runs in my veins too, yeah
I beliеve there's another miracle here in this room
This is the sound of dry bones rattling, hey
This is the praise, make a dead man walk again
Open the grave, I'm coming out
I'm gonna live, gonna live again
This is the sound of dry bones rattling
Rattle
