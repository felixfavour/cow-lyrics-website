It pays to serve Jesus, I speak from my heart;
He’ll always be with us, if we do our part;
There’s naught in this wide world can pleasure afford,
There’s peace and contentment in serving the Lord.

I love Him far better than in days of yore,
I’ll serve Him more truly than ever before;
I’ll do as He bids me, whatever the cost,
I’ll be a true soldier — I’ll die at my post.

And oft when I’m tempted to turn from the track,
I think of my Savior — my mind wanders back
To the place where they nailed Him on Calvary’s tree—
I hear a voice saying, I suffered for thee. 

There’s a place that remembrance still brings back to me,
’Twas there I found pardon — ’twas Heaven to me;
There Jesus spoke sweetly to my weary soul,
My sins were forgiven, He made my heart whole.

How rich is the blessing the world cannot give,
I’m satisfied fully for Jesus to live;
Tho’ friends may forsake me, and trials arise,
I’m trusting in Jesus, His love never dies.
