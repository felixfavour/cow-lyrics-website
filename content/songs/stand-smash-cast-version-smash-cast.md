[SAM]
What do you do
When you've done all you can
And it seems like you can't make it through?
And what do you say when your friends turn away?
You're alone
Tell me what do you give
When you've given your all
And it seem like you can't make it through?
Well, you just stand when there's nothing left to do
You just stand (Stand)
Watch the Lord see you through
Yes, after you've done all you can
You just stand
Tell me, what do you do?
[KAREN & (CHOIR)]
When you given your all and it seems
It seems like you can't make it through
Well you just stand (You just stand)
When there's nothing left to do you just stand (You just stand)
Watch the Lord see you through
Yes, after you've done all you can
You just stand
Stand and be sure (And be sure)
And be not entangled
In bondage again
