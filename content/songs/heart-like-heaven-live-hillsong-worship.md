Holy
No measure knows Your worth
Face down
Where mercy finds me first
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooo...  If You sought perfection
Ooo... I'd die trying to reach it
Ooo... But this broken heart is all You want
Singing holy
Heart like heaven
Singing holy
God Almighty
Own this heart broke sound
Singing holy is Your Name
Singing holy is Your Name
[Bridge]
Own the sound forever
Heart and heaven together
Singing holy is Your Name
And if it lifts You higher
Burn in me Your desire
A passion worthy of Your Name
