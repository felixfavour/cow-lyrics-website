[Instrumental]
What was torn You mend again
You redesign the tattered thread by thread
You take the broken and destroyed
And You rebuild, You make whole
Joy, begin to rise
And hope, begin to light the dark
Our God exchanges old for new
Dawn, has conquered night
And death, has lost to life
And now, we are exchanging old for new
You turn our flame into a fire
In You we walk in the impossible
We take Your love into the world
We let our light shine, we let it burn
Oh!
Joy, begin to rise
And hope, begin to light the dark
Our God exchanges old for new
Dawn, has conquered night
And death, has lost to life
And now, we are exchanging old for new
