The sparrow's not worried about tomorrow
Or the troubles to come
The lily's not thinking about the seasons
The drought or the flood
The tree that's planted by the water
Isn't phased by the fire
So why should I be?
'Cause you take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
And you hold me in your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in your love, no matter what the future brings
Yeah, you take good care of me
The sun's not worried about the winter
'Cause soon it will pass
The light's not thinking about the darkness
Or the shadow it cast
A heart that's planted in forgiveness
Doesn't dwell in the past
So why should I be?
'Cause you take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
And you hold me in your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in your love, no matter what the future brings
Yeah, you take good care of me
I know there must be more
But I can't get past your kindness
I know there's got to be more
But I can't get past your goodness
I know there must be more
But I can't get past your kindness
I know there's got to be more
But I can't get past your goodness
You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
You hold me in your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in your love, no matter what the future brings
Oh, you take good care of me
