Breaking the silence, into the chaos you came
Born in our likeness, held in the hands that you made
For our deliverance, your promise was given a name
[Refrain 1]
Emmanuel, the God who saves
I hear a voice from Heaven declare
"Prepare the way"Emmanuel, oh praise the name
I hear the sound, Heaven cried out
And love made a way
Christmas was born on that day
Oh, what a day, oh, what a day
Christmas was born on that day
Oh, what a day, oh, what a day
As it is written, Jesus, the glory of God
No reputation, you took on our flesh and blood
For our forgiveness
And for the world you so loved
[Refrain 2]
Emmanuel, the God who saves
I hear a voice from Heaven declare
"Prepare the way"Emmanuel, oh praise the name
I hear the sound, Heaven cried out
And love made a way
