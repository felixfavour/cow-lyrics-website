All to Jesus, I surrender
All to Him I freely give
All will ever, love and trust Him
In His presence, daily live
All to Jesus, I surrender
Humbly at His feet I bow
Worldly pleasures, all forsaken
Take me Jesus, take me now
I surrender all, I surrender all
All to Thee my Blessed Savior
I surrender all
All to Jesus, I surrender
Lord I give myself to Thee
Fill me with Thy, love and power
Let Thy Blessing follow me
I surrender all, I surrender all
All to Thee my Blessed Savior
I surrender all
I surrender all, I surrender all
I surrender all, I surrender all
