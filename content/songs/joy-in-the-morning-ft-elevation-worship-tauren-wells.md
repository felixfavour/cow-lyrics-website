Everything happens for a reason, but you don't know what you don't know
And you'll never have peace if you don't let go of tomorrow
Cause it ain't even faith till your plan falls apart but you still choose to follow, uh
If it doesn't make sense right now, it will when it's over

There will be joy in the morning
There will be joy in the morning
Giving in to your feelings is like drowning in the shadows
Oh, you gotta keep believing even in the middle of the unknown
Cause grace will be there when you come to the end of your rope and you let go (Oh)
It may feel like you're goin' down now, but the story isn't over (Oh)
