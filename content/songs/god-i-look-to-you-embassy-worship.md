God, I look to You, 
I won't be overwhelmed
Give me vision
To see things like You do
God, I look to You, 
You're where my help comes from
Give me wisdom
You know just what to do

And I will love You, Lord my strength
I will love You, Lord my shield
Yes, I will love You, Lord, my rock
Forever all my days, I will love You, God
 
I will love You, Lord my strength
I will love You, Lord my shield
I will love You, Lord, my rock
Forever all my days, I will love You, God

Hallelujah our God reigns
Hallelujah our God reigns
Hallelujah our God reigns
Forever all my days, hallelujah

Oh
Oh
Oh
Forever all my days, I will love You, God
