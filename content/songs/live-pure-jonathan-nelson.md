Every day I live, I live for You
Every song I sing, I sing for You
Every time my heart
Beats it's for You
Everyone that sees me
Will see You
I'm ready,so ready
To live for You
It's my desire... to live in truth!
Let the meditation
Of my heart be pure
Of my mind stay pure
Lord, I will endure
Every melody that comes
From me be pure
Every song stay pure
Lord, I will endure!
I wanna live pure!
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh...
Every day I live, I live for You
Every song I sing, I sing for You
Every time my heart
Beats it's for You;
Everyone that sees me
Will see You!
I'm ready--so ready
