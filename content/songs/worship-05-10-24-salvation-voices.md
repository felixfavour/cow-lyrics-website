You deserve the glory and the honour
And we lift our hands in worship
As we praise Your holy name

For You are great,
You do miracles so great
There is no one else like You, 
There is no one else like You

Hallowed be Your Name 
Great and Mighty God
Hallowed be Your Name 
All sufficient One
Hallowed be Your Name 
Shepherd of my soul
Hallowed be Your Name

Great are You Lord, 
Great are You Lord,
Great are You Lord, 
Great are You Lord

Jesus, you are so good,
Jesus, you are so good

What no man can do
You have done for me
What no man can do
You have done for me

Jesus, we lift your name on high
Your name on high
Be lifted high

I got joy joy joy joy oh joy, joy joy
Joy overflow
In my life

We call Him Ebube Dike,
(We call Him Glorious Warrior)
Jehovah Jireh Ebube Dike
(Ha eeee Jehovah Ebube Dike)
