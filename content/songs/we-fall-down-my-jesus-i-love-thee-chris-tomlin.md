We fall down
We lay our crowns
At the feet of jesus
The greatness of
Mercy and love
At the feet of jesus
We cry holy, holy, holy
We cry holy, holy, holy
We cry holy, holy, holy
Is the lamb
We cry holy, holy, holy
We cry holy, holy, holy
We cry holy, holy, holy
Is the lamb [x2]
[Outro]
My jesus, i love you
I know thou are mine
To thee all the follies of sin i resign
My gracious redeemer
My savior, art thou
If ever i'll love you
My jesus tis now
