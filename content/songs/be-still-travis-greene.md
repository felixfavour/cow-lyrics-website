We wait on You
Everybody's moving
Everyone is going somewhere
With everything they're tryingâ€‹
Just to make it
To a place where I am not there
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But when the noise is over
A still small voice you will hear
I hope that you believe me
When I tell ya
That I'll handle all of your cares
Just wait on me
Be still and know, that I am God
Be still and know, that I am God
Just trust and know, that I am God
And I'm in control, I am still; God
[Post-Chorus 1]
Oh, oh-oh-ooh
Oh, oh-oh-ooh
