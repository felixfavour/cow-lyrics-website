Father our heart are filled with expectaion
They are filled with love and a passion for you
We have a hunger and a thirst that only u can satisfy
Lord we enter this moment with antisipation we know that in your precence bodies are healed, broken dreams are restored, and lives are transformed, because with u all things are possible
Lord we say as we worship you are welcome here
Comsume us
Change us
Give us visons and dream
Give us your hear for the nations
Give us your heat for this generation
And father let our generation arise and demonstrate the kinda selfless faith that will change the world.Let a generation emerge that will manifest your love in the earth so that all will come to kno you
As We worhip let your presence fill this room, relese signs wonders and miracles; we'll be changed
We expect an incounter with you & we knoW well never be the same
As we worhip (x3)
