I dream of being a doctor
I dream of being a pilot
I dream of being a soccer player
I dream of being a basketball player
I dream of being a pastor
I dream of being a race car driver
I dream of becoming a teacher
His Momma said here's
Some fish and bread
There's just enough to get You by
It's not a lot, but
It's all that We've got
Then a tear came to Her eye
And She took it, blessed it
As She looked up to the sky
She said, "Take it and share it
I pray it will be multiplied"
It was so little there were so many
To feed Them all would take so much
But He didn't laugh when the boy gave Him
What He knew was not enough
