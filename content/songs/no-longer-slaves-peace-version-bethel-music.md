[Intro: Melissa Helser]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
You unravel me with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance from my enemies
'Til all my fears are gone
[Chorus: Jonathan David Helser & 
Melissa Helser
]
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
From my mother's womb, You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I've been born again, into Your family
Your blood flows through my veins
[Chorus: Jonathan David Helser & Melissa Helser]
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
