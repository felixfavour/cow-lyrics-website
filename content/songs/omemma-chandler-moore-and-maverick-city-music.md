I know He loves me, I know He cares
Whenever I call, He always is right there

In times of trouble, He is my help
Yeah, I know no fear
I know He'll be right there

Ay, He really does what He says He will do
My God really moves, oh

Why would I doubt when He always comes through?
My God really moves, oh

Omemma
You're always on time
You can do no wrong

Omemma
You leave the 99, always for the one

He really does what He says He will do
My God really moves, oh

You leave the 99, always for the one
