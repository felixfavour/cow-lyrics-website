It was my cross You bore
so I could live in the freedom You died for
and now my life is Yours
and I will sing of Your goodness forevermore

Worthy is Your name, Jesus
You deserve the praise
Worthy is Your name
(repeat)

And now my shame is gone
I stand amazed in Your love undeniable
Your grace goes on and on
And I will sing of Your goodness forevermore

Worthy is Your name, Jesus
You deserve the praise
Worthy is Your name
(repeat)

Be exalted now in the heavens
As Your glory fills this place
You alone deserve all praise
You're the name above all names
(repeat)

Worthy is Your name, Jesus
You deserve the praise
Worthy is Your name
(repeat)
