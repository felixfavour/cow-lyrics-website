Not gonna wait, wait for the walls to fall
I know a name that will bring them down
I've got a praise, waking within my soul
I'm not ashamed to declare it now
Light of the world, trample the darkness
Nothing can stop it, You are the God of the promise
Every word will be accomplished
Nothing can stop it, You are the God of the promise
Prepare the way, the King of Glory comes
Before His name, every fear must bow
Throw off your chains, Jesus destroyed them all
Up from the grave, He is with us now
Light of the world, trample the darkness
Nothing can stop it, You are the God of the promise
Every word will be accomplished
Nothing can stop it, You are the God of the promise
[Bridge]
The gates of hell will never stand a chance
Your name prevails, Jesus the great I am
No word will fail, no weapon formed against
Your name prevails, Jesus the great I am
The gates of hell will never stand a chance
Your name prevails, Jesus the great I am
No word will fail, no weapon formed against
Your name prevails, Jesus the great I am
