Woke up to a world that is changing
Looking out the window, got me wondering lately
Will we be okay?
Will we be okay? (Huh, yes)
One day I can feel the sun shining
Next day a bullet can leave a momma cryin'
Will she be okay? (Lord have mercy)
Tell me will we be okay?
[Pre-Chorus]
(Truth is)
Life is taking everything that I have
Just to survive (Can I testify?)
I got twenty-five dollars in my pocket
And I think another ten in my glove compartment
I'm trying so bad not to cry, but it's hard to stop it
But you say all of my needs, you promised, you got it
[Refrain]
So I'm gon' be okay (Hahaha, yes)
Iâ€™m gon' be okay (Sing) (
Okay, okay
)
See I gotta remember, that my God is bigger
Than any battle I'll ever face
So I'm gon' be okay
