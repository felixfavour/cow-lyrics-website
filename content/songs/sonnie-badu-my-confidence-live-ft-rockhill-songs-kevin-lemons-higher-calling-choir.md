I have confidence in You
Jesus
I have confidence in You
Savior
I have confidence in You
Anytime anywhere
I have confidence in You when everybody let me down
Mm mm
When everybody let me down oo
I heard about Abraham You never let him down
I heard about Shadrach Meshach and Abednego You never let them down
And I heard about Daniel in the lions den You showed up
After ninety years of Sarah barren You gave her a son , You gave her a son
Oh what about David, he said, in sin did my mother conceived me but You made him a king
Moving him from the wilderness to the palace
You pick messes and you make them a message
And you always take trashes and turn them into treasure
Who am I, who am I, to doubt who You are ?
Who am I, who am I to doubt who You are ?
All I got to do is this...
I have confidence in You
Jesus
I have confidence in You
Savior
I have confidence in You
Anytime anywhere
I have confidence in You
Jehovah
Jehovah 8x
Emmanuel 8x
Jehovah
Oh Baba Oh Baba
My confidence is in You
