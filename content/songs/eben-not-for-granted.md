"Not For Granted"
King of kings, Lord of Lords
Mighty one, great I am
There's no one like You
There's no one like You
Grace unending
Peace like river
Joy like fountain, as we worship
There's no one like You
There's no one like You
King of kings, Lord of Lords
Mighty one, great I am
There's no one like You
There's no one like You
Grace unending
Peace like river
Joy like fountain, as we worship
There's no one like You
There's no one like You
King of kings, Lord of Lords
Mighty one, great I am
There's no one like You
There's no one like You
Grace unending
Peace like river
Joy like fountain, as we worship
There's no one like You
There's no one like You
King of kings, Lord of Lords
Mighty one, great I am
There's no one like You
There's no one like You
Grace unending
Peace like river
Joy like fountain, as we worship
There's no one like You
There's no one like You
Grace unending
Peace like river
Joy like fountain, as we worship
There's no one like You
There's no one like You
I do not take for granted
The love You have for me
The way You love me, Jesus
I've never known before
I do not take for granted
The love You have for me
The way You love me, Jesus
I've never known before
I do not take for granted
The love You have for me
The way You love me, Jesus
I've never known before
I do not take for granted
The love You have for me
The way You love me, Jesus
I've never known before
All I am is Yours
All I am is Yours
All I am is Yours
All I am is Yours
...
I do not take for granted
The love You have for me
The way You love me, Jesus
I've never known before
I do not take for granted
The love You have for me
The way You love me, Jesus
I've never known before
The way You love me, Jesus
I've never known before
All I am is Yours
All I am is Yours
I'm Yours forever
