I don't have enough words
I'll never live enough lifetimes
To fully know Your worth
To know all that You deserve
And all of my deceptions
All of my duplicity
Now there is no record
You assume the best of me
[Chorus: Cody Carnes & Mariah McManus]
And this is why I thank the Lord for saving me
When I was weak
So I will sing
This is why I thank the Lord for everything
This is why I thank the Lord
All of my affection
Everything I have to give
The sum of my attention
Is measured in the praise I lift
[Chorus: Cody Carnes, Amanda Cook, Joe L Barnes & Mosaic MSC, 
Joe L Barnes
]
Oh, this is how I thank the Lord for saving me
When I was weak
So I will sing
This is how I thank the Lord for everything
This is how I thank the Lord (
Thank You, Jesus
)
This is how I thank the Lord for loving me
And keeping me
So I will sing
This is how I thank the Lord for everything
This is how I thank the Lord
