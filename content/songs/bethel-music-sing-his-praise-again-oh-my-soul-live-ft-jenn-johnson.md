Oh, the weight of His glory
Oh, the wonder of His grace
The power of salvation
Oh, that pulled me from the grave
This hope is not empty
And forever He will reign
And He won't be put to shame
And oh my soul
Sing to the God of the ages
Sing to the Lord of creation
Sing His praise again
And oh my soul
Sing like the heavens are waiting
Roar like an army of angels
Sing His praise again
From the moment of rescue
I have never been the same
When His love took me captive
And my sin was washed away
Now I stand here forgiven
And I know that I am saved
And I won't be put to shame
And oh my soul
Sing to the God of the ages
Sing to the Lord of creation
Sing His praise again
Oh my soul
Sing like the heavens are waiting
Roar like an army of angels
Sing His praise again
