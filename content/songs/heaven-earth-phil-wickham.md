[Intro]
Oh, oh-yeah, yeah
This is the line we're choosing now to cross
Between Heaven and Earth, Heaven and Earth
You're wiping away the tears that start to drop
From my face, from my face
I'm climbing the fences
I'm crossing the sea
I'll cover the distance
I just want You to shine on me (Shine on me)
My beating heart is bursting out my skin
To go further up and further in
Whatever it takes to bring me somewhere higher
Be it rain or be it fire
I'm climbing the fences
I'm crossing the sea
I'll cover the distance
I just want You to shine on me
I'm laying down my life
'Cause I know what You're worth
I'm crossing the great line
Between Heaven and Earth
Between Heaven and Earth
