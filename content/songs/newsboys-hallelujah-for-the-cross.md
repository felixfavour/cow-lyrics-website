Up to the hill of Calvary
My Saviour went courageously
And there he bled and died for me, Hallelujah for the cross
And on that day the world was changed
A final, perfect lamb was slain
Let earth and heaven now proclaim, Hallelujah for the cross
Hallelujah for the war He fought
Love has won, death has lost
Hallelujah for the souls He bought
Hallelujah for the cross
What good I have done could never save
My debt too great for deeds to pay
But God, my Saviour, made a way, Hallelujah for the cross
A slave to sin, my life was bound
But all my chains fell to the ground
When Jesus' blood came flowing down, Hallelujah for the cross
Hallelujah for the war He fought
Love has won, death has lost
Hallelujah for the souls He bought
Hallelujah for the cross
Hallelujah... hallelujah
And when I breathe my final breath
I'll have no need to fear that rest
This hope will guide me into death
Hallelujah for the cross
Hallelujah for the war He fought
Love has won, death has lost
Hallelujah for the souls He bought
Hallelujah for the cross
Hallelujah for the war He fought
Love has won, death has lost
Hallelujah for the souls He bought
Hallelujah for the cross
Hallelujah for the cross
Hallelujah for the cross
