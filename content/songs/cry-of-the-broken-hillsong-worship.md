Lord, I come
Lord, I thank You
For Your love
For this grace divine
Love and mercy
Undeserving
You gave it all
The greatest sacrifice
You were wounded for my sin
You were bruised for all my shame
You were broken for my healing
Only by the cross I'm saved
You're the mender
Of the broken
To every outcast
A friend and comforter
I come boldly to Your presence
Lord, I bow before Your throne
You're my Healer, my Redeemer
You're my hope, my life, my all
