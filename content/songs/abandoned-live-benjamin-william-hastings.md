Something isn’t adding up
This wild exchange you offer us
I gave my worst, you gave your blood
Seems hard to believe
You’re telling me you chose the cross?
You’re telling me I’m worth that much?
Well, if that’s the measure of your love
How else would I sing but
[Chorus: Benjamin William Hastings, 
Brandon Lake
]
Completely, deeply, sold out sincerely, abandoned
I’m completely, freely, hands to the ceiling enamored
Oh, my one life endeavor
To match your surrender
To mirror not my will but yours
Oh I’m completely, deeply, don’t care who sees me abandoned
Oh I surrender all (
Oh
)
I just can’t get over it
What kind of self control is this
You had angels at your fingertips
But on the cross you remained, yeah
