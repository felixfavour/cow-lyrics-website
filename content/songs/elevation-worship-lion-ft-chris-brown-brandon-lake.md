God of Jacob, Great I Am
King of Angels, Son of Man
Voice of many waters
Song of Heaven's throne
Louder than the thunder
Make Your glory known
Hail, hail
Lion of Judah
Let the lion roar
Hail, hail
Lion of Judah
Let the lion roar
Hail, hail
Lion of Judah
Let the lion roar
Hail, hail
Lion of Judah
Let the lion roar
Roar (roar)
Roar (roar)
Roar (roar)
Pride of Zion, prophets spoke
Our Messiah, flesh and bone
You alone are worthy
To open up the Scroll
Like the lamb, You suffered
But the Lion has a roar
Hail, hail
Lion of Judah
Let the lion roar
Hail, hail
Lion of Judah
Let the lion roar
Hail, hail
Lion of Judah
Let the lion roar
Hail, hail
Lion of Judah
Let the lion roar
Roar (roar)
Roar (roar)
Roar (roar)
Roar
