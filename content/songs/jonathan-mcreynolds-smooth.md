He's an on time God
Yes He is (hmm oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh on time God, yes He is (yes He is)
Oh, they say Job said
"He may not come when you want Him" (hey)
"But I know He'll be there" "be there right on time)
Tell you He's an
On time God
On time God
On time God (yeah)
On time God
Pull up when I need Him to
Nothing that He wouldn't do
Knowing I don't have a lot
He can use whatever I got, mmhmm
Oh, He always got a plan, nah
He don't never let it get too out of hand, nah
And I know He's got the whole world in His hands
He be doing things that I don't understand
I've been in my word, He in His bag
Know that it's gon' work, that's a fact
God be on that smooth timing
Coming, coming through
I've been doing work in my bag
Know that it might hurt but it lasts
God be on that smooth timing
Coming, coming through right on time
Oh, Lord (oh-oh)
When I need a light up on my path
Call Him from wherever I be at
Alpha, Omega, He the first and He the last
So I don't have to worry 'bout the past
No, no, no I ain't got the password (password)
He said that it's mine if I ask for it
Only moving forward, never backwards
Something's gonna change
I've been in my word, He in His bag
Know that it's gon' work, that's a fact
God be on that smooth timing (coming)
Coming, coming through
I've been doing work in my bag
Know that it might hurt but it lasts
'Cause God be on that smooth timing
Coming, coming through right on time
