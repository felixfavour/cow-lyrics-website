A thousand generations
Falling down in worship
To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
And all who've gone before us
And all who will believe
Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
Your Name is the highest
Your Name is greatest
Your Name stands above them all
All thrones and dominions
All powers and positions
Your Name stands above them all
And the angels cry Holy
All creation cries Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy forever!
If you've been forgiven
And if you've been redeemed
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
And if you walk in freedom
If you bear His name
Sing the song forever to the Lamb
Sing the forever and Amen
All the angels cry Holy
All creation cry Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy forever!
Hear Your people sing, Holy
To the King of Kings, Holy
And you will always be Holy
Holy forever!
Oh 'cause Your Name is the highest
Your Name is the greatest
Your Name stands above them all
Above all thrones and dominions
And all powers and positions
Your Name stands above them all
Oh Jesus
Your Name is the highest
Your Name is the greatest
Your Name oh stands above them all
Above all thrones and dominions
And all powers and positions
Your Name stands above them all
And the angels cry Holy
And all creation cry Holy
You are lifted high, Holy
Holy forever, hey!
Hear Your people sing Holy
To the King of Kings, Holy
And you will always be Holy
Holy forever
You will always be Holy
Holy forever
