[Intro]
That's what victory sounds like, too, right?
I just imagine just marching like
And God broadcasting our steps
Into the enemy's camp, you know what I'm saying?
We might have been walking softly at first
But then we start hearing the echo
Of these steps
What we don't know is that the enemy has already left
And there's like God saying, "You don't have to fight no more"The battle belongs to Jesus
The battle belongs to Jesus
You don't have to fight no more, fight no more
You don't have to fight no more, fight no more
You don't have to fight no more, fight no more
The battle belongs to Jesus
The victory is ours
Shout it, come on, say
You don't have to fight no more, fight no more ([?])
You don't have to fight no more, fight no more
You don't have to fight no more, fight no more
(The battle belongs to Jesus) The battle belongs to Jesus
(Victory) The victory is ours
You don't have to fight no more, fight no more
You don't have to fight no more, fight no more (You don't have to fight)
You don't have to fight no more, fight no more
The battle belongs to Jesus
The victory is ours
Victory is ours
