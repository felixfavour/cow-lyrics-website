New Music:  Nosa  Vanity
Chorus
Since them born me
(Since when)
And now I'm growing
(big boy)
I've never seen someone who loves me like this
I say since them born me
(Since when)
And now I'm growing
I've never seen a god way love me like my Daddy
Brother have you seen
No no no no
Since I was born
I have never eeh ever seen
My sister have you seen
No no no no
Since I was born
I have never eeh ever seen
Verse 2
Sans JéJesus, je serai sur le terrain à vendre de la verte
À manquer tout le temps du respect à ma mÃ¨re
Le péché aurait plu tout comme une averse
Sans JéJesus, j'aurai mal à la tÃªte à cause des gos
Ce qui m'aurait détruit c'est mon ego
Sans lui, j'aurai fini collabo
New Music:  Newsboys  I Still Believe You're Good
J'aurai fait les ballons
C'est Dieu qui a donné donc je pourrai jamais me venter de mon talent
Et moi j'ai mal aux talons
À force de trop cher-mar
Mais le Seigneur accordera du repos à tous ceux qui sont vaillants
Chorus
Since them born me
(Since when)
And now I'm growing
(big boy)
I've never seen someone who loves me like this
I say since them born me
(Since when)
And now I'm growing
I've never seen a god way love me like my Daddy
Brother have you seen
No no no no
Since I was born
I have never eeh ever seen
My sister have you seen
No no no no
Since I was born
I have never eeh ever seen
