If not for Your grace
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

If not for Your Love
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

If not for Your Mercy
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

If not for the Cross
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

If not for Your grace
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

If not for Your Love
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

If not for Your Mercy
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

If not for the Cross
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

No one understand
Where You brought me from

Now my life has changed
Jesus, See what You have done

I don't know why
And I don't know How
All I see say…

Miracle Everywhere
Miracle Everywhere

I don't know why
And I don't know How
All I see say…

Miracle Everywhere
Miracle Everywhere

If not for Your grace
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

If not for Your Love
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

If not for Your Mercy
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

If not for the Cross
Where would I be?
Where would I be?

No one understand
Where You brought me from

Now my life has changed
Jesus, See what You have done

I don't know why
And I don't know How
All I see say…

Miracle Everywhere
Miracle Everywhere

I don't know why
And I don't know How
All I see (say…)

Miracle Everywhere
Miracle Everywhere

Don't ask me why
Don't ask me how
All I See

Miracle Everywhere

Don't ask me why
Don't ask me how
All I See

Don't ask me why
Don't ask me how
All I See

No one understand
Where You brought me from

Now my life has changed
Jesus, See what You have done
