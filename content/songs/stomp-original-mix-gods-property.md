[Intro: Kirk]
For those of you that think that gospel music has gone too far
You think we got too radical with our message
Well I got news for you
You ain't heard nothin yet
And if you don't know, now you know
Glory, glory
Lately I've been goi-ng through some things that real-ly got me down
I need someone, somebody to help me, come and turn my life around
[Pre-Chorus]
I can't explain it
I can't obtain it
Jesus your love is so
It's so amazing
It gets me high
Up to the high
And when I think about Your goodness
It makes me wanna stomp
Makes me clap my hands
Makes me wanna dance and
Stomp
My brother can't you see
I got the victory
Stomp
