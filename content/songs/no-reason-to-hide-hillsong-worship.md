We've got nothing to lose
We've got no reason to hide
We've got the answer inside of us
It's time we took our disguises off
See Your glory revealed
See Your name lifted high
'Cause there is nobody else for us
Jesus you are the only one
You are alive and we are free
You are everything, everything we need
There's not a minute to waste
Not a second to lose
'Cause there's a city that waits for us
It's time to took all the lamp shades off
See Your glory revealed
See Your name lifted higher
'Cause there is nobody else for us
Jesus you are the only one
You are alive and we are free
You are everything, everything we need
Love has spoken and we believe
You are everything, everything we need
