[Intro]
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
If you curse me, then I will bless you
If you hurt me, I will forgive
And if you hate me, then I will love you
I choose the Jesus way
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
If you're helpless, I will defend you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
If you’re burdened, I'll share the weight (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And if you're hopeless, then let me show you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
There’s hope in the Jesus way
I follow Jesus, I follow Jesus
He wore my sin, I'll gladly wear His name
He is the treasure, He is the answer
Oh, I choose the Jesus way
If you strike me, I will embrace you
And if you chain me, I'll sing His praise
And if you kill me, my home is Heaven
For I choose the Jesus way
