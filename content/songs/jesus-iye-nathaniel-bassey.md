Jesus Iye
You have done it again
Jesus Iye
In your special way

What was impossible
You made possible
Jesus Iye

I almost gave up
When it seemed it was impossible
When the odds were up against me
And there was no way

It seemed all over
Then you spoke into the dry bones
And what was impossible
You made possible
Jesus Iye


I almost let go
When the violent storm was raging
And the night was long and lonely
It looked like, there was no hope

Then I cried out to You
And You spoke into the darkness
"Let there be light"

And what was impossible
You made possible
Jesus Iye
