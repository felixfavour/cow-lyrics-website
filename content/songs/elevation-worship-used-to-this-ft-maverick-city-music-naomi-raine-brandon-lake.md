USED TO THIS LYRICS
Time stands still whenever I'm with You
No more important place to go
There's no rush, not in a hurry
It's okay to take it slow
[Pre-Chorus: Naomi Raine]
Minutes turning into hours, doesn't really matter
I just want You
You're the only one I'm after, Spirit come in power
I just want You

Only You (All we want is You)
All we want is You (All we want is You)
Lord forgive me, I've been too busy
Trying to do this on my own
Your embrace is what I've been missing
I don't want to let it go
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Lake & Naomi Raine]
Minutes turning into hours, doesn't really matter
I just want You
You're the only one I'm after, Spirit come in power
I just want You
I just want You, I just want You
Nothing compares to You, nothing comes close
I just want You, I just want You
Nothing comparÐµs to You, nothing comes close
Nothing comes closÐµ (Nothing comes close to You)
(Nothing comes close to You)

If this is a glimpse of Heaven
I could get used to this, I could get used to this
The fragrance of Your presence
I could get used to this, I could get used to this
Oh, if this is a glimpse of Heaven
I could get used to this (I could), I could get used to this
Oh, the fragrance of Your presence
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this
If this is a glimpse of Heaven
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
The fragrance of Your presence (Your sweet presence)
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this
[Pre-Chorus: Brandon Lake & Naomi Raine]
Minutes turning into hours, doesn't really matter
'Cause I just want You
You're the only one I'm after, Spirit come in power
I just want You
(Say minutes turning into)
Minutes turning into hours, doesn't really matter
I just want You
You're the only one I'm after, Spirit come in power
I just want You (I just want You)
(I just want You)
I just want You, I just want You
Nothing compares to You, nothing comes close
I just want You (No one else)
I just want You (Nothing else will do)
Nothing compares to You, nothing comes close
[Outro: Brandon Lake & Naomi Raine]
Nothing
Nothing compares to You
Here in this moment
Where Your fragrance is all around
I could get used to (I could get used to this)
I could get used to this (I could get used to this)
No, there's nothing that compares
There's nothing like Your glory
And I could get used to (I could get used to this)
We want more of You, more of You (I could get used to this)
We love Your presence
I could get used to this, I could get used to this
