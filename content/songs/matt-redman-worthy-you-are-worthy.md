tt Redman - Worthy You Are Worthy
Worthy, You are worthy
Much more worthy than I know
I cannot imagine
Just how glorious You are
And I cannot begin to tell
How deep a love You bring
O Lord my ears have heard of You
But now my eyes have seen
You're worthy
You're worthy to be praised
Forever and a day
Glory, I give glory
To the One who saved my soul
You found me and You freed me
From the shame that was my own
How merciful You've been
O Lord, my ears had heard of You
We'll sing an anthem
of the highest praise
We'll sound an anthem
of Your glorious name
