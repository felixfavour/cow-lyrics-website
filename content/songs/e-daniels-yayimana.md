of what God has done

it is true he turned water to wine
he alone rose Lazarus from death
what man has a government on his shoulders
is born of a virgin
he's the lion and the lamb
he is glory, power and fire
the one who holds seven stars in his hands
he is glory, power and fire
the one who holds seven stars in his hands
