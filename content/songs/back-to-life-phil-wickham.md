I won't forget the moment I heard You call my name
Out of the grip of darkness and into the light of grace
Just like Lazarus, You brought me back to life
Where there was dead religion, now there is living faith
All of my hope and freedom, I found in Jesus' name
Just like Lazarus, You brought me back to life
No longer I who live, but Christ in me
For I've been born again, my heart is free
The hope of Heaven before me, the grave behind
Hallelujah, You brought mе back to life
When something says I am guilty, I'll point to thе price You paid
When something says I'm not worthy, I'll point to that empty grave
'Cause just like Lazarus, You brought me back to life
No longer I who live, but Christ in me
For I've been born again, my heart is free
The hope of Heaven before me, the grave behind
Hallelujah, You brought me back to life
