Righteous invasion of the truth

Righteous invasion of the truth

We've gat the spirit charging for
Righteous invasion of the truth
Time has come no no
Bow down as we come
We never giving up no no
Ya shield is bound to melt
When the back go, when the back goes down
Am the victory and the victory one
Praises till the dawn to Jesus
To be able he reigns
God cover his purpose and separated unto him
And all over his power to be free
There is no condemning us
We have been given unto him
From shackles, shames and sorrow we are free
Freeeeeeee
