I have Confidence in You,
Jesus
I have Confidence in You,
Savior
I have Confidence in You,
Any time, anywhere
I have Confidence in You,
When everybody let me down
When everybody let me down
I heard about Abraham
You never let him down
I heard about Shadrach,
Meshach and Abednego
You never let them down
And I heard about Daniel
In the Lion's Den, you showed up
After ninety years of Sarah barren
You gave her a Son
You gave her a Son
What about David, he said
In sin did my Mother conceive me
But you made him a King
Moving him from Wilderness
To the Palace
You pick messes
And you make it a Message
You always take trashes
And turn the into Treasures
Who am I, who am I
To doubt who you are
And Who am I, who am I
To doubt who you are
All I gotta do is this
My Confidence  Sonnie Badu Lyrics
I have Confidence in You,
