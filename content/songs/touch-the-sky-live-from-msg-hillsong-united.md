What fortune lies beyond the stars?
Those dazzling heights too vast to climb
I got so high to fall so far
But I found heaven as love swept low
My heart beating
My soul breathing, come on, you sing
I found my life
When I laid it down
Upward falling
Spirit soaring
I touch the sky
When my knees hit the ground
What treasure waits within Your scars?
This gift of freedom gold can't buy
I bought the world, come on, if you're thankful you sing
You traded heaven to have me again
My heart beating
My soul breathing
I found my life, come on
When I laid it down
Upward falling
Spirit soaring
I touch the sky
When my knees hit the ground
