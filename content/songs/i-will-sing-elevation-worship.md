When I wander in my doubt
I'm held within Your mystery
You reveal a love so faithful
Hope unending
I believe
You're the risen Son of God
You're the light that breaks the dark
Your love has rescued me
Forever I will sing
You're the Savior of my soul
You're the Name above it all
Your grace alive in me
Forever I will sing
Oh the wonder of the Cross
The Father's heart revealed to me
Unrelenting, never changing
All consuming, I am free
You're the risen Son of God
You're the light that breaks the dark
Your love has rescued me
Forever I will sing
You're the Savior of my soul
You're the Name above it all
Your grace alive in me
Forever I will sing
