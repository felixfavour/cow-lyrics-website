I was lost when You found me here
You pulled me close and held me near
And I'm a fool, but still You love
I'll be Your fool for the King of love
You gave me wings so I could fly
And gave me a song to color the sky
And all I have is all from You
And all I want is all of You
It's grace, Your grace (Your grace)
I'm nothing without You
Your grace, Your grace
Shines on me
And there've been days when I've walked away
Too much to carry, nothing left to say
Forgive me, Lord, when I'm weak and lost
For You traded Heaven for a wooden cross
And all these years You've carried me
You've been my eyes when I could not see
And beauty grows in the driving rain
Your oil of gladness in the times of pain
