Invading all my weakness
You wrapped me up in grace
The worst of me succeeded by the best of You
My heart is overtaken
My soul is overwhelmed
The worst of me succeeded by the best of You
My dreams have found their purpose
My future in Your hands
This life would have no meaning
If it weren't for You
[Pre-Chorus]
So I lay me down for kingdom come
Steel all that is within me
'Cause all I want in this world is more of You
In the less of me it is You
Increasing as I fade away
Your light for all the world to see
God it is You who breaks the chains
It is You who lights the way
And everything I am cries out for You
