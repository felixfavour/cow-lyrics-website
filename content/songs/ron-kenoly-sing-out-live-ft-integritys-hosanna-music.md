Sing out
The Lord is near
Build him a temple here
A palace of praise
A throne of thanksgiving
Made for the King of kings
Sing out a joyful song
His love goes on and on
When praises abound
His glory surrounds us
Build him a temple here
Sing out
The Lord is near
Sing out
The Lord is near
Build him a temple here
A palace of praise
A throne of thanksgiving
Made for the King of kings
Sing out a joyful song
His love goes on and on
When praises abound
His glory surrounds us
Build him a temple here
Sing out
The Lord is near
The Lord inhabits the
Song of His saints
And lives in their praises
The Lord inhabits the
Song of His saints
And lives in their praises
Sing out
The Lord is near
Build him a temple here
A palace of praise
A throne of thanksgiving
Made for the King of kings
Sing out a joyful song
His love goes on and on
When praises abound
His glory surrounds us
Build him a temple here
Sing out
The Lord is near
We come to worship
Together as one
With music and singing
Rejoice in all that the
Father has done
Let's lift up an offering
Sing out
The Lord is near
Build him a temple here
A palace of praise
A throne of thanksgiving
Made for the King of kings
Sing out a joyful song
His love goes on and on
When praises abound
His glory surrounds us
Build him a temple here
Sing out
The Lord is near
Sing out
Sing out
Sing out
The Lord is near
Build him a temple here
A palace of praise
A throne of thanksgiving
Made for the King of kings
Sing out a joyful song
His love goes on and on
When praises abound
His glory surrounds us
Build him a temple here
Build him a temple here
Build him a temple here
Sing out
The Lord is near
Sing out
