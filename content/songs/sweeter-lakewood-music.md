[Chorus]
Every day with You, Lord
Is sweeter than the day before
Every day with You, Lord
Is sweeter than the day before
Every morning I will worship
Every evening I'll adore
'Cause every day with You is sweeter
Sweeter than the day before
What a privilege to know You, like I know You
To be loved like You loved me
What an honor to worship, truly worship
From this heart that You have freed
From the rising of the sun
To the setting of the same
What a wonder to live life, really live life
Overcoming anything
What a reason to lift up, freely lift up
Every day my everything
From the rising of the sun
To the setting of the same
