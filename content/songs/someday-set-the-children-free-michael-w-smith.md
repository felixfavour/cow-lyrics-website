Words: David Mullen and Michael W. Smith
I know there's a prayer flowing from
The longing for the healing to come
Someday no more dark, aching nights
Someday I will open your eyes
The light will come and I will set you free
Sometimes there's a joy in the pain
Sometimes peace that can't be explained
Some find a longing there in their souls
Someday I will make all things whole
I promise to set the children free
Someday you'll find your place in the sun
Someday when all hearts beat as one
You'll sing with the heart of a child
Someday when the river runs wild
My Father comes to set His children free
Some say it's a vision
Some say it's just a dream
I say it's a promise
A covenant, a destiny
I will come to set my children free
