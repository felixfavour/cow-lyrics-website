I was young, and now I'm old
Seen a lot of situations unfold;
Been a lot of places
Met all kinds
But there's one thing that stays on my mind:
Out of all the things I've done
All the places I've gone
And the things I've seen
Chorus:
Said I never, seen the righteous forsaken (3x)
Nor His seed begging bread
Bridge:
You don't have to worry about a thing
If your holy and righteous
You don't have to worry about a thing
If your holy and righteous
Chorus
Vamp:
I never seen it!
