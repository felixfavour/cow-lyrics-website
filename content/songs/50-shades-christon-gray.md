Am I becoming more of what I never was?
I feel myself changing, I'm changing
Since the first day of school and such
Skipped study hall for extended lunch
Baby, is this the end of us?
Animaniacs, this is the suspended us
Wish I only had to ask for your forgiveness once
Wish I only had to ask for your forgiveness once
Can I get a witness, church
Call me Winston, downhill rolling bit the dust
See my queen on her own, I'm like I'll go dutch
And Julian has been my Uncle Dutch
Keeps a hundred dollar bill, no matter how I fill yep
Price is only getting higher, you can look but don't touch
He was saying I shouldn't be in a rush to add friends
We sort of like Mad Men, creative in the clutch
And he knows how I can be like 
Don Draper
 out to lunch
When my ego gets injured, I'll be looking for a crutch
Should be looking for an alter pleading for the blood
All day getting offers and even after dusk
I pray and I prey, seek while I hunt
I should've got off her they beat me to the punch
And It's gon' cost us, if we keep it on the hush
Wolves as sheep are quick to eat you up for dinner
Send you on your way sinner
Man I gotta watch who I'm amongst
Lord knows I'll be the first to announce my shame
Before you know my business though
First order of business bro
Please properly pronounce my name
