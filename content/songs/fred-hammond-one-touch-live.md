A father came to Jesus for his ailing daughter twelve years old.
Knowing if the Lord would lay his hands on her she would be made whole.
One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
Do you believe?
One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
That very moment a woman there, reached out her hand and clutched his robe.
And her issue of blood she had no more, that had come twelve years ago.
One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
Do you believe?
One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
Reach out and touch, the Lord is paing by.
Don't miss this precious moment, touch the Lord and be made whole.
One touch is all it takes
One touch is all it takes
Father, I stretch my hands to thee.
There is no other help I know.
As I touch your heart, please touch my life, and I will be made whole.
One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
Do you believe?
One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
Do you believe? One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
Reach out and touch, the Lord is paing by.
Don't miss this precious moment, touch the Lord and be made whole.
Reach out and touch, the Lord is paing by.
Don't miss this precious moment, touch the Lord and be made whole.
One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
Do you believe? One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
Reach out and touch, the Lord is paing by.
Don't miss this precious moment, touch the Lord and be made whole.
Reach out and touch, the Lord is paing by.
Don't miss this precious moment, touch the Lord and be made whole.
Touch the Lord and be made whole.
Touch the Lord and be made whole.
Touch the Lord and be made whole.
Do you believe that today?
Do you believe that today?
Just reach out and touch Him. Yes! Grab the human his garment. Whatever you can grab just grab and hold by faith.
One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
Do you believe it?
One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
One touch is all it takes to be made whole.
