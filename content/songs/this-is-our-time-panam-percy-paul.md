Lord I love You so much
And I want to always assure You
I know You said that I shouldn't swear
But a yes or a no
Cannot express what I want to say
Kings may be afraid to say it
Even Presidents
Pastors
Bishops
May be afraid to say it
But for You my Lord
I put my reputation on the line
And I say
I swear I will follow You
(I swear I will follow You)
I swear I will follow You
(I swear I will follow You)
My life is without a meaning without You lord
(I swear I will follow You)
This life is without a meaning without You lord
(I swear I will follow You)
If I won't follow You please let me die
(I swear I will follow You)
But I will follow You till the day I die
(I swear I will follow You)
(Say say)
I swear I will follow You
(I swear I will follow You)
I swear I will follow You
(I swear I will follow You)
My life is without a meaning without You lord
(I swear I will follow You)
This life is without a meaning without You lord
(I swear I will follow You)
If I won't follow You please let me die
(I swear I will follow You)
But I will follow You till the day I die
(I swear I will follow You)
What am I living for
When You are the source of my life
But to me Lord
You are sweeter than the honey
In the honeycomb
You are sweeter than the honey
In the honeycomb
You are sweeter than the honey
In the honeycomb
You are sweeter than the honey
In the honeycomb
I swear I will follow You
(I swear I will follow You)
I swear I will follow You
(I swear I will follow You)
My life is without a meaning without You lord
(I swear I will follow You)
This life is without a meaning without You lord
(I swear I will follow You)
If I won't follow You please let me die
(I swear I will follow You)
But I will follow You till the day I die
(I swear I will follow You)
I swear I will follow You Lord
(I swear I will follow You)
I swear I will follow You Lord
(I swear I will follow You)
I swear I will follow You Lord
(I swear I will follow You)
But to me Lord
You are sweeter than the honey
In the honeycomb
You are sweeter than the honey
In the honeycomb
You are sweeter than the honey
In the honeycomb
You are sweeter than the honey
In the honeycomb
I swear I will follow You
(I swear I will follow You)
