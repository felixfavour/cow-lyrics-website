[Chorus]
Jesus is Here
Everything I need is here
Jesus is Here
Everything I need is here
Come on can we sing this song all over the room
Jesus is Here, so everything
Everything I need is here
I want you to sing that with present awareness
Jesus is Here, so
Everything I need is here
No matter what you need tonight you donâ€™t have
Have to be anywhere else because Jesus is here
Jesus is Here, so
Everything I need is here
This Simple declaration will change your life
If you with me come on say it again say
Jesus is Here (if I am sick in my body everything he is the healer)
Everything I need is here
If I need salvation praise your redemption
So I am on my knees
