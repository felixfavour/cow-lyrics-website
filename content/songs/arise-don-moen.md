[Intro]
Arise, arise, arise, arise
Arise, take Your place
Be enthroned on our praise
One thing we ask of You
One thing that we desire
That as we worship You
Lord come and change our lives
Arise, arise, arise, arise
Arise, take Your place
Be enthroned on our praise, arise
King of kings, Holy God, as we sing arise
Arise, arise, arise
One thing we ask of You
One thing that we desire
That as we worship You
Lord come and change our lives
So arise, arise, arise, arise
Arise, take Your place
Be enthroned on our praise, arise
King of kings, Holy God, as we sing arise
Arise, arise, arise
