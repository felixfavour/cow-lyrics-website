Ooh, superstar
Never drove around in a fancy car
Kids looked at me funny
Momma she had no money but she always told me
"Baby, know who you are"I say ooh, don't you know
It was hard always wearing my cousin's clothes
Can you hand me down a dream
With those hand-me-down jeans?
Thought I'd never make, but I made it y'all, 'cause I had...
Jesus
When I had nothing, had to struggle, and was up to no good
Jesus
The reason I'm still breathing is 'cause
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
It's crazy how you love me even
When I don't love you like I should
Jesus
Jesus
Jesus
Ooh, look at me
I know I'm now all I'm supposed to be
I'm gonna get it right, didn't get here overnight
So while you're waiting please wait patiently
I say ooh, it's so sweet to know that you
Were always in love with me
Thought my game was clever, but no one can play me better than you
You know you always win cause you're
