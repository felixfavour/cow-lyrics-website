Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'T was grace that brought me safe, safe thus far
And grace will lead me home
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shinin' as the sun
We've no less days to sing, sing God's praise
Than when we first begun
So praise God, praise God
Praise God, praise God
Praise God, praise God, praise God
Praisе God, praise God
Praise God, praise God
Praisе God, praise God, praise God
(Hmm)
