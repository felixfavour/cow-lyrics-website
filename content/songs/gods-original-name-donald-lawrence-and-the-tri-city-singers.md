Moses had an encounter with God. And when he asked his name, he heard the wind. You see God chooses who he chooses, Moses
The last shall be first (the first shall be last)
Yo the back of the room is the (heavenly class)
[?] is the star of the cast
Your window is blurry ([?] glass)
[?]
Not feeling worthy to drink from the cup
The motion comes not from the east to west
It comes from the one who sings the last of the best
What is the lesson of this dancing song?
[?] call by the chosen, pick up the phone
