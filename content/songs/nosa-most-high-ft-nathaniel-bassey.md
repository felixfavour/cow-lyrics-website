Yeah, yeah, yeah
More precious than Sharon's roses, yes
You are the God of glory, yeah
The angels declare Your holiness
They cry halleluyah
You who are  ?? in Your ways
With You there are no mistakes, oh no
The works of Your hand declare Your grace
They say halleluyah
Adonai, You are the Most High
Elshadai, You are the Most High God
King on high, You are the Most High
We say halleluyah
Hmmm, ehhh, na na ehhh
The stars cannot match Your brightness, no
You give the sun its light
In You does my soul delights (Yes Lord)
Halleluyah
We join hosts of heaven (oh yeah, yeah)
Lifting our hands up high
We are  ??? before You
We cry halleluyah!
Adonai, You are the Most High
Elshadai, You are the Most High God
King on high, You are the Most High
We say halleluyah
Elshadai, You are the Most High
