hallelujah
All my life
from my birth
you've been wonderful
there is none, none so true, none so wonderful
I could search all over the world
and find no one wonderful
I've searched through 6,5,4,3
you're still too wonderful
my heart has to sing
hallelujah ohho
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
from all the folds that you have won
for serving God so true
remember this
if nothing else, you are wonderful
He makes me smile
He makes me laugh
this is why I never
why should I worry
when I have mr wonderful
oh lift your voice and sing
ha...lleluya
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah(lord thank you for everything)
ha...llelujah
oho
ha...llelujah
GOD can do it again and again
and again
He is the same God today
and always has been
yesterday and today
forever the same
there's no reason to doubt
for God can do it again
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah (Oh Jesus)
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
ha...llelujah
