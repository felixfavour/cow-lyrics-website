rse 1
What separate, separate me from the love of Christ
What can stand against, stand against the perfect law of life
Though the storms and oceans rise
Still on Him I'll fix my eyes
His every word my guiding light
Oh Oh oooo
I'm one with the Lord by covenant
And the peace
He will perfect what He began
Oh Oh ooo
So what shall we say to these things
Chorus
Eh eh a eh
If God be for me
Eh a eh
Verse 2
What can overturn, overturn the finished work of Christ
Who can lay a charge against the one that God has justified
Though I'm pressed on every side
There's a treasure deep inside
That the darkness cannot hide
Oh oh oohhhh
My boast, my hope, my joy I find (I find)
In the never-ending life
Christ in me, and I in Christ
Oh Oh ooooo
So what shall we say to these things
Bridge
(oh oh oh oh)
Ohoh nOh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
This is my testimony
This is my song
The king of Zion is for me, is for me
Not the highest height in life (oh oh oh oh)
Nor the darkest depth in hell (oh oh oh )
Can take away my confidence oh oh oh (oh oh oh oh)
