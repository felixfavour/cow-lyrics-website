This is how we dance

Argalliao

Where we come from

Argalliao

This is how we dance

Argalliao

We come from Zion

Argalliao

This is how we win

Argalliao

We win in Zion

Argalliao

This is how we rise

Argalliao

We rise in Zion

Argalliao

When the Lord turned

Argalliao

The captivity of Zion

Argalliao

It was like a dream

Argalliao

He filled our mouth

Argalliao

With singing, with singing

Argalliao

He filled our limbs

Argalliao

With dancing, with dancing

Argalliao

When the doctor say "NO"

Argalliao

We say "Argalliao"

Argalliao

When we see a mountain

Argalliao

We shout "Argalliao"

Argalliao

We laugh in the Holy ghost

Argalliao

We jump in the Holy ghost

Argalliao

Argalliao, Argalliao

Argalliao

Dance in the Holy ghost

(sounds play)

ah ah

ah ah
