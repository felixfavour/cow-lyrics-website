Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
Come on now
We live in a dream
If we really think
Everything's alright, yeah
This world is in need
Crying out to be freed
We gotta shed some light, oh
Teach the world to smile
(And hear angels sing)
Feel the breath of God
(And the power it brings)
It's time to come together, you and I
And share the love of Jesus Christ
