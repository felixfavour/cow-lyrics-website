We have come, as one heart, as one voice
To join heaven’s endless song on the earth
Lifting up our adoration towards Your throne
Praises rise, songs of love are now ascending
For the King, for the Lamb
Who gave His life to save us
Holy, Holy, Holy, all of Heaven cries
Worthy, Worthy, Worthy, for You were crucified
The living creatures call out
And all the elders fall down
A sacrifice of living praise, we bring our all
For You have beckoned us into a holy place
A holy love, Your very presence
And now we stand in wondrous awe
A glory cry we raise to Heaven
With holy hands and lifted hearts
Our eyes upon our Savior
Holy, Holy, Holy, all of Heaven cries
Worthy, Worthy, Worthy, for You were crucified
The living creatures call out
And all the elders fall down
They fall down
