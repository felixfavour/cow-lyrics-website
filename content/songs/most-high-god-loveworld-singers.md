Maker of all things by whom all things consist
The Word made flesh the Glory of the Father

Maker of all things by whom all things consist
The Word made flesh the Glory of the Father

Lord Jesus God of everything
The Way, the Truth and Life
In You there’s no shadow of turning

Lord Jesus the first begotten of the dead
The Prince of the Kings of the earth
You are the Most High God

The Word made flesh the Glory of the Father
