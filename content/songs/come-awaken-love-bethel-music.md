Like a fire in the night
Who’s flames reach and touch the sky
Burn within my soul and mind
‘Till all I see are Your eyes
Like the dawn takes back the light
Like Your Son brought back to life
Resurrect my soul’s desire
To burn again with true love’s fire
With true love’s fire
Lord God come awaken love
Come stir my soul to long for all You are
I’m desperate just to have more of Your heart
Come awaken love
Like a fire in the night
Who’s flames reach and touch the sky
Burn within my soul and mind
‘Till all I see are Your eyes
Like the dawn takes back the light
Like Your Son brought back to life
Resurrect my soul’s desire
To burn again with true love’s fire
With true love’s fire
