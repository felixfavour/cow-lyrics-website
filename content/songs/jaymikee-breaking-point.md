Everybody has those days when they are
Pushed to the wall like a picture frame
Or the times when they are
Pulled to the max like a rubber band at its breaking point
There's a power in the name of Jesus
There is victory in the blood
It doesn't matte what may come your way
I'm here to say that the battle is already won because nChorus
Every word we pray, every sound we're making
Every tear that falls, from all the cry and wailing
There is a God who will answer your prayers in time
If you trust in Him
Every wounded heart, every broken spirit,
Every situation, a still small voice will say
I am the God who will answer your prayers in time
If you rest in me.
When it seems like I am walking on my own
Or it seems like all my walls are crashing down
I will lift up my eyes to the mighty one
(Saying) Jesus Christ, son of God, Have mercy on me
