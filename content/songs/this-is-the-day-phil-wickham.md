Can you hear it, the gentle voice of the Spirit?
There's no reason to fear it, He's calling you to life
Just surrender, run into the arms of the Father
The night is finally over, take a step into the light
This is the day when the lost are found
This is the day for a new beginning
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
Oh, can you hear? All the angels are singing
This is the day, the day when life begins
Can you see it? A light shines into the darkness
Bringing hope to the hopeless, it's leading you to life
This is the day when all your sins are washed away
In the waves of His unending grace
Forever you're alive
This is the day when the lost are found
This is the day for a new beginning
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
Oh, can you hear? All the angels are singing
This is the day, the day when life begins
