E don tee wey you dey cry
My brother, my Sister
5 O'clock in the morning
And here you are
All alone
Brother you've been so worried
You don't know what to do (oh no)
But I know someone who can help you
If only you will believe (oh yeah)
The sun will shine in the morning
And darkness will go away(oh yeah)
So Ada ah ah
Don't cry, Don't cry-y-y-y
Oh oh

Wipe off your tears
Lift up your eyes
For the Glory and the lifter of your shame
Has come to take the burden off your heart
Ada ah ah
Don't cry, Don't cry
Don't cry-y-y-y
