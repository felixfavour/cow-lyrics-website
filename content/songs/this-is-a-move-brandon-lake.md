Mountains are still being moved
Strongholds are still being loosed
God, we believe it, yes, we can see that
Wonders are still what You do
We are here for You
Come and do what You do
We are here for You
Come and do what You do
Set our hearts on You
Come and do what You do
'Cause we need a move
We need a move
And bodies are still being raised
And giants are still being slayed
God, we believe it, and yes, we can see that
Wonders are still what You do
We are here for You
Come and do what You do
We are here for You
Come and do what You do
Set our hearts on You
Come and do what You do
'Cause we need a move
We need a move
