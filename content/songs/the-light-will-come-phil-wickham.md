To the one with the wounded heart
The years of fighting have left you scarred
Wait, the light will come
[Pre-Chorus]
To the one with distant eyes, all this crying has left you dry
Wait, the light will come
Wait, the light will come
Lift your eyes, the sun has overcome the night
Come alive as we shine in love's true light
Ooh, here is laughter beyond the tears
Here is courage to face your fears
Look, the light has come
[Pre-Chorus]
So rise, you daughters, and stand, you sons
Claim the victory that Jesus won
Look, the light has come
Look, the light has come
Lift your eyes, the sun has overcome the night
Come alive as we shine in love's true light, ooh, ooh
Lift your eyes, the sun has overcome the night
Come alive as we shine in love's true light, whoa, mm
