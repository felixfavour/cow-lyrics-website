Jaymikee ft. Snatcha  Revolution Lyrics
Eh Aha Eh ah ah
Eh ah Eh ah ah
chorus
Let the light shine upon everyone in darkness
To save us from the sin
Let it cover all of time regardless of what we resist
It is high time for a brand new revolution
The rising of a new dawn
The rising of a new dawn
So we claim what belongs to us
For the longest time the battle between darkness and light has been all around
See this is no ordinary fight
But this time around we say enough is enough
in the name that is above all name We move
We speak the holy word of God line by line
For the manifestation of the light to shine
No power ever stop us
dont even try to hold us
For all the powers and principalities are lowered
chorus
        Let the light shine upon everyone in darkness
        To save us from the sin
    Let it cover all of time regardless of what we   resist
 It is high time for a brand new revolution
       The rising of a new dawn
      The rising of a new dawn
      So we claim what belongs to us
We nor easy kill us
Even though we dey prophetic
Our weapons are not canal
We don't do this for the profit
Daily daily beholding, daily daily becoming
holy is what we declaring
I know it's really getting darker but it aint nothing
we are in the light
Like say dem open curtain
Eh Aha Eh ah ah
Like say dem open curtain
Eh Aha Eh ah ah
Eh ah Eh ah ah
chorus
Let the light shine upon everyone in darkness
To save us from the sin
Let it cover all of time regardless of what we resist
It is high time for a brand new revolution
The rising of a new dawn
The rising of a new dawn
The rising of a new dawn
So we claim what belongs to us
we blast through the borders And bring down the old order
we establish the kingdom of God in all the four corners of the earth
nothing shall remain the same We are changing the game
And at the mention of his name his inevitable the battle is already won
