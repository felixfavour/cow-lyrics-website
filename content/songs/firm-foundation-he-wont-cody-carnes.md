[Chorus]
Christ is my firm foundation
The Rock on which I stand
When everything around me is shaking
I've never been more glad
That I put my faith in Jesus
'Cause He's never let me down
He's faithful through generations
So why would He fail now?
He won't
He won't
I've still got joy in chaos
I've got peace that makes no sense
So I won't be going under
I'm not held by my own strength
'Cause I build my life on Jesus
He's never let me down
He's faithful in еvery season
So why would He fail now?
[Refrain]
Hе won't
He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail
He won't
No, no, no, no
He won't
He won't fail
He won't fail
