You paid the price, the highest price
I'm so grateful for Your love
You took my place and now I stand
To be called Your very own
He paid the price, the highest price
And I'm so grateful for Your love
Lord, You took my place
Thank You Jesus! And now I stand
To be called Your very own
Because You live, Jesus I live
I have no fear of what tomorrow brings
Because You live, Jesus I live today
I live to praise Your name
Wave your hands to Jesus
Hallelujah
