Singin' Majesty
Majesty
Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty handed but alive in Your hands
We're singing, Majesty
We're singing, Majesty
Forever, forever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your Majesty
We're singing Majesty, Majesty
Your grace, Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty handed but alive in Your hands
We're singing Majesty, Majesty
Forever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your Majesty
Majesty
Majesty, Majesty
Your grace, Your grace has found me just as I am
Empty handed but alive in Your hands
Majesty, Majesty
Forever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your Majesty
