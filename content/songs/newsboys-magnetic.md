As soon as open up my eyes
It's the same voice on the inside
Already so heavy
Weighing on my soul
All the fear all the worry
All the heartache all the hurting
Colliding
With your light and
Trying to steal my hope
Some days I break
I lose my way
More doubt than faith
But every time
I'm in that fight
Your love keeps pulling me back
Pulling me back
It's magnetic (it's magnetic)
I've pushed away
But I can't escape
Your love keeps pulling me back
Pulling me back
It's magnetic (it's magnetic)
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
It's magnetic (it's magnetic)
Your goodness won't give up on me
It's a fountain flowing so deep
You're so patient
And so gracious
It's unconditional
Even when try to go my own way
Even when my heart is in the wrong place
You bring it back around like a boomerang
Just like a boomerang
'Cause every time
I'm in that fight
Your love keeps pulling me back
Pulling me back
It's magnetic (it's magnetic)
I've pushed away
But I can't escape
Your love keeps pulling me back
Pulling me back
It's magnetic (it's magnetic)
Woo-ooh, woo-ooh, woo-ooh
It's magnetic (it's magnetic)
Like gravity
Just when I think that I'm outta reach
Your love your mercy keep pulling me
Pulling me
Oh can feel it, feel it, feel it
It's changing me
No more searching, it's clear to see
Everything that I used to be
Is history, I can feel it, feel it, feel it
Yeah, every time
I'm in that fight
Your love keeps pulling me back
Pulling me back
It's magnetic (it's magnetic)
I've tried to push away
But I can't escape
Your love keeps pulling me back
Pulling me back
It's magnetic (it's magnetic)
Your love keeps pulling me
It's magnetic (it's magnetic)
Your love keeps pulling me
It's magnetic (it's magnetic)
Your love keeps pulling me
Your love keeps pulling me
Your love keeps pulling me
Your love keeps pulling me
