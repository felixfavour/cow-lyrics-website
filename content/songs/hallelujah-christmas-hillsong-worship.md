He is here
The Savior has been born
The one we've waited for
Surrounded by our praises
He is here
The promise of the king
To You our lives we bring
Let your glory be revealed
Joy to the World
Peace to all who love Him
The savior has been born
And all the heavens smile
Glory to God
We bring an offering to You
Join with all the angels
Singing Hallelujah
He is here
The Savior has been born
The one we've waited for
Surrounded by our praises
He is here
The promise of the king
To You our lives we bring
Let your glory be revealed
