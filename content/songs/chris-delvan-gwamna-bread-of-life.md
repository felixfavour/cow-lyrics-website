There is a light that I see;
In spite of the darkness that surrounds me
And the Light that I see;
Only comes alive every time I hear your voice.
There is a Joy that I have;
Inspite of the sorrow that surrounds me;
And the Joy that I have;
Only comes alive every time I hear you voice;
There's a peace deep down in my soul;
In spite of the crises that surrounds me
And the peace living in my soul;
Only comes alive every time I hear your voice
ShuShuuduShurudu Shururudu ShuduShuruduruduruduShubidubidu shudu Shubidu Shurudurudurudu shudu shurudu;
There is a hope I have in me;
In spite of the destruction that surrounds me
And the hope deep within;
Only comes alive every time I hear your voice;
There's a call that I hear;
In spite of the destructions that surrounds me;
And the call that I hear;
Only comes alive every time I hear your voice;
There is a rest that I see;
In spite of the terror that surrounds me
And the rest that I see;
Only comes alive every time I hear your voice;
ShuShuuduShurudu Shururudu ShuduShuruduruduruduShubidubidu shudu Shubidu Shurudurudurudu shudu shurudu;
I can't deny  u00e2¦ u00e2¦ u00e2¦ u00e2¦.
So I declare;
That nothing can satisfy u00e2¦ u00e2¦me
I can't pretend; u00e2¦ u00e2¦ u00e2¦
Not to be aware;
That you are the bread of life
