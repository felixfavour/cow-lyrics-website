Sometimes I fall to my knees and pray
Come Jesus come
Let today be the day
Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna break
But I'm holding on
To a hope that won't fade
Come Jesus come
We've been waiting so long
For the day You return
To heal every hurt
And right every wrong
We need You right now
Come and turn this around
Deep down I know
This world isn't home
Come Jesus come
There'll be no war
And there'll be no chains
When Jesus comes
Let today be the day
He'll come for the weak
And the strong just the same
And all will believe
In the power of His name
Come Jesus come
We've been waiting so long
For the day You return
To heal every hurt
And right every wrong
We need You right now
Come and turn this around (turn this around)
Deep down I know
This world isn't home
Come Jesus come
Come Jesus come
One day He'll come
And we'll stand face to face
Come and lay it all down
Cause it might be today
The time is right now
There's no need to wait
Your past will be wash by rivers of grace
Come Jesus come
We've been waiting so long
For the day You return
To heal every hurt
And right every wrong
We need You right now
Come and turn this around (turn this around)
Deep down I know
This world isn't home
Come Jesus come
Come Jesus come
Come Jesus come
