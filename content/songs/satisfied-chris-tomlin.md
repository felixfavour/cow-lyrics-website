[Intro]
I count my blessings one by one
Your goodness in my life
How could I ask for more?
In You, I'm satisfied
All the mountains that I ascend
They leave me empty time and time again
I fix my eyes on this reward
The world behind me now and You before
I count my blessings one by one
Your goodness in my life
How could I ask for more?
In You, I'm satisfied
If You are all I have
I know that I will find
That You are all I need
In You, I'm satisfied
So let my life be freely spent
For what only, only You can give
My richest gain I count as loss
When I survey the wonder of the cross
