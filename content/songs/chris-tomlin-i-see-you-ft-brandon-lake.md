God of love
God of all glory
Every day I see new mercy
Great is Your faithfulness
God of love
God of my story
You never fail
You never forsake me
Great is Your faithfulness
I see You in the morning light
I feel You in the fire by night
I hear You say, "Child, I am with you.
Everything will be alright."
I see You in the tears that run
I feel You when the healing comes
I hear You say, "Beloved one, I am with you."
Every moment of my life
I see You
I see You
I see You
God, I see You
God of love
God of new vision
Every blessing You have given
Great is Your faithfulness
Oh how great is Your faithfulness
I see You in the morning light
I feel You in the fire by night
I hear You say, "Child, I am with you.
Everything will be alright."
I see You in the tears that run
I feel You when the healing comes
I hear You say, "Beloved one, I am with you."
Every moment of my life
I see You
I see You
I see You
God, I see You
I will worship through the storm
Through the storm
Through the storm
All my hope is in You Lord
In You Lord
In You Lord
I will worship through the storm
Through the storm
Through the storm
All my hope is in You Lord
In You Lord
In You Lord
I see You in the morning light
I feel You in the fire by night
I hear You say, "Child, I am with you.
Everything will be alright."
I see You in the morning light
I feel You in the fire by night
I hear You say, "Child, I am with you.
Everything will be alright."
I see You in the tears that run
I feel You when the healing comes
I hear You say, "Beloved one, I am with you."
Every moment of my life
I see You
I see You
I see You
God, I see You
I see You
I see You

God, I see You.
