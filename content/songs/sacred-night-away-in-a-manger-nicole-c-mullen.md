Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus lay down His sweet head
The stars in the sky look down where He lay
But little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay
Oh, what a sacred night, the stars were shinin' bright
The angels sing it loudly, the Savior has arrived
Their music filled the skies, oh, what a lullaby
To announce the new born baby to people far and nigh
And they cried glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory
Glory, glory, glory to the Lord God on high
All the angels sang glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory
Glory, glory, glory to the Lord God on high
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love Thee Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh
Oh, what a sacred night, the stars are shinin' bright
Angels sing it loudly, the Savior has arrived
Their music fill the skies, oh, what a lullaby
To announce the new born baby to people far and nigh
