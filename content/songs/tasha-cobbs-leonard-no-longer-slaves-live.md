I am no longer a slave to fear
For I am child  a God 2*
 You unravel me with your melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance
From my enemies till all my fears are gone
I am no longer a slave to fear
For I am child of God
From my mother womb
You have chosen me
Your love has called my name
I've being born again
Into your family
Your blood flows through my viens
OH OH OH OH OH OH
