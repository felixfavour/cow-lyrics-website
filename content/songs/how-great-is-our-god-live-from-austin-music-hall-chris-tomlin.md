The splendor of the King
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice
He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
It trembles at His voice
Trembles at His voice
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God and all will see
How great, how great is our God
Age to age, He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end
The Godhead Three in One
Father, Spirit, Son
Lion and the Lamb
Lion and the Lamb
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God and all will see
How great, how great is our God
(How great is our God, sing with me)
Name above all names
(How great is our God and all will see)
Worthy of our praise
(How great, how great is our God)
My heart will sing
How great is our God
(How great is our God, sing with me)
Name above all names
(How great is our God and all will see)
Worthy of our praise
(How great, how great is our God)
My heart will sing
How great is our God
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God and all will see
How great, how great is our God
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God and all will see
How great, how great is our God
How great is our God, sing with me
How great is our God and all will see
How great, how great is our God
