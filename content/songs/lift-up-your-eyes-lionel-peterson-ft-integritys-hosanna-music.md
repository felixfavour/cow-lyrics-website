Why are we weighed down can we see no solution
Why don't we look up to the hope of our salvation
Can we see that our God is faithful
Yesterday today forever
Let every tribe and every tongue
Come to the Son who's born
Those who call on Him 
He has promised to save

Come let us praise
Lift up your eyes to the Lord
Come let us praise
Lift up your eyes to the Lord

Lift up your eyes lift up your voice
Lift up your heart for in His love we can rejoice x2 

Can we see that our God is faithful
Yesterday today forever
Let every tribe and every tongue
Come to the Son who's born
Those who call on Him 
He has promised to save 

Come let us praise
Lift up your eyes to the Lord
Come let us praise
Lift up your eyes to the Lord

Lift up your eyes lift up your voice
Lift up your heart for in His love we can rejoice (REPEAT) 

Come let us praise
Lift up your eyes to the Lord
Come let us praise
Lift up your heart for in His love we can rejoice
