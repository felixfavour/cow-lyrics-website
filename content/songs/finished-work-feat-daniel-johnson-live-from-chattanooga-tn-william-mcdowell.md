Everything that I'll ever need
Was accomplished on Calvary
My sins are gone, no more shame holding me
That's what You have done for me
Everything that I'll ever need
Was accomplished on Calvary
My sins are gone, no more shame holding me
That's what You have done for me
Wake up my soul and live in the promises
My hope is built on every word He said
He said
The work is finished
Everything you've promised me is already done
Yes, we've already won
The work is finished
Everything you've promised me is already done
So I'm resting in the finished work
Now I believe
And now I receive
By faith it is happening
I'm already healed, I'm already free
That's what you have done for me
