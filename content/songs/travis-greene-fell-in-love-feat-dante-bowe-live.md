On the edge, of a cliff
Nothing below but tragedy
At the end, of my sins
Nowhere to go
But thou found here
I feel the weight
I feel the turn
Of my sins
And gravity keeps pulling me down
And I deserve it
But your hand of your brother came in like
Love
Fell in love
Love
Fell in love
Fell in love
What is like
Nothing is right
Take a look, no fantasy
In my world, in this life
Nowhere to go but thou found here
I feel the weight
I feel the touch
Of my sin
And gravity keeps pulling me down
Oh I deserve it
But the hand of the cross
Fell in love
Fell in love
Fell in love (I fell in your grace)
Fell in love (fell in your mercy)
Fell in love (and I thought it was over)
...
Oh no no no no...
So glad no matter what I've gone through
No matter what I've done
You've been a consistent God
Through it all
Yeah, I'm so glad that you hear me now
You see me now
I believe you are still in love with me
Through it it all (you hear me now)
You see me now (you see me now)
I believe you're satisfied with me
...
Love
Fell in love
Now I believe you are still in love with me
