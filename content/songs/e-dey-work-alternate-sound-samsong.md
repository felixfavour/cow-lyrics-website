 It's the Church Boy, Samsong
Church Boy
… The word of God in my mouth (e dey work)
The Spirit of the Lord in my heart (e dey work)
When I speak in tongues (e dey work)
Even my tithe and offering (e dey work)
The Name of Jesus in my mouth (e dey work)
E dey work, e dey work (e dey work)
You say "e dey work" (e dey work)
E dey work, e dey work (e dey work)
… People living life in a fool's paradise
Living life like a toss a dice
Brother, if e no work for your side
E don't mean what we do is a lie, ehn
Talk about my tithe and my offering
I pay my tithe put an end to the suffering
My life be turnioniown
You say, turnioniown
… Don't talk down on the anointing
Small talk can bring you down to nothing
What you don't understand, leave it
Makes no sense to still take a stand
… This is our life, our culture
We are from the Commonwealth of Zion
We live by a different set of rules
This is what we do, and this is how we rule
… The word of God in my mouth (e dey work)
The Spirit of the Lord in my heart (e dey work)
When I speak in tongues (e dey work)
Even my tithe and offering (e dey work)
The Name of Jesus in my mouth (e dey work)
E dey work, e dey work (e dey work)
You say "e dey work" (e dey work)
E dey work, e dey work (e dey work)
… I say e dey work o
E dey work o
I say e dey work o
… Keep saying it don't stop talking it
A closed mouth is a closed up destiny
Quiet Christians die quietly
If you must live right only say the right things
Ha, kabaye, kabaye
"Bros you de speak in tongues?"
Calm down this na my secret
Na the power and the glory of Christianity
When I speak in tongues there'll be nay circumstances
Speak in tongues move all that mountain
When I speak in tongues I change situations
Speak in tongues put the Devil in confusion
… This is our life, our culture
We are from Commonwealth of Zion
We live by a different set of rules
This is what we do, and this is how we rule
… The word of God in my mouth (e dey work)
The Spirit of the Lord in my heart (e dey work)
When I speak in tongues (e dey work)
Even my tithe and offering (e dey work)
The Name of Jesus in my mouth (e dey work)
E dey work, e dey work (e dey work)
You say "e dey work" (e dey work)
E dey work, e dey work (e dey work)
… I say e dey work o
E dey work o
I say e dey work o
… If you want your life to take a new turn
All you need to do is say this words after me, say
… Lord I believe in You and I receive
The power to become the son of God
Lord I believe in You and I receive
The power to become the son of God
… The word of God in my mouth (e dey work)
The Spirit of the Lord in my heart (e dey work)
When I speak in tongues (e dey work)
Even my tithe and offering (e dey work)
The Name of Jesus in my mouth (e dey work)
E dey work, e dey work (e dey work)
You say "e dey work" (e dey work)
E dey work, e dey work (e dey work)
… I say e dey work o
E dey work o
I say e dey work o
E dey work o
I say e dey work o
E dey work o
I say e dey work o
