Sweeter than the morning
Or the sound of the rain
From the mouth of the preacher
And the sinner the same
Tender as a whisper
But loud in its refrain
May it hang on my lips for the rest of my days
There is something about the name of Jesus
It sounds like forgiveness, sounds like amazing grace
It beckons my soul to sing forever
There's just something about that name
We pray it over family
When we rise and when we sleep
We speak it over sorrow
And the soul is given peace
We'll sing it in the famine
Or in prosperity
May we never forget
That He is all that we need
There is something about the name of Jesus
It sounds like forgiveness, sounds like amazing grace
It beckons my soul to sing forever
There's just something about that name
There is still no other name
You still have the power to save
You can empty any grave
Forever Jesus, it's Your name
There is something about the name of Jesus
It sounds like forgiveness, sounds like amazing grace
It beckons my soul to sing forever
There's just something about that name
There's just something about that name
