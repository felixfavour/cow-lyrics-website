Verse
Whom have I in heaven but You
There is nothing on earth I desire beside You
My heart and my strength many times they fail
But there is one truth that always will prevail
Chorus
God is the strength of my heart
God is the strength of my heart
God is the strength of my heart
And my portion forever, forever
(Repeat Verse)
(Repeat Chorus twice)
Forever, forever, forever.....
Forever
