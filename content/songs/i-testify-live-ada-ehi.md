For the Lord himself is my portion
He lifts my head in glory
For my horn the Lord has exalted
He teaches me to prosper
I have come with stories to tell
I have come with
Testimonies
Take a look at me you can see it
Say you can call me
Testimony
It is my time and it is my season
All around me
Testimonies
And because the Lord is my shepherd
I shall never want
Everyday, testimonies
Everywhere, testimonies
See the word is working
And am so full of praise
In the morning, testimonies
And in the evening, testimonies

Of how I overcame
