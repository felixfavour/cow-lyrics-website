They'll make a Netflix series about us
The kind where you cry and smile at the same time
All the reviews will call it a triumph
But darling, you and I just call it life
[Pre-Chorus]
Remember the time when I first held your hand on Ocean Avenue
And when we stayed up late on Empire State, couldn't keep my eyes off you
And those blurry eyes and cloudy skies when you first said "I do"Well, I do too, I do too, I do too
'Cause what we got is just too good
Just too good, just too good
What we got is just too good
Just too good, just too good
Remember when you said "I do"?
Well, I do too, well, I do too
'Cause what we got is just too good
Just too good, oh, it's just too good
A couple of suburb kids in the city
Watchin' the sunset fill the San Diego sky
Gave you a ring and made it holy
'Cause I can't imagine a life where you're not by my side
