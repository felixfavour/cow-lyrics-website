(Hmm hmmmn hmmn hmmmn)
These dry bones will rise again
Cos the stone has been rolled away
At the touch of living water
(Yeah yeah)
This broken branch will live again
(hmmm hmm hmmmuhh uhuh)
These fallen walls will be restored says the Lord
So hear his voice as He calls, come forth
Chorus
Arise, come alive
It’s not over, till Jehovah says it is
(yeah eee yeahhh )
Arise, come alive
Mighty soldier, you must fulfil your destiny
(Yeah eee yeahh ee)
Arise
These dry bones will rise again
(Yes they will, they will)
And the barren will sing again
(Dah ba da bi do da ba)
Out of the dust and from the ashes
(yeah yeah)
Will arise new life again
(Eh ee Eh ee, Eh eh)
That which was dead will live again
Says the Lord
So arise, take up your bed and walk yeah
That which was lost
I will restore, says The Lord
(I will restore)
So hear His voice as He calls, come forth
