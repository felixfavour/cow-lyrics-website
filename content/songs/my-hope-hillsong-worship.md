You are righteous, You love justice
And those who honour You will see Your face
[Pre-Chorus]
I will arise
And lift my eyes to see
Your majesty, Your holiness
All I am will bless You
My hope is in the name of the Lord
Where my help comes from
You're my strength, my song
My trust is in the name of the Lord
I will sing Your praise
You are faithful
You are righteous, You love justice
And those who honour You will see Your face
[Pre-Chorus]
I will arise
Lift my eyes
And lift my eyes to see
Your majesty, Your holiness
And all I am will bless You
