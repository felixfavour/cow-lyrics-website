I understand that you understand all that I go through
in the midst of the storm you dey carry me to through
you no go leeeave me, leave me lonely
so I belieeeve, believe you only
out of the dry land, say water just dey pour for me, (pour for me)
bad man, dem a gather,
all of them just dey fall for me
you no go leeeave me, leave me lonely
so I belieeeve, believe you only
You make me strong like a rock, I be Peteru (peteru)
You make me walk on water likee, Peteru (peteru)
Me I come bold Inna the place, I be Peteru (peteru)
Not gonna try to deny you likee, Peteru (peteru)
Hold me faced off
From a cliff, man I jumped off
but I never fell, ooh no
it was you all the way oh
even when I tried to let go
never touched down like a crop top
Now to him wey dey keep me from falling kept me from falling
every time I dey cast, na your Grace dey come pouring, Grace dey come pouring
and Na you I dey see for the end of the tunnel
and Na you I dey see for the end of the road
and Na you I dey see for the end of the tunnel
and Na you I dey see for the end of the road
 Peteru (peteru)
You make me walk on water likee, Peteru (peteru)
Me I come bold Inna the place, I be Peteru (peteru)
Not gonna try to deny you likee, Peteru (peteru)
You satisfy my soul
God make you take control
you make me more than gold
say make you take control
You satisfy my soul
say make you take control
you make me more than gold
God make you take control
Peteru (peteru)
You make me walk on water likee, Peteru (peteru)
Me I come bold Inna the place, I be Peteru (peteru)
Not gonna try to deny you likee, Peteru (peteru)
