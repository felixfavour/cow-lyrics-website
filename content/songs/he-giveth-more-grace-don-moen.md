He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater
He sendeth more strength when the labors increase
To added affliction He addeth His mercy
To multiplied trials His multiplied peace
His love has no limit
His grace has no measure
His pow'r has no boundary known unto men
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus
He giveth and giveth and giveth again
When we have exhaustеd our store of endurance
Whеn our strength has failed
Ere the day is half done
When we reach the end of our hoarded resources
Our Father's full giving is only begun
His love has no limit
His grace has no measure
His pow'r has no boundary known unto men
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus
He giveth and giveth and giveth again
