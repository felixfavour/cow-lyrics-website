May we never loose our wonder
May we never loose our wonder
Wide eyed mystified
 may we be just like a child
Staring at the beauty of our king
May we never loose our wonder
May we never loose our wonder
Ohhh...
Fill us with wonder
May we never loose our wonder
May we never loose our wonder
Wide eyed mystified
 may we be just like a child
Staring at the beauty of our king
Cause you are beautiful in all your ways
King of kings
Cause you are beautiful in all your ways
Ohhhh....
Just close your eyes, just close your eyes and sing it..
you are beautiful in all your ways
Open the eyes of our heart to see you God
May we never loose our wonder
Just sing that over yourself
May we never loose our wonder
Wide eyed mystified
 may we be just like a child
Staring at the beauty of our king
You're beautiful
You are beautiful in all your ways
Oh you are, yes you are
You are beautiful in all your ways
We give our lives to sing
Oh...you are beautiful in all your ways
Ohhh...cause you are beautiful in all your ways
Ohhhhhhhhhhh
You facilate me, you fascinate me, facilate us with your love (repeat)
Cause you are beautiful
You are glorious
You are beautiful...yes you are
You are beautiful
You are glorious
Ohhhhhh...you are beautiful
You are beautiful in all your ways
May we never loose our wonder
Wide eyed mystified,
May we be just like a child staring at the beauty of our king.
