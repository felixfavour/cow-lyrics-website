I heard the folks talk about the things you've done and would just laugh at what they say. Who would've thought in time that I'll be the one who would have thought that I'd get to know this way say would who would have thought that I'd get to know this way
Just like a shining light from out of the blue before I could waste my life away for you came and took my life and made it brand new who would've thought that get to know this way this way
I know you Lord since you've entered in I can't believe the things you've done you came and you save me change me and forgave me and then you took me in as one of your own
Now when I feel my world is fallen apart I could bend my knees and pray ( you know what) it feels so good to feel your love my heart (oh my) who would have that get to know you this way

Say I know him ( I know him for myself I don't need nobody else)
