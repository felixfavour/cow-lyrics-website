There's never been anyone like You, God
There's never been anyone like You, God
No one above You, no one beside You
There's never been anyone like You, God
There's never been anyone like You, God
There's never been anyone like You, God
You are the highest, You are the greatest
There's never been anyone like You, God
Yeshua, Jehovah
Hallelujah, glory in the highest
Yahweh, Your name is holy, holy, holy
God for us, God with us
King Jesus, Lord Almighty
Yahweh, Your name is holy, holy, holy
We praise Your name forevermore
We praise Your name forevermore
All tongues and all nations, let all generations
Sing praise to the name of the Lord our God
