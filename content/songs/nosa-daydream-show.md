en I'm drifting off
With my eyes wide open
I see all of the things
I'm not supposed to see
Paradise galore
With a sky I've chosen
Population of just you and me
Playing on record
We can watch our memories
Watching live
Can laugh at enemies
I'm watching live
I'm watching me
Daydream show
Play it slow, wanna know
What it's like
To have it all
In my show
On record, no awards
Golden scenes
Up on the silver screen
Waking up to love
And smiling in our sleep
Season one, it ends
We do the pilot again
Can never cancel us
Director never cuts
I'm watching live
You and me
Daydream show
Play it slow, wanna know
What it's like
To have it all
