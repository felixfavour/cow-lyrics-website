I surrender all, I surrender all
All to You I give
(x6)
(Spoken:)
Some of us are bowed down
Some of us with our hands lifted;
We present ourselves to You
Our lives, completely and totally
We surrender to You
And our answer, the word of agreement
Between heaven and earth is "yes."Whatever You want to do, Lord...
We say yes to You
(Sung, worship leader ad lib; repeat each line as needed:)
We say yes, we surrender
I say yes, I surrender
