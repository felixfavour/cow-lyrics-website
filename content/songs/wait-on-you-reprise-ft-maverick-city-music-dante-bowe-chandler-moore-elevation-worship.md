You get a little stronger
Stay right there because you get a little stronger
Get a little stronger

Oh, oh it's about what you do when you wait
Why complain
When you can praise?
Oh-oh-oh
It's not about just waiting
It's about what you're doing when you're waiting
So instead of complaining
Why don't we just start praising?
In the middle of the storm, yeah
In the middle of the storm, yeah, yeah, yeah
While I'm waiting I'll be praising
While I'm waiting I'll be praising
