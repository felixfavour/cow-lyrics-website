Every day, through the night
Yeah, You're everywhere I go
Every step You are there
In the valley of the shadow
I know I never walk alone, not even for a minute
Whatever I'm in, I know that we're in it
Together, together
Your mighty hands are holding me
Together, together
You're the God that never leaves
When life gets hard, we all need Jesus
We fall apart and You're putting the pieces
Together, together
Thank You, Lord, You hold all things together
Through the highs and the lows
And the bends in the road
Lord, I know whatever life brings
You're the calm in the storm and I know that
For my good You're working all things
Together, together
Your mighty hands are holding me
Together, together
You're the God that never leaves
When life gets hard, we all need Jesus
We fall apart and You're putting the pieces
Together, together
Thank You, Lord, You hold all things together
