There is love that is like no other
There is strength that will pull you through
There is God standing in your corner
There is nothing, nothing He can't do
There is grace that has no measure
There is mercy that has no end
There is life for you, there is joy and pleasure
There is God, He's your closest friend
There is, there is
There is, there is
There is, there is
(There's God)
There is, there is God
There is, there is
There is, there is
There is, there is
There is, there is God
There is hope for the brokenhearted
There is peace for the troubled soul
There is help for the one discarded
There is God that is control
There is hope for the brokenhearted
There is peace for the troubled soul
There is help for the one discarded
There is God that is control
There is, there is
There is, there is
There is, there is
There is, there is God
There is, there is
There is, there is
There is, there is
There is, there is God
He is, He is
He is, He is
He is, He is
He is, He is God
He is, He is
He is, He is
He is, He is
He is, He is God
(He is God!)
He is God
He is God
(Jehovah-jireh
Jehovah-jireh)
He is God
(He's the God that He is
He's the God that saves)
He is God
