I just want to be where You are
Dwelling daily in Your Presence
I don't want to worship from afar
Draw me near to where You are

I just want to be where You are
In Your dwelling Place forever
Take me to the Place where You are
I just want to be with You

I want to be where You are
Dwelling in Your Presence
Feasting at Your table
Surrounded by Your glory
In Your Presence
Thats where I always want to be
I just want to be
I just want to be with You

I just want to be where You are
In Your dwelling place forever
I don't want to worship from afar
Draw me near to where You are

Oh my God
You are my strength and my song
And when I'm in Your Presence
Though I'm weak
You're always strong

I just want to be where You are
Dwelling daily in Your Presence
I don't want to worship from afar
Draw me near to where You are

I just want to be where You are
In Your dwelling Place forever
Take me to the Place where You are
I just want to be with You

I just want to be where
I just want to be where
Wherever You are

I just want to be where
I just want to be where
You are

Where You are
Where You are
I want to be where You are
