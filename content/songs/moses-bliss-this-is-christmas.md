Merry christmas
I feel love in the air
I see joy everywhwre
Red caps on everyones head
No doubt this is christmas
The savior is born
To change the course of history
Now we live in constant victory
No better time to celebrate
No better time to show some love
No better time to give lives meaning
Jesus is here, this is chrimstmas
Lets celebrate, Jesus is here.
Jesus is here, this is chrimstmas
Lets celebrate, Jesus is here
