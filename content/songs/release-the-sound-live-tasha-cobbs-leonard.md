[Intro]
Hey!
Woo! Yeah, yeah, yeah
David faced a giant that mocked the living God
By faith he stood in power and that giant had to fall
The Israelite people rivaled by a wall
But when the people shouted that wall it had to fall
'Cause there is a sound (Woo!) that makes walls fall down, hey!
There is a sound, yeah, that makes walls fall down
There is a sound that makes walls fall down
I command you, release the sound (Heyy) Hey!
Release the sound (Hеyy)
Hey! You got it!
Releasе the sound (Heyy)
I got another one
What about Paul and Silas behind the prison walls
But when they started singing, those walls they had to fall
'Cause there is a sound that makes walls fall down, you got it!
Say there is a sound (There is a sound)
That makes walls fall down (That makes walls fall down)
There is a sound (There is a sound)
Makes walls fall down (That makes walls fall down)
Heyy, y'all (Release the sound) (Heyy)
You got it, release the sound (Release the sound) (Heyy)
Release the sound (Release the sound) (Heyy)
