Blessing, honor, strength, and power
Yours alone now and forever
Love this world could never stop
There is no one like our God
Reaching down to touch the broken
Mercy breaking through this moment
Faithful is the One who saves
Worthy is Your Name
Oh God, the glory is Yours
The Kingdom has come and the battle is over
Jesus, in Your Name we rise
And the glory is Yours, the glory is Yours
Thrones and angels watch in wonder
On that day when time is over
Every heart at last proclaim
Worthy is Your name
Oh God, the glory is Yours
The Kingdom has come and the battle is over
Jesus, in Your Name we rise
And the glory is Yours, the glory is Yours
