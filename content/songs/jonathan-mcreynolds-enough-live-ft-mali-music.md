I see the weary in your eyes
Work nights make you sick and tired
You're burning out trynna keep the fire
You think that if you do everything right
That God will see you in a different light
That's what you told yourself a million times
But He won't treat it like a nine to five
You don't have to earn this paycheck
Cause the love of God ain't like that
His heart is big enough
You will always be loved
You're already enough
You will always be loved
Stretching out trynna synchronize
Compromise after compromise
You hide your face with a good disguise
But when you're judging without His eyes
And you change for the people's likes
Do you, you don't recognize
Yeah, I hope that you realize
You don't have to fight to stay here
Here'sa home that's built on solid ground
See in the love of God, there's no fear
His heart is big enough
You will always be loved
You're already enough
You will always be loved
His heart is big enough
You will always be loved
You're already enough
You will always be loved
Even when your faith is shaking (You will always be loved)
Even when my heart is breaking (You will always be loved)
I don't care what IG's saying (You will always be loved)
Yeah
I know that his mercy's chasing me (You will always be loved)
Yeah
His heart is big enough
You will always be loved
You're already enough
You will always be loved
His heart is big enough
You will always be loved
You're already enough
You will always be loved
You're already enough
You will always be loved
You're already enough
You will always be loved
His heart is big enough
You will always be loved
You're already enough
You will always be loved
