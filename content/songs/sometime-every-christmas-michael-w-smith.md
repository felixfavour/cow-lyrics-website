1 I’M THINKING ABOUT THE HOLIDAY
AND THE SANDS OF TIME
YEARS PASS LIKE PAGES OF OLD FAMILY
PHOTOS IN MY MIND
FACES AND THE PLACES
HOW DECEMBERS USED TO BE
A LITTLE LONELINESS AND LONGING
IT RISES UP IN ME
Chorus:
SOMETIME EVERY CHRISTMAS
CAN’T SAY WHERE OR WHEN OR WHY
BUT SOME MOMENT OR SOME MEMORY
TAKES ME BY SURPRISE
AND SOMETHING IN THE SEASON
WELLS UP IN MY EYE
SOMETIME EVERY CHRISTMAS
I CRY
2 MIGHT BE SOME CHOIR OF CHILDREN
SINGING ‘SILENT NIGHT’
OR DRIVING THROUGH MY HOMETOWN SEEING
MAIN STREET DRESSED IN LIGHTS
