I am souled out, my mind is made up
I am souled out, my mind is made up
I am souled out, my mind is made up
I am souled out, my mind is made up
Who can separate us from the love Jesus
Not death, nor life
Jesus paid the price, now I'm free from sin
I am souled out, my mind is made up
I am souled out, my mind is made up
I've come through the fire
I've come through the rain
But God, he never left my side
He's my comfort through all hurt and pain
I am souled out
I am souled out
I am souled out
I am souled out
I am souled out
I am souled out
I am souled out
I am souled out
I am souled out
I am souled out
I am souled out
I am souled out
