You, are all I need
And where You lead me, I will follow
And, with all my heart
I give You praise
For life, for health and strength
For giving peace, in midst of sorrow
I, will lift my voice, and give You praise
Your love, that's sent from above
Has changed my night, into a thousand rainbows
And through, Your love I've found more strength
Than I've ever known
You are, my dwelling place
And where you lead me, I will follow
And through the cold, and through the storm, I will give you praise
Chorus:
Lord, You are, my dwelling place
My present, help
And for, these things I give, You praise;
For this I give You praise
