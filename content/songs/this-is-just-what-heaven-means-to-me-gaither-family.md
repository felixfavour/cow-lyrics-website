A country where no twilight shadows deepen. Unending days where night will never be. A city where no storm clouds cannot gather. Ohh, this is just what Heaven means to me!

What will twill be when we get over yonder, And join the throng upon the crystal sea!  To meet our loved ones and crown Christ forever. Oh, this is just what Heaven means to me!

A place where there is no misunderstanding and from all enmity and strife we're free. No unkind words that wound the heart are spoken. Now  this is just what Heaven means to me!

What will twill be when we get over yonder, And join the throng upon the crystal sea!  To meet our loved ones and crown Christ forever. Oh, this is just what Heaven means to me!

And when at last we see the face of Jesus, before whose image other loves all flee; and when they crown Him Lord of All; I'll be there. For this is just what Heaven Means to me!

What will twill be when we get over yonder, And join the throng upon the crystal sea!  To meet our loved ones and crown Christ forever. Oh, this is just what Heaven means to me!
