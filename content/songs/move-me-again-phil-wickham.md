Open the gates to Your hidden place
Lord I wanna to go, Lord I wanna go
Reveal Yourself and Your hidden will
Lord I wanna know, Lord I wanna know
What lies beyond my understanding
What holds me back from Your love
Come like the wind, move me again
Catch me off guard, unveil this heart
Fall like the rain, fill me again
My Savior and friend, move me again
Bring back the light that burns deep inside
Lord I need You now, Lord I need You now
Renew my strength, breathe Your life in me
And I will rise again, I will rise again
And I know my heart and flesh have failed You
Don't hold me back from Your love
Come like the wind, move me again
Catch me off guard, unveil this heart
Fall like the rain, fill me again
My Savior and friend, move me again
