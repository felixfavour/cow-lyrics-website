There is a sweet anointing in the sanctuary
There is a stillness in the atmosphere
O come and lay down the burdens you have carried
For in the sanctuary God is here
He is here, He is here
To break the yoke and lift the heavy burden
He is here, He is here
To heal the hopeless heart and bless the broken
O come and lay down the burdens you have carried
For in the sanctuary God is here
Speak Lord, Speak Lord
Speak Lord, Speak Lord
Speak Lord, Speak Lord
Speak Lord, Speak Lord
Speak Lord, Speak Lord
Speak Lord, Speak Lord
Speak Lord, Speak Lord
O come and lay down the burdens you have carried
For in the sanctuary God is here
