[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Some of you are waiting for a special little place to shout
You tryna wait for a little cute moment to shout
Honey, you could shout right now
[Chorus: Choir, 
Kirk Franklin
]
When I think about Jesus
What He's done for me
When I think about Jesus
How He set me free
I could dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance all night (
Say
)
When I think about Jesus
What He's done for me
When I think about Jesus
How He set me free
I could dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance all night
When I think about Jesus
What He's done for me
When I think about Jesus
How He set me free (
Come on, say
)
I could dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance all night
