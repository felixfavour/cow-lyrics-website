You call us out from the depths
Into Your freedom
Our chains are gone
No weapon formed shall prevail
Your word is stronger
We overcome
Your glory resounds through the age
All saint declaring
Your great renown
Your kingdom forever will stand
We won't be shaken
We will not fear
Our God, a mighty Warrior
You're a consuming fire
In victory You reign
We triumph in Your name
Jesus, the great commander
You conquered death forever
In victory You reign
We triumph in Your name
