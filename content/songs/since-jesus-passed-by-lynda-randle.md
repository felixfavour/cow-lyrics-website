Like a blind man I wandered
So lost and undone
A beggar so helpless
Without God or His Son
Then my Savior in mercy
Heard and answered my cry
And oh what a diff'rence
Since Jesus passed by
Since Jesus passed by
Since Jesus passed by
Oh what a diff'rence
Since Jesus passed by
Well I can't explain it
And I cannot tell you why
But oh what a diff'rence
Since Jesus passed by) l
All my yesterdays are buried
In the deepest of the sea
That old load of guilt I carried
It's all gone, praise God I'm free
Looking for that bright tomorrow
Where no tears will dim the eye
Snd oh what a diff'rence
Since Jesus passed by
Since Jesus passed by
Since Jesus passed by
Oh what a diff'rence
Since Jesus passed by
Well I can't explain it
And I cannot tell you why
But oh what a diff'rence
Oh what a diff'rence
Oh what a diff'rence
Since Jesus passed by
