HE AROSE Lyrics by SAMSONG
Humanity Watched Him
Lay in the Tomb
As He Lay Lifeless,
They all have Lost Hope
The Son of God,
He Supposed to Save the World
How can He die,
He that Gave us Life
But he had to die
To bring Eternal Life,
Look at him, Lifeless in the grave
Pre  Chorus]
That's not how the Story Ends
Three days Later,
He Rose from the dead
The grave could not Hold him down
The Stone is Rolled Away

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah,
He Arose, He Arose
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah,
He Arose, He Arose
He was Bruised for our Iniquity
He didn't have to,
But he did it all for me
He Laid down his Life,
So I shall not die
They Hung Him High,
Pierced him by the Side
But every Stripe he took
Counts for my Healing
On the Cross all my Pain he Gladly Bare
[Pre  Chorus]
That's not how the Story Ends
Three days Later,
He Rose from the dead
The grave could not Hold him down
The Stone is Rolled Away

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah,
He Arose, He Arose
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah,
He Arose, He Arose
