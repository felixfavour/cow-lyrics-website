The greatest gift to man from the Father
Would change us all in ways we've never seen
Yet His first moments were in a manger
And soon every living thing would call Him King, yes they would
Though we didn't know it then
We soon would understand
That His life would reveal God's perfect plan
He's not just a man
He is God
And He is not just a baby
He is King
No He is not just a lamb
But the Lion of Judah
Savior and Ruler of all
We've tried our very best perceive Him
Sometimes I think it was beyond our reach
Well I guess that's why He asked us to receive Him
With a child-like heart only believe
And I hear Him ask again
Who do men say that I am
And I feel the need to make the whole world see
He's not just a man no no
He is God
And He is not just a baby
He is King
No He is not just a lamb
But the Lion of Judah
Savior and Ruler of all
He's not just a man oh no oh no
He is God
And He is not just a baby
He is King
No He is not just a lamb
But the Lion of Judah
Savior and Ruler of all
But the Lion of Judah
Savior and Ruler of all.....
(Repeat)
He is not just a man
