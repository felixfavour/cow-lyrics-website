For the city, for the world we pray
Let Your light shine down
Come around and live in us
For the close and the far away
Everywhere You are
Everywhere
And we lift high the banner of the cross
There is no greater love than this, no love but this
Jesus Christ laid down His life for us
There is no greater love than His, no love but His
To the city, to the world we go
Set us free, heal the land
You have promised, God, You can
To the last and the least we go
Everywhere You are
Everywhere
And we lift high the banner of the cross
There is no greater love than this, no love but this
Jesus Christ laid down His life for us
There is no greater love than His, no love but His
