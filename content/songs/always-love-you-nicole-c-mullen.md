Tell me if You break the hourglass
Can You hold to what You have?
Can You make the moment last?
Tell me if You give away Your heart
And the life tears You apart
Is it the end or just the start
Well, no matter how far You go
I will always love You
Like a thousand rivers from my Soul
I will always love You
I miss You and the funny things You say
I remember every day
In a hundred different ways
I miss You being here with me
Thought You've been set free
I hold You in my memory
'Cause no matter how far You go
I will always love You
Like a thousand rivers from my Soul
I will always love You
