From the lofty courts of Heaven came a bud on earth to bloom, knowing when He left His Father, that his fate would be the tomb. But the grave, it could not hold Him, angels rolled the stone away, now the mighty Rose of Sharon is still blooming yet today.

But the next time He comes, He won't have to die for me. The next time He comes, there won't be a calvary; the next time He comes, will begin eternity. And when he comes again, He'll be coming for me. 

I remember when I met Him, how the spirit took control, He established my going, now He stars in my life's role. For a man to come from heaven, knowing then of calvary. Oh, what love beyond all measure that He'd give His life for me. 

But the next time He comes, He won't have to die for me. The next time He comes, there won't be a calvary; the next time He comes, will begin eternity. And when he comes again, He'll be coming for me.
