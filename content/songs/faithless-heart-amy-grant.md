At times the woman deep inside me
Wanders far from home
And in my mind I live a life
That chills me to the bone
A heart, running for arms out of reach
But who is the stranger my longing seeks?
I don't know
But it scares me through and through
'Cause I've a man at home
Who needs me to be true
Oh, faithless heart
Be far away from me
Playing games inside my head
That no one else can see
Oh, faithless heart
You tempt me to the core
But you can't have a hold on me
So don't come around anymore
(The feelings here, God, the feelings here.)
God, you know my feelings here
Could wipe my world away
Ravaging the promises
A stronger heart once made
So hold me, I'm falling so fast
And tell me that the fighting inside will pass
As I walk away
And find the strength to choose
The man who waits for me
With a heart that's true
