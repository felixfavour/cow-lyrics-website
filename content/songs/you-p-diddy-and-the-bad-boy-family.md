You
You (Oh-oh)
You (You)
You (You, you, you, yeah, yeah)
You've always been right there to let me know everything's alright (You)
Whenever darkness came my way, you were my light (You)
And I wanna thank you for the difference in my life (You)
Can't even count the reasons why, oh why (You)
I lift you up and praise your name (Oh yeah)
You gave me strength to see another day (When I was lost)
When I was lost, you helped me find my way (Yes, you did)
When it seems I can't face another day (Oh yeah)
That's when I call on you
In the time of trouble, when faced with struggle
I call nobody but you (I call on you, Lord)
When I'm feeling lonely, no one around me
Still I call on you (Oh)
You always placed your arms around me (Oh-oh)
When I needed you (When I needed, yeah)
That's why I sing this song to tell you
Lord, I do love you
