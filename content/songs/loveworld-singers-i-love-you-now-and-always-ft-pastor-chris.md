It's so amazing
You're the God who made the heavens
Great is Your love for me
You load with mercy in the morning
And goodness at night time
In and out of season
I'm basking in Your grace
So, on my lips Your Praise is on repeat
Like an anthem in my soul, Almighty God
I love You now and always my eternal King
Your liquid love us overwhelming
It's indescribable
You strike the sweetest love chords
On the strings of my heart
Your demonstrated love's my victory
I love You now and always my eternal King
Your liquid love us overwhelming
It's indescribable
You strike the sweetest love chords
On the strings of my heart
Your demonstrated love's my victory
It's so amazing
That the voice that formed creation
Is the same that calls my name at every dawn.
You lit up my life with the beauty of Your glory
For You alone, my Lord, I live
So, on my lips Your Praise is on repeat
Like an anthem in my soul, Almighty God
I love You now and always my eternal King
Your liquid love us overwhelming
It's indescribable
You strike the sweetest love chords
On the strings of my heart
Your demonstrated love's my victory
The thorns of my pain
You wore in a crown
You died and rose that I might live again
And all of my days
I'll be telling Your story
There's nothing else I live for but You, only You
I love You now and always my eternal King
Your liquid love us overwhelming
It's indescribable
You strike the sweetest love chords
On the strings of my heart
Your demonstrated love's my victory
