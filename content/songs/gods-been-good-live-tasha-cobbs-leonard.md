Up early in the morning
When I hear the birds singing
It sounds like freedom
You been good to me
Even late in the evening
When the day is ending
I’ll still be singing
You been good to me
Oh oh oh glory hallelujah
I came running when He set me free
God’s been good to me
Oh oh oh glory hallelujah
I was blind but now my eyes can see
God’s been good to me
Got a testimony
Your redemption story
Go run and tell it
You’ve been good to me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
God’s been good to me
Ain’t no chains gonna shackle me
I’m free, I’m free indeed
Ain’t no rock crying out for me
I’m free, I’m free indeed
Ain’t no storm gonna steal my peace
I’m free, I’m free indeed
Whom the sun sеts free is free indeed
I’m free, I’m free indeed
