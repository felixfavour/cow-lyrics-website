I'm not just a conqueror
No not just a conqueror
I'm not just a conqueror
But I'm more than a conqueror
I'm not just a conqueror
No not just a conqueror
I'm not just a conqueror
But I'm more than a conqueror
The fight is fixed
I know, I'll win
I won't give in
Cause I'm more than a conqueror
My walk is strong
My faith is long
I can't, can't go wrong
Cause I'm more than a conqueror
I am not a conqueror
Don't call me a conqueror
I am not a conqueror
Cause I'm more than a conqueror
I'm not just a conqueror
No not just a conqueror
I'm not just a conqueror
But I'm more than a conqueror
