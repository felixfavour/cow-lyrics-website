(TRAVIS GREENE)
What my eyes can't see I still believe
Everything spoken to me
There's no word that can come back void
I will trust the report of the Lord
God is not a man that He should lie
Every need He will supply
So I will wait, I will not be moved
I believe, I believe, I will trust in You
While I'm waiting I'm getting stronger
My faith is rising, and I will run on
While I'm waiting, I'm lifting up on wings as eagles
I believe, I will trust in You
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh
I believe, I will trust in You
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh
I believe, I will trust in You
(What my eyеs can't see)
What my eyes can't see
(I still beliеve)
I still believe
(Everything)
Everything spoken to me
(There's no word)
There's no word that can come back void
(I will trust)
I will trust the report of the Lord
(That's why)
God is not a man that He should lie
Every need
(He will)
He will supply
(I will wait)
I will wait
(I will not be moved)
I will not be moved
(Hey)
I believe, I believe, I will trust in You
(While I wait)
While I'm waiting I'm getting stronger
My faith is rising, yeah, and I will run on (hey)
While I'm waiting I'm lifting up on wings as eagles
I believe (hey) I will trust in You
Everybody sings
Oh oh oh, you got it, (oh oh oh)
Everybody
Oh oh oh
I believe, I will trust in You
Oh oh oh (oh oh oh)
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh
I believe, I will trust in You
