They might say I'ma sinner
If I don't sing hallelujah
That I'll be forgotten if every song I sing's not to Ya
But I find peace in holy ground
In a little farm house in a no-name town
Where we say our prayers each night
Maybe I'm a dreamer
I still get high on hoping
I might close my eyes sometimes
But I keep my hands wide open
I question every word I choose
But the answers all come back to You
I'm just tryin' to get it right
If I got asked to preach on Sunday
What would my sermon be?
But You're not hard of hearing
And You're tired of I'm sorry
Forgive me for the countless ways
I've tried to climb to grace
I'm singin' it all different now
But the promise is the same
After all, I'm human
Just skin and bones and pain
Still praying for a melody
To play out on these six strings
I wonder if I'm good enough
And if I'll ever measure up
But I'm tryin' to get it right
If I got asked to preach on Sunday
What would my sermon be?
'Cause You're not hard of hearing
And You're tired of I'm sorry
Forgive me for the countless ways
I've tried to climb to grace
I'm singin' it all different now
But the promise is the same
Yeah, the promise is the same
And it's right there in my children's eyes
The truth my wandering tried like hell to hide
If I got asked to preach on Sunday
What would my sermon be?
'Cause You're not hard of hearing
And You're tired of I'm sorry
Grace, so forgive me for the countless ways
I've tried to climb to grace
I'm singin' it all different now
I pray they understand, somehow
That the promise is the same
Yeah, the promise is the same
Yeah, the promise is the same
