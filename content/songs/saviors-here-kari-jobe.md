You bring hope
You bring life
Awaken hearts open eyes
With our voices hidden eyes
We call these dry bones to come alive
You are faithful you are truth
We can always run to
Love that never fails
Arms that never close
Blood with cover sin
Grace that never ends
You have saved us
You have won
City's broken
Death is gone
Freedom is found
Breakthrough is near
In your presence
No more fear
Our savior's here
Our savior's here
Faith is stirring
Hearts are free
Chains are broken and we believe
You are mighty you come through
We can always run to
