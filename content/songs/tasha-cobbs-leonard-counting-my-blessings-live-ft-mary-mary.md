I'm counting my blessings
Telling you what God has done
Counting my blessings
Naming them one by one
If you need a witness
I will be the one
I'm counting my blessings
I'm telling you what God has done
I remember when the pain was so deep
Thought it would kill me
My strength was so weak
When I looked around
All I could see, was Your hand on me
And that is just one of the ways
I'm counting my blessings
Telling you what God has done
I'm counting my blessings
Naming them one by one
And if you need a witness
I will be the one
I'm counting my blessings
Telling you what God has done
Just remember when the bills were due
Your friends were few
He always came through
Even when your heart was broken
Your faith was stolen
But now you can get up and say
I'm counting my blessings
Telling you what God has done
I'm counting my blessings
Naming them one by one
And if you need a witness
I will be the one
I'm counting my blessings
Telling you what God has done
I'm counting my blessings
Telling you what God has done
I'm counting my blessings
Naming them one by one
And if you need a witness
I will be the one
I'm counting my blessings
Telling you what God has done
Telling you what God has done
Telling you what God has done
Telling you what God has done
Telling you what God has done
Telling you what God has done
Telling you what God has done
Telling you what God has done
Telling you what God has done
Wish I had the time to tell it all
How He answered me before I even called
I got angels watching over all-night long
And a promise that He'll never let me fall
Over and over
Over and over
Keep on blessing me
Over and over
Over and over
Keep on blessing me
Over and over
Over and over
Keep on blessing me
Over and over
Over and over
Keep on blessing me
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Keep on blessing
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Keep on blessing me
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Keep on blessing me
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Keep on blessing
Count, count your blessings
Count, count your blessings
Count, count your blessings
Count, count your blessings
Count, count your blessings
Count, count your blessings
Count, count your blessings
Count, count your blessings
Count, count your blessings
Count, count your blessings
Count, count your blessings
Count, count your blessings
And if you need a witness
I will be the one
Counting my blessings
I'm telling you what God has done
And if you need a witness
I will be the one
I'm counting my blessings
Telling you what God has done
And if you need a witness
I will be the one...
