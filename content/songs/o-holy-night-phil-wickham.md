O holy night! The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error, pining
'Til He appeared, and the soul felt its worth
[Pre-Chorus]
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees!
Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine!
O night when Christ was born!
O night divine!
O night, O night divine!
Truly, He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break
For the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His Holy Name
