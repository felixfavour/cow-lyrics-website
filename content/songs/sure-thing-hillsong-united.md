[Intro]
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus Christ, my righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand
Lead me to the Rock
'Cause I need something higher
Higher than the world could understand
Foolish as the Cross
Humble as the price You paid
The wisdom of a Kingdom made to last
'Cause I don't wanna build this life
On Babylons of bricks and pride
Sitting on a fault line bound to quake
I'd rather be a bedrock fool
Who trusts in nothing less than You
When every other sure thing surely fails
Lead me to the Rock
Lift me from this sinking sand
I'm sorry for the junk I took for grace
Don't let it take a fall
To bring me to my knees again
But if it's what I need
I'll take my place
