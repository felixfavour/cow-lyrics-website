My very plan is to trust in You
I trust in You
All my hope is found in You
I've found in You
There is no fear
There is no doubt
The One who walked on water
Holds my hands
You who began this good work in me
You are able
You perfect it all
You perfect it all
You make all things new
Like only You can
You perfect it all
You perfect it all
All I have to do is fix my eyes on You
You, You, You, You, You, You
I fix my eyes on You
I fix my eyes on You
My very plan is to trust in You
I trust in You
All my hope is found in You
I've found in You
There is no fear
There is no doubt
The One who walked on water
Holds my hands
You who began this good work in me
You are able
You perfect it all
You perfect it all
You make all things new
Like only You can
You perfect it all
You perfect it all
All I have to do, is fix my eyes on You
You, You, You, You, You, You, oh-oh
Lord I fix my eyes on You
Fix my eyes on You
You, You, You, You, You, You
I fix my eyes on You
For the One who walks with the Lord
Never walk alone
And those who call upon the name of Jesus
Never cry for help
For the One who walks with the Lord
Never walk alone
And those who call upon the name of Jesus
Never cry for help
You perfect it all
You perfect it all
You make all things new
Like only You can
I have no fear (I have no fear)
And I have no doubt, You are able
You perfect it all
You perfect it all
You make all things new
Like only You can
You perfect it all
You perfect it all
All I have to do, is to fix my eyes on You
You, You, You (fix my eyes on You)
I can walk on water (fix my eyes on You)
As I fix my eyes on You
I keep my eyes on You
All things are possible to me
As I fix my eyes on You (fix my eyes on You)
Only You, sweet Jesus
Fix my eyes (I fix my eyes)
I fix my eyes on You
I will never fail (no)
As I fix eyes on You
