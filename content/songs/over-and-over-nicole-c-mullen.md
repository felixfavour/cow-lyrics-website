Ooh-whoa, yeah
You take my night times
And turn them into bright skies above me
When rain falls down, down
You stay with me and wash all my cares away
In seasons of heartache
I turn my troubles over to You
And then You show me that I could win
And then You show me that I could choose
Oh, my choice is to love You forever
'Cause You've shown me
Over and over
Keep on lovin' me
Keep on tellin' me
Over and over
That You'll never leave my side
Over and over
You keep on lovin' me
Keep on tellin' me, over
Ooh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm not a loser
But pain's a game I never did wanna play
And then You showed me that I could win
And then You show me that I could choose
Oh, my choice is to love You forever
'Cause You've shown me
