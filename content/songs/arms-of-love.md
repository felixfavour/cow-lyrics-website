I sing a simple song of love
To my Savior to my Jesus
I’m grateful for the things You’ve done
My loving Savior oh precious Jesus

My heart is glad that You’ve called me Your own
There’s no place I’d rather be

Than in Your arms of love
In Your arms of love
Holding me still
Holding me near
In Your arms of love
