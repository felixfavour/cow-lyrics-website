[Chorus]
You are my life, You are my love
You are my reason
You are my hope, You are my joy
You are my passion
My all in all, Jesus, my all in all
My all in all, Jesus, my all in all
In the desert, You're the river
An ever flowing stream of life
In the battle, You're the victor
And we'll raise Your banner high
In the darkness, You're the fire
A holy flame for all to see
And in my heart You reign forever
[Pre-Chorus]
My all, my everything
You are my life, You are my love
You are my reason
You are my hope, You are my joy
You are my passion
My all in all, Jesus, my all in all
My all in all, Jesus, my all in all
