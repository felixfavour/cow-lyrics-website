Much faster than the blink of an eye
Lightning will flash and He'll split the sky
Nobody knows the day or the time
The trumpet will sound and we will arise
When heaven calls
And this life is over
We'll stand before our God and Savior
When heaven calls we must be ready
To trade these mortal things
For immortality
When heaven calls
For every man there is a time
To love and to laugh, to live and to die
So I'm living for the One who is Love
And I'm dying to hear Him say well done
When heaven calls
And this life is over
I'll stand before my God and Savior
When heaven calls I will be ready
To trade these mortal things
For immortality
When heaven calls
