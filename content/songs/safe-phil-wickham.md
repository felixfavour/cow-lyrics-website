To the one whose dreams are falling all apart
And all you're left with is a tired and broken heart
I can tell by your eyes you think you're on your own
But you're not alone
Have you heard of the One who can calm the raging sea
Gives sight to the blind, pull the lame up to their feet?
[Pre-Chorus: Phil Wickham]
With a love so strong it never let you go
No, you're not alone
[Chorus: Phil Wickham]
You will be safe in His arms
You will be safe in His arms
'Cause the hands that hold the world
Are holding your heart
This is the promise He made
He will be with you always
When everything is falling apart
You will be safe in His arms
Did you know that the voice that brings the dead to life
Is the very same voice that calls you now to rise?
