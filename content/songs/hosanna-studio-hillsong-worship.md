I see the King of Glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes, the whole earth shakes
I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing, the people sing
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith, with selfless faith, oh
I see a near revival
Oh, it is stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees, we're on our knees
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in th–µ highest
