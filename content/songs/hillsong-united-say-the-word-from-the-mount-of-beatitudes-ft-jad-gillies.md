Say the word and there is light.  Say the word and dead bones rise. Every start and end hangs on your voice ; for your word ne'er returns void.
Written in a million skies, speaking to this heart of mine. All that I am with all creation, hanging on every word that you've spoken; could not be shaken. Clinging for life to all your promise, hanging on every word that you say, eiee..., eiee...  it will remain. And my soul will hang on every word you say.  Word made flesh you wrote in grace. Promise kept through cross and grave. Over words of stone you spelt out love! And when you say, it is done, it is done!
   Written in a billion skies, speaking to this heart of mine. All that I am with all creation, hanging on every word that you've spoken, it will not be shaken! Clinging for life to all your promise, ganging on  every word that you've written in a million skies, speaking to this heart of mine. All that I am with all creation, hanging on every word that you've spoken; it'll not be shaken! Clinging for life to all your promise, hanging on every word that you say, eieee... eieee.. it will remain! And my soul will hang on every word you say. It's an olden word that never ever fails And my soul will hang on every word you say!
