Like many waterfalls I cry
Like something deep inside has died
Oh, the hurt, the guilt, the pain
To know I broke Your heart again
And like a hurricane that blows
A thunderstorm inside my soul
So can you speak unto the wind
And renew my life again?
Forgive me, I have sinned
I am guilty of the nails that pierced Your hands
Oh, I'm cryin' out, purify
Rid me of this guiltiness I feel inside
I'm beggin' please forgive me
I can't describe what's in my soul
I feel ashamed to let You know
Oh, the burden, oh, the weight
That I've carried from that day
But You were there, You saw it all
Every detail great and small
And yet You love me just the same
And You remind me that You came, Lord, You came to
