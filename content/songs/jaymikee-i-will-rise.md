I will rise
From beneath the dust
I will shake all the pain and the sorrows from my past
I will see a brand new day
As I receive a second chance from the God above
Lift me up and let me stand
From the valleys below
Unto the highest plane
Give me wings so I can soar
Over all the land and seas and the mountains
This is my prayer
This is my prayer, oh Lord
This is my prayer
I will rise
(Ah)
From beneath the dust
(Ah)
I will shake all the pain and the sorrows from my past
(Ah)
I will see a brand new day
(Ah)
As I receive a second chance from the God above
(Ah)
Lift me up and let me stand
(Ah)
From the valleys below
(Ah)
Unto the highest plane
(Ah)
Give me wings so I can soar
(Ah)
Over all the land and seas and the mountains
(Ah)
This is my prayer...
