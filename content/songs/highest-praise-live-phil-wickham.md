I lift my voice to sing of Your goodness
I lift my voice to sing of Your Love
I lift my voice to sing hallelujah
Jesus our Savior
You're worthy of it all
I lift my voice to sing of Your goodness
I lift my voice to sing of Your Love
I lift my voice to sing hallelujah
Jesus our Savior
You're worthy of it all
We give You the highest praise
We give You the highest praise
We give You the highest praise
Jesus our Savior
You're worthy of it all
I lift my hands because I'm forgiven
I lift my hands because I'm set free
I lift my hands a sign of surrender
Jesus our Savior
You're worthy of it all
