It Is Coming From My Heart
Praise And Thanks Unto You, Lord
All The Things That You Have Done
I'm Grateful For Your Love
I Give You The Praise


I'm Counting My Blessings
I Just Can't Keep It To Myself
When I Thought That He Had Done Too Much
Jesus Did It Again

I Can't Tell It Enough,
I Shout It Loud From The Mountain Top


Give Him The Praise

I Dance And Praise The Lord

I Clap And Praise The Lord

I Shout And Praise The Lord

And When I Thought That He Had Done Too Much
Jesus Did It Again

Rejoice And Praise The Lord
