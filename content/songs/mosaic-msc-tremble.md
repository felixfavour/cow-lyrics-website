"Tremble"
Peace, bring it all to peace
The storms surrounding me
Let it break
At Your name
Still, call the sea to still
The rage in me to still
Every wave
At Your name
Jesus, Jesus
You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus
You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
Breathe, call these bones to live
Call these lungs to sing once again
I will praise

Jesus, Jesus
You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus
You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus
You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
Your name is a light that the shadows can't deny
Your name cannot be overcome
Your name is alive forever lifted high
Your name cannot be overcome

Jesus, Jesus
You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus
You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus
Your name is a light that the shadows can't deny
Your name cannot be overcome
Your name is alive, forever lifted high
Your name cannot be overcome
Your name is a light that the shadows can't deny
Your name cannot be overcome
Your name is alive, forever lifted high
Your name cannot be overcome
Jesus, Jesus
You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus
You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
