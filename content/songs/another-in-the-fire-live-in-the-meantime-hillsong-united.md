There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
There was another in the fire, standing next to me
There was another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, what powеr set free
There is a cross that bеars the burden, where another died for me
There is another in the fire
All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won't bow to the things of this world
And I know
And I know I will never be alone
There is another in the fire, standing next to me
There is another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, what power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body, and now that power lives in me
