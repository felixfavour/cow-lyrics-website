Your perfect love is casting out fear in me
I'm in a hollow, the hollow of your hands
No guilt in life, no fear in death
Is the power of Christ in me
No guilt in life, no fear in death
Is the power of Christ in me
I'm standing on the solid rock
His name is Jesus
I'm standing on the solid rock
His name is Jesus
He did not fail, I cannot fail
His name is Jesus
I'm standing on the solid rock
His name is Jesus
Oh, by my God
I run through a troop
Oh, by my God
I live by your power
No shaking, no drying
I stand unmoved
I stand unshakable
I'm not tired
I'm caught in the solid rock
No shaking (no shaking), no drive (no drive)
I stand unmoved
Secured in the Father's hands
I am rooted in the solid rock
I'm standing on the solid rock (I'm standing on the solid rock)
His name is Jesus (his name is Jesus)
I'm standing on the solid rock
His name is Jesus
He did not fail, I cannot fail
His name is Jesus
I'm standing on the solid rock
His name is Jesus
I'm standing on the solid rock
His name is Jesus
I'm standing on the solid rock
His name is Jesus
He did not fail, I cannot fail
His name is Jesus
I'm standing on the solid rock
His name is Jesus
Call the name Jesus
Call the name Jesus
Call the name of Jesus
The one who breaks forth the way (Jesus)
Is gone ahead of me (Jesus)
I know how the story ends (Jesus)
'Cause I know who wrote my story (Jesus)
Yes, I know who wrote this chapter (Jesus)
The one who breaks forth the way (Jesus)
Mediator (Jesus)
Victorious one (Jesus)
Victorious one (Jesus)
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
Lift up your head oh ye gates (Jesus)
Lift up your head oh ye gates (Jesus)
And be lifted up everlasting doors (Jesus)
Be lifted up everlasting doors
King of glory is here
King of glory is here
King of glory is here
The king of glory is here
I'm standing on the solid rock
I'm standing on the solid rock (I'm standing on the solid rock)
His name is Jesus
I'm standing on the solid rock (I'm standing on the rock)
His name is Jesus
He did not fail, I cannot fail
His name is Jesus
He did not fail, I cannot fail
His name is Jesus
His name is Yeshua
His name is Jesus
