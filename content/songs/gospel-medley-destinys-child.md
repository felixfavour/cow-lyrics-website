[Chorus]
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
You've been so good to me
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I'm grateful for my blessings
I'm grateful for my struggles, trials and tribulations I've been through
I've realized no one can love like You do
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I feel your presence near
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I won't hold back my tears
I gave you my trust and you took me out of the dark rain
My Lord, I survived it, I give You the praise
[Bridge]
Lord, You've been so good
You've been so good to me
I'm so grateful for my blessings
Giving You all the praise
Lord, You've been so good
You've been so good to me
I'm grateful for all of my blessings
Giving You all the praise
