Arise... awaken from your sleep
The earth... calls in out in desperate need
Arise, arise, arise... your light has come
(And the glory of the Lord is upon you)
You were created for this time
So arise, the spirit says arise
Arise... this is your destiny
Endow... Christ's authority
Decree, declare and speak in Jesus' name
(And every principality)
Was bowed down
You were created for this time
So arise, the spirit says arise
(Spoken:)
The Church we see is not the periphery of the world
But the world on the periphery of the church
Meaning that when God looks at the earth
When He looks at a city
He does not see a city with a church in it;
He sees the church with a city around it
The Church is the vehicle by which Jesus
Speaks, asks and moves;
Everything God wants to do in the earth
He wants to do through His Church
Now that you hear his calling and awakening
What will be your response?
