Omo e get days I don't feel myself
E get days I embrace my shell
So many days that I doubt your word
Too many times I don't feel enough
Omo e get days wen I dey lose guard
E get days when it gets real bad
And I begin to drown inside my fears and doubts a scary turn now
Oh Lord make you help your boy
Make them no come steal my joy
Remind me when I'm weak, you're strong
Remind me of your precious love
Oh Lord make you help your boy
Make them no come steal my joy
Remind me when I'm weka, you're strong
Remind me of your precious love
Now tell me am I still worthy(for your work)
Shebi e be you call me(for your work)
Shebi e be you send me(for your work)
Emotion e no want let me(for your work)
Tell em am I still worthy(for your work)
Shebi e be you call me(for your work)
Shebi e be you send me(for your work)
Emotion e no want let me go(for your work)
Moti dele 2x
Speak to me tonight now
Oh tonight now
Moti dele 2x
Speak to me tonight now 2x
I've been feeling pain again
All the thoughts in my head
Are getting to me 2x
Feels like I'm far away
And I'm walking with this chains
All around me 2x
Bit aii aii aii
I'm free when I'm walking with you
There's no one else than can come close to
Doing the things that you can do
Aii aii aii aiii
I know that you're there when I call you
There's thing that can surpass you
Everlasting love it don't ever end
Moti dele 2x
Speak to me tonight now 2x
Moti dele 2x
Speak to me tonight now 2x

Shebi e be you call me(for your work)
Shebi e be you send me(for your work)
Emotion e no want let me(for your work)
Tell me am I still worthy (for your work)
No be you call me(for your work)
Shebi e be you send me(for your work)
Emotion e no wan let me go(for your work)
