And how faintly I remember Your love song over me
But the further that I wonder, the noise is deafening
Now the only thing I feel is, how far You are away
But this distance now between us, is driving me insane

Father I miss You
My heart is ready now
To follow the sound
The sound of Your voice
That echoes inside
Father I'm desperate
I lost my way somehow
I follow the truth
The truth of Your love
Back into the light
Lead me back home
Lead me back home
And I traded trust for pleasure
And diamonds for fool's gold
I made the world my treasure, but under price my soul
And a whisper through the numbness, a melody of hope
That love song I remember, is leading me back home

Father I miss You
My heart is ready now
To follow the sound
The sound of Your voice
That echoes inside
Father I'm desperate
I lost my way somehow
I follow the truth
The truth of Your love
Back into the light
Lead me back home
(Lead me back home)
[Bridge]
But I never reached the gate before You come running to me
All the words I rehearsed for days, just fall at Your feet
Lord I never reached the gate before You come running to me
All the years I threw away one embrace our redeem

Father I missed You
My heart is overwhelmed
Here in Your arms is where I belong
Forever at home
Father I love You
Nothing can take Your place
You were the First and You'll be the last, Lover of my soul
Lead me back home
Lead me back home
Lead me back home
Lead me back home
Lead me back home (Lord I love You)
Lead me back home
Lead me back home, with You
