The days are cold
Here amidst the drifts of snow
Just a metaphor of us
So many Christmases ago
We had a love so deep
Just like the joy the season brings
So let's fall in love again this Christmas night
Ah, ah-ah
[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Khalid]
And every Christmas, I'll be there
This time of year, we're both aware
We gotta fall in love again at Christmastime
And all the angels in the sky
Shine down on us as we roll by
We gotta fall in love again at Christmastime
In the candle's glow
I'm awake, but no one knows
Just waiting patiently to hear thе sleigh bells jingle, thеre they go
And while the Northern Star lights the way, I dream of us
So let's fall in love again this Christmas night
[Chorus: Mariah Carey & Khalid]
And every Christmas, I'll be there
This time of year, we're both aware
We gotta fall in love again at Christmastime
And all the angels in the sky
Shine down on us as we roll by
We gotta fall in love again at Christmastime
