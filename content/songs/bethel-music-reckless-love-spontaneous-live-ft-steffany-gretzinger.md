(Instrumentals)
Before I spoke a word, you are singing over me
You have been so so good to me
Before I took a breath, you breathe your life to me
You have been so so kind to me
Chorus
Oh the overwhelming, never ending reckless love God
Oh it chases me down, right till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
And I couldn't earn it
And I don't deserve it
Still you give yourself away
Oh the overwhelming, never ending reckless love God
(Instrumentals)
When I was your fool, still your love fought for me
You have been so so good to me
When I felt no worth, you paid it all for me
You have so so kind to me
Chorus
Oh the overwhelming, never ending reckless love God
Oh it chases me down, right till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
And I couldn't earn it
And I don't deserve it
Still you give yourself away
Oh the overwhelming, never ending reckless love God
(Instrumentals)
There's no shadow you won't light out
Mountain you won't climb at
Coming after me
There's no wall you won't kick down
Lie you won't tear down
Coming after me (4x)
Chorus
Oh the overwhelming, never ending reckless love God
Oh it chases me down, right till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
And I couldn't earn it
And I don't deserve it
Still you give yourself away
Oh the overwhelming, never ending reckless love God
(Instrumentals)
There's no shadow you won't light out
Mountain you won't climb at
Coming after me
There's no wall you won't kick down
Lie you won't tear down
Coming after me (6x)
Chorus
Oh the overwhelming, never ending reckless love God
Oh it chases me down, right till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
And I couldn't earn it
And I don't deserve it
Still you give yourself away
Oh the overwhelming, never ending reckless love God (2x)
Your banner over us is love
Let the enemy read it
Let the enemy see it
Your banner over us is love
Oh we're here to feast
Let him watch us eat
Your banner over us is love
While your people feast
Let the enemy watch us eat
Your banner over us is love
