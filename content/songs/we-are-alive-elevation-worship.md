You came to change the world
You came, it was the only way for us to be restored
You came to make us new
You came to warm our dying hearts and bring us back to You
Pre-Chorus:
And when You came, You broke our chains
And You lifted us out of our graves
Chorus 1:
We are alive because You died
You buried our shame, when you rose from the grave
You became man, and You conquered our sin
So we'll live this life to celebrate, celebrate Your name
Verse: You came to save the world
You came because You loved enough to fix what we destroyed
You came into our hearts
We were falling down until You came and rescued us
Pre-Chorus:
Chorus 2:
We are alive because You died
You buried our shame, when you rose from the grave
You became man, and You conquered our sin
So we'll live this life to celebrate, celebrate Your name
