I can take a plane high up in the sky
And fly for a million miles
Write a melody so sweet
Make a tear turn into a smile
I can see the color of spring
I can even feel the weather change
And soon the leaves fall and winter calls
'cause nothing ever stays the same
When I think of where I've been
What I've done and all I own
How I think I know everything
Like I made it here on my own
And like the wind that blows
Like a flower that grows
Still with all I can do
Without You life's a song with no end
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend
Without You, we're just actors on a stage
Like a child who's lost his way
Wouldn't be here today without You
I admit that sometimes
Pride tries to hide my view
And even this gift that you gave me
I forget it's for You
And all the many days and many ways
Your grace I've abused
Still you were patient
And Your love loved me through
But the wind still blows and the flower still grows
And one thing is still true
