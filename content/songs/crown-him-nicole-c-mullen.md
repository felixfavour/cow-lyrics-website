All hail the powers of Jesus' Name
Let angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him Lord of all
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown Him Lord of all
Ye chosen seed of Israel's race
Ye ransomed from the fall
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace
And crown Him Lord of all
Crown Him, Crown Him, Crown Him Lord of all
Crown Him, Crown Him, Crown Him Lord of all
Let every kindred, every tribe
On this terrestrial ball
To Him all majesty ascribe
And crown Him Lord of all
To Him all majesty ascribe
And crown Him Lord
Crown Him Lord, Crown Him Lord of all
