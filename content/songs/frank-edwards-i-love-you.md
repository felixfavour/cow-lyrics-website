ti:2 I love you]
I think about the price he paid
And the gift of life he gave
Think about the moon and sun
And the air we breathe
You spoke my name to be
I think you and i
And the loves he's shown to us
Think about the blood he shed
That alone just melts my heart
You are a father like none
Maybe I should sing
Yet another song
Just to let you know
What you mean to me
I love you baba ah (2x)
I belong to you
You belong to me
Baba
(Instrumentals)
I think about the humming birds
And the trees that wave their heads
I think about everything in the world
You spoke their name to be
Yes you spoke
Their name to be
I think about my life today
And the way you raised me up
I think about the bread of life
Only you can do it all
You are a father like none
Maybe I should sing
Yet another song
Just to let you know
What you mean to me
I love you baba ah (2x)
I belong to you
You belong to me
Baba
