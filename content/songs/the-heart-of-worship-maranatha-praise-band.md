When the music fades
And all has slipped away
And I simply come
Longing just to be
Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself
Is not what You have required
You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
Your looking into my heart
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And its all about You, its all about You, Jesus
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it
When its all about You, its all about You, Jesus
King of endless worth
No one could express
How much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is Yours
Every single breath!
