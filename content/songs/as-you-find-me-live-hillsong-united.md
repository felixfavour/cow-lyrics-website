I've been strong
And I’ve been broken within a moment
I've been faithful
And I've been reckless at every bend
I’ve held everything together
And watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled
In the same breath
I have wrestled
And I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift
And drifted home again
Plundered blessing
Till I've been desperate to find redemption
And every time I turn around
Lord You're still there
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was found
Before I was lost
I was Yours
Before I was not
Grace to spare
For all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me
