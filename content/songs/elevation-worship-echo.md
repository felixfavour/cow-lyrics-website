When night has fallen
When fear is common
Still You're calling me
When faith is lost
And my hope exhausted
You will be my strength
When my mind says I'm not good enough
God, You're enough for me
I've decided I'm not giving up
You won't give up on me
You won't give up on me
Your love is holding on
And it won't let go
I feel it breaking out like an echo
Your love is holding on
And it won't let go
I feel it breaking out like an echo
Echo in my so-o-o-o-oul
So-o-o-o-oul
In every season
You keep repeating promises to me
Now there's no stopping
What you have started
Till it is complete
When my mind says I'm not good enough
God, You're enough for me
I've decided I'm not giving up
You won't give up on me
You won't give up on me
Your love is holding on
And it won't let go
I feel it breaking out like an echo
Your love is holding on
And it won't let go
I feel it breaking out like an echo
Echo in my so-o-o-o-oul
So-o-o-o-oul
In my so-o-o-o-oul
So-o-o-o-oul
When my mind says I'm not good enough
God, You're enough for me
I've decided I'm not giving up
You won't give up on me
You won't give up on me
Your love is holding on
And it won't let go
I feel it breaking out like an echo
Your love is holding on
And it won't let go
I feel it breaking out, breaking out
Your love is holding on
And it won't let go
I feel it breaking out like an echo
Your love is holding on
And it won't let go
I feel it breaking out, breaking out
Echo in my so-o-o-o-oul
So-o-o-o-oul
In my so-o-o-o-oul
So-o-o-o-ouloul
