Any crown I've ever worn
I lay it down
Any praise I've ever gained
I give it all to You
For there's nothing in this world
That can compare
For You alone are worthy
You alone are worthy
You are near to all who call
Upon Your name
Ever givin', ever loving
You remain the same
For You open up Your hand
And satisfy
I give You all the glory
Give You all the glory
You are worthy, oh Lord, of all honour
You are worthy to receive all praise
In Your presence I live and with all I have to give
I will worship You
You are near to all who call
Upon Your name
Ever giving, ever loving
You remain the same
