And how faintly I remember Your love song over me
But the further that I've wandered, the noise is deafening
Now the only thing I feel is, how far You are away
But this distance now between us, is driving me insane
Father I miss You
My heart is ready now
To follow the sound
The sound of Your voice
That echoes inside
Father I'm desperate
I lost my way somehow
I follow the truth
The truth of Your love
Back into the light
Lead me back home
Lead me back home
And I traded trust for pleasure
And diamonds for fool's gold
I made the world my treasure, but underpriced my soul
Then a whisper through the numbness, a melody of hope
That love song I remember, is leading me back home
