My mind
Marvels at the extravagance of Your love
Your only begotten You gave as a sacrifice
To make me one with You

 And I am dazzled by the luminescence of Your grace
 You called me out of darkness into Your astounding light
For Your glory and Your praise

You delightfully reside in
The castle of my heart
Working inside me
To will and to do of Your good pleasure
You are my all in all


Father of glory
My life You’ve made so beautiful
Beyond all I could ask or think
Great King of glory
I’m overjoyed with thanksgiving
For Your lavish grace in me

Father of glory
My life You’ve made so beautiful
Beyond all I could ask or think
Great King of glory
I’m overjoyed with thanksgiving
For the gift of Your righteousness

My life is found in You
And centered in Your perfect will
 This is the glory revealed in union with You
Lord, I am complete

Your word is the mirror and
The very essence of my being
Lord, as I gaze at Your word, I’m transformed into
The image of Your grand design


You delightfully reside in
the castle of my heart
Working inside me
To will and to do of Your good pleasure
You are my all in all

Father of glory
My life You’ve made so beautiful
Beyond all I could ask or think
Great King of glory
I’m overjoyed with thanksgiving
For Your lavish grace in me

Father of glory
My life You’ve made so beautiful
Beyond all I could ask or think
Great King of glory
I’m overjoyed with thanksgiving
For the gift of Your righteousness
