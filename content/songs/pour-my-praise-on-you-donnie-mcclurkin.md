[Chorus]
I just wanna pour, I just wanna pour my praise on You
I just wanna pour, I just wanna pour my praise on You
I just wanna pour, I just wanna pour my praise on You
I just wanna pour, I just wanna pour my praise on You
'Cause You've been better to me
Than I could ever, ever, ever repay
All that I want, I wanna do
I just wanna pour my praise on-
I just wanna pour, I just wanna pour my praise on You
I just wanna pour, I just wanna pour my praise on You
You've been better to me
Than I could ever, ever, ever repay
All that I want, I wanna do
I just wanna pour my praise on You
You've been better to me
Than I could ever, ever, ever repay
All that I want, I wanna do
I just wanna pour my praise on You
I just wanna pour, I just wanna pour my praise on You
I just wanna pour, I just wanna pour my praise on You
I just wanna pour, I just wanna pour my praise on You
I just wanna pour, I just wanna pour my praise on You
You've been better to me
Than I could ever, ever, ever repay
All that I want, I wanna do
I just wanna pour my praise on You
