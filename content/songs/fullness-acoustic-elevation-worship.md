Fullness of eternal promise
Stirring in Your sons and daughters
Earth revealing heaven's wonders
Spirit come, Spirit come
What You spoke is now unfolding
All Your children shall be holy
Dreams awaken in this moment
Spirit come, Spirit come
Pour it out ... let Your love run over
Here and now ... let Your glory fill this house
Pour it out ... let Your love run over
Here and now ... let Your glory fill this house
Now the world awaits Your presence
And this power is within us
We will rise to be Your image
Spirit come, Spirit come
Pour it out ... let Your love run over
Here and now ... let Your glory fill this house
Pour it out ... let Your love run over
Here and now ... let Your glory fill this house
