Oh girl, oh girl, I hear what you say
I may not understand or relate
My friend, I'm always riding with you
I'll hold your hands, I'm right beside you
Every day, I'm praying for you
I see the pain my friend you go through
And every single tear that you cry
Can I be the friend that you always run to
Can you be the friend that I always run to
Can you be the friend that somebody runs to
Everybody get wetin dem dey go through
Can I be the friend that you always run to
Can you be the friend that I always run to
Can you be the friend that somebody runs to
Everybody get wetin dem dey go through
I guess we all need someone, someone
A little spark in the dark now, in the dark now
I guess we all need someone, someone
Who would hold us down when it falls off
Hold somebody (hold somebody)
Hold somebody (hold somebody)
Hold somebody now (hold somebody)
Hold somebody
And tell them you love them (hold somebody)
Somebody (hold somebody)
Hold somebody (hold somebody)
Hold somebody (oh yeah)
Hold somebody
And tell them you love them
She come begin tell me say
I was really down in pains
Then you come dey tell me say
I am with you all the way
I mean, I was in a bad place
When your words came
And then light came and then
I ain't never really felt so relieved
I'm no longer feeling down
Can I be the friend that you always run to
Can you be the friend that I always run to
Can you be the friend that somebody runs to
Everybody get wetin dem dey go through
I guess we all need someone, someone
A little spark in the dark now, in the dark now
I guess we all need someone, someone
Who would hold us down when it falls off
Hold somebody (hold somebody)
Hold somebody (hold somebody)
Hold somebody now (hold somebody)
Hold somebody
And tell them you love them (hold somebody)
Somebody (hold somebody)
Hold somebody (hold somebody)
Hold somebody (hold somebody)

Tell them you love them oh, oh
You love them oh, oh
