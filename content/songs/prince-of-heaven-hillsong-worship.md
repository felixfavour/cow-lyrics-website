Earth in shadow, restlessly hold
Labour's waiting, in silent hope
For the promise, it longs to know
What heaven holds
Then the angels, in holy haste
Lift their anthem, Your Saviour lays
In a manger, in humble form
Your King is born
Hail the Prince of Heaven comes
Angel choirs sound the call
For this babe wrapped in a cloth is
The incarnate Word of God
All the kingdom and its pow'r
Resting now in this child
Prince of Heaven
Jesus, hope of the world
This means mercy, in fullest form
Loving-kindness, forevermore
Son of David, and Son of God
He is Christ the Lord
