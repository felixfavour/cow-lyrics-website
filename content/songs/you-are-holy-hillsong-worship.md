[Intro]
Sing this
You are holy, holy
Lord there is none like You
You are holy, holy
Glory to You, my Lord
You are holy, holy
Lord there is none like You
You are holy, holy
Glory to You, my Lord
I sing Your praises forever
Deeper in love with You
Here in Your courts where I'm close to Your throne
I've found where I belong
I sing Your praises forever
Deeper in love with You
Here in Your courts where I'm close to Your throne
I've found where I belong
You are holy, holy
Lord there is none like You
You are holy, holy
Glory to You, my Lord
