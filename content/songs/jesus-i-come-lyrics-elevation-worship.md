Oh How I Need Your Grace
Jesus I Come, Jesus I Come
In All Weaknesses
You Are My Confidence
Jesus I Come, Jesus I Come
I will rise, stand redeemed
Heaven open over me
To Your name eternally
Endless glory I will bring
Oh what amazing love
We need Your cleansing flood
Jesus, I come
Jesus, I come
In every broken place
You are my righteousness
Jesus, I come
Jesus, I come
And I will rise, stand redeemed
Heaven open over me
To Your name eternally
Endless glory I will bring
I will rise, stand redeemed
Heaven open over me
To Your name eternally
Endless glory I will bring
