Tell me, what do you do
When you've done all you can do
And if seems like it's never enough
Tell me what do you say
When your friends turn away
And you're all alone, so alone
Tell me, what do you give
When you've given your all and
Seems like you can't make it through
Well, you just stand
When there's nothing left to do
You just stand
Watch the Lord see you through
Yes, after you've done all you can
You just stand
Tell me, how do you handle
The guilt of your past
Tell me, how do you deal with the shame
Tell me how can you smile
When your heart has been broken and filled with pain
Tell me, what do you give
When you've given your all
And if seems like you can't make it through
