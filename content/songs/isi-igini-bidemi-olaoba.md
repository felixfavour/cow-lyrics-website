Ah!
The Bible says
Once has he spoken
Twice have I heard
Once has he said it
That all power belongs to God

No matter what comes my way
I am victorious
No matter what they say
I am victorious
No matter what comes my way
I am victorious
No matter what they say
I am victorious
No matter what comes my way
I am victorious
No matter what they say
I am victorious

Who dey talk wetin God no talk
I no dey hear wetin devil talk
Who dey talk wetin God no talk
I no dey hear wetin devil talk

Soro
Mio gbo pa
Mio gbo po
I no hear wetin devil talk
A hin a a yan
You say
Isi gini
Ge ge
Isi gini

No matter what comes my way
I am victorious
No matter what they say
I am victorious
No matter what comes my way
I am victorious
No matter what they say
I am victorious

Listen
Once has he spoken
Twice have I heard
Once has he said it
That all power belongs to God
Jesu Kristi lo ba aye
Everybody fara m√≤
Jesu kristi lo ba aye
No need to dey shalaye

Eti mi o gbo
Ko gbo gbo ku gbo
Enu mi o so
Ko so so so ku so


No matter what comes my way
I am victorious
No matter what they say
Cause Olorun, Olorun got my back
I am victorious
No matter what comes my way
I am victorious
No matter what they say
Cause Olorun, Olorun got my back
I am victorious

Who dey talk wetin God no talk

Who dey talk wetin God no talk
I no dey hear wetin devil talk
