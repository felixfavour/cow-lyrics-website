Jesus Akamdinelu eh
(Jesus, my hands are lifted)
Jesus Ikperemdinala
(Jesus, my knees are on the ground)

Where would I be without You?
Where would I be without You?
Where would I be without You?
There's no me without You

Jesus Akamdinelu eh
(Jesus, my hands are lifted)
Jesus Ikperemdinala
(Jesus, my knees are on the ground)

My own strength failed me
Friends and family turned their back on me
Lord You stood by me
You never let me down

My own strength failed me
Friends and family turned their back on me
Lord You stood by me
You never let me down

Jesus, you are so good
What no man can do, 
You have done for me (2x)

I never see I never see
Wonder wonder wonder o

Blessed assurance,Jesus is mine!
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God
Born of his Spirit, washed in His blood

This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

OKAN mi yin Oba orun,
Mu ore wa sodo Re;
‘Wo t’ a wo san, t’ a dariji,
Tal’ a ba ha yin bi Re?

Yin Oluwa,
Yin Oba ainipekun.

Hallelujah Eh (hallelujah)!
Hallelujah O oh! (Hallelujah)!
Hallelujah Eh (Hallelujah)!
It's the sound of victory

Hallelujah Eh (Hallelujah)!
Hallelujah O oh (Hallelujah)!
Let the sound of rejoicing fill this house

Out of my belly
Shall flow rivers
Rivers of living waters
Iya iya eh

Yeshua
When we call You, You will answer
Yeshua
When we call You, You deliver

There's no name,
No name greater than Yours
There's no name,
No name greater than Yours

I will never be the same
I've touched Your Grace
My life has changed

I will never be the same
I've touched Your Grace
My life has changed
