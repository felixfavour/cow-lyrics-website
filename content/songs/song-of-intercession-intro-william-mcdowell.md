[Spoken intro]
It's so important that we surrender
'Cause there are things on the heart of the Father
That we can't even know until we posture ourselves
To surrender to what He wants
We've been... deceived by the enemy
In the area of prayer
Because, specifically--I know this will go around the world
But specifically in America
The most financially prosperous nation on the earth--
The enemy has deceived many parts of the church
By convincing us to continue praying for our own needs
When we have everything we can possibly imagine
If we were to heed the words of Jesus, he said:
Take no thought of what you will each
What you will drink, or what you will wear
For your Father knows that you have
Needed these things before you ask
It goes on later to say
Consider the lilies of the field:
They neither toil nor spin
Yet Solomon, the richest man that ever lived
In his glory, was never arrayed like one of these
God... knows what we have need of
