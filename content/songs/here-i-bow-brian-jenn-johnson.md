Where would I run
But to the throne of mercy
Where would I kneel
But at this cross of grace
How great the love
How strong the hand that holds us
Beautiful, so beautiful
So here, I bow, to lift You high
Jesus, be glorified
In all things, for all my life
I am Yours, forever Yours
There is a King
Who bore the scars of healing
There is a Son
Who came in grace and truth
How great the love
That carries us to kindness
Wonderful, Youâ€™re wonderful
So here, I bow, to lift You high
Jesus, be glorified
In all things, for all my life
I am Yours, forever Yours
