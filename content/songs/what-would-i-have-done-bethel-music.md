[Instrumental]
And I will not forget the cross
The pain that You endured for us
Where You carried brokenness and shame
Never to forget the day
Your love broke through to make a way
For hope to rise within my heart again
An overwhelming sacrifice
You freely paid the highest price
Suffering You traded blood for me
My heart will sing the deepest praise
My lips rejoice, my hands will raise
For the death that brought me into life
[Pre-Chorus: Brian Johnson]
And all for love
My Jesus, You gave all for love
I'm standing in the wonder of
Your great love (Your great love)
Overwhelming sacrifice
You freely paid the highest price
Suffering You traded blood for me
My heart will sing the deepest praise
My lips rejoice, my hands will raise
For the death that brought me into life
