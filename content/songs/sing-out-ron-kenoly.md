Sing out, the Lord is near
Build him a temple here
A palace of praise, a throne of thanksgiving
Made for the King of kings
Sing out a joyful song
His love goes on and on
When praises abound His glory surrounds us
Filling His temple here
Sing out the Lord is near
(Repeat chorus)
The Lord inhabits the
Song of His saints
And lives in their praises (2x)
(Repeat chorus)
We come to worship
Together as one
With music and singing
Rejoice in all that the
Father has done
Let's lift up an offering
(Repeat chorus)
