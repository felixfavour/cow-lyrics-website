One voice in the dark
A song that lights up the stars
One breath that gives life
One sovereign in power
Who speaks with thunder and fire
One Lord, one King
There is no other that can compare to You
You are
The One alone in greatness
The One who never changes
Jesus, You are
The One who rose in power
The One who reigns forever
Jesus, the One true God
One man on a cross
One light of the world
One Name, one Word
One Way to be saved
One Lamb that was slain
One Love above all
There is no other that can compare to You
