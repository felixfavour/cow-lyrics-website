This is our hope
This is our peace
Faithful is our God
He will come through
He won't be moved
Faithful is our God
This is our strength
This is our shield
Faithful is our God
He cannot fail
He will prevail
Faithful is our God
Oh, yes we are standing
â€˜Cause the enemy's defeated
We'll always be standing
On the promises of Jesus
Lifting our eyes
Won is the night
Faithful is our God
His enemies
Under our feet
Faithful is our God
