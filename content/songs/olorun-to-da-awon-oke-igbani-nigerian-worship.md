Olorun t'o da awon Oke Igbani
(Oh God who created mountains of those days)

Only You we give all our praise
(Eyin ni mo fi Okpe me fun)

T'ani N'wo tun gbe ga O
(Who else must be lifted up)

Bi Ko se Baba l'oke?
(If not You our Father?)

Tani N'wo tun fi gbogbo okpe mi fun
(Who then must be given all my praise)
