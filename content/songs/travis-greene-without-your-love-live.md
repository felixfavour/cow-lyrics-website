we rise and declare
that no one no where compares to your love
you are holy
we stand and we shout
we can't live without your love
for you are holy God
oh oh oh oh oh oh
forever you are holy God
oh oh oh oh oh oh
forever you are holy God
your love is air it's everywhere
we breathe you in
nothing compares to the great love you have for us
forever you are holy
you hold it all together
our world is in your hands
your love lasts forever
we breathe you in
now we can't live
we rise and declare
that no one no where compares to your love
you are holy
we stand and we shout
we can't live without your love
for you are holy God
oh oh oh oh oh oh
forever you are holy God
oh oh oh oh oh oh
forever you are holy God
you hold it all together
our world is in your hands
your love lasts forever
we breathe you in
now we can't live
you hold it all together
our world is in your hands
your love lasts forever
we breathe you in
now we can't live without you
we can't live without you
we can't live without your love
it gives us grace
it gives us you are holy
we can't live without your love (repeat thrice)
oh oh oh we can't live without your love (twice)
