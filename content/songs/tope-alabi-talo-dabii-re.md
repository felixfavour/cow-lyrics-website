ti:04 Talo Dabii Re]
Ask me who is Jesus
Then I will tell you things he has done for me
Ask me why I love him
Then I will tell you how much he loved me
When I've met him at all
Oun lo wami ri nigba ti mo rino shako
Oun lo we mi ninu eje re

His name is Jesus
He's unmoved
Unchanged
And defeated
Tested and trusted
He has done it for me
And he will do more over and over again
Alagba bi rere ni jesu mio riri
Oun lo few a ni afeju

Olusho aguntan rere

Nobody like him
Nobody like my Jesus
Nobody like my saviour
