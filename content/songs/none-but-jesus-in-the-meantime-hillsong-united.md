In the quiet, in the stillness
I know that You are God
In the secret of Your presence
I know there I am restored
[Pre-Chorus]
When You call, I won't refuse
Each new day, again I'll choose
There is no one else for me
None but Jesus
Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise
In the chaos, in confusion
I know You're sovereign still
In the moment of my weakness
You give mะต grace to do Your will
[Pre-Chorus]
When You call, I won't delay
This my song through all my days
