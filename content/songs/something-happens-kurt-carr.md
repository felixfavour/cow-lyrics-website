Jesus
Something special
Supernatural
About your name
Jesus
Something happens
When I mention your name
Demons has to flee when I say Jesus (Jesus)
Sickness has to heal when I say Jesus (Jesus)
Every knee shall bow before
And every tongue proclaim
With worthy praise
That matchless name of Jesus
Jesus
Something special
Supernatural
About your name
Jesus
Something happens
When I mention your name
When I call upon Your name
The very atmosphere will have to change
We'll be transformed
We'll never be the same
By the power of Your Holy name
Jesus

Everybody here stand on your feet real quick, please, please
On the count of three, say your first name: one-two-three

One-two-three, Jesus!
