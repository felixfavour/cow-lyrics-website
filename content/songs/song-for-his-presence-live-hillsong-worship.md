I've heard of wonders, ancient mysteries
The things of Heaven, my eyes have never seen
I wanna know it
Won’t You make it real for me?
'Cause I've read the stories of faith, and I believe
You’re still restoring, redeeming everything
Here in this moment
May Your will be done in me (Won't you sing?)
[Pre-Chorus: Aodhan King]
'Cause I will run
Like a child to their mother
To the safety of thе Father
To the place whеre I belong
And Lord, Your love
Could I ever understand it?
There's just something about Your presence
That leaves me wanting more
So, I'll bring my burdens and insecurities
Run to the throne room and fall down at Your feet
Won't waste a moment
But You've come to set me free
