Glory, glory to God in the highest
Glory, glory to God
When nothing else could help
You came and rescued me
Your love lifted me, Your love lifted me
Your love lifted me
I am free to sing of Your love
Glory, glory to God in the highest
Glory, glory to God
When nothing else could help
You came and rescued me
Your love lifted me, Your love lifted me
Your love lifted me
I am free to sing of Your love
(x2)
Hallelujah
It's Your love
It's Your love
Yeah
Higher, higher, higher than heaven
Deeper, deeper, deeper than oceans
Greater, greater, greater than mountains
Your love
(x4)
When nothing else could help
You came and rescued me
(x2)
When I was all alone
You came and rescued me
(x2)
When I was down and out
You cam and rescued me
(x3)
Your love lifted me, Your love lifted me
Your love lifted me
I am free to sing of Your love
