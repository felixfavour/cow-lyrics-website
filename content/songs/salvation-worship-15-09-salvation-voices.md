There is only one name
There is only one name
With power to save
With power to save
Say "There is only one name"
There is only one name

With power to save

And our God is champion
He reigns forevermore
Forevermore
Say "Our God"
Our God is champion
He reigns forevermore
Forevermore

Atmosphere shift now
Chains be broken, breakout
Holy Spirit come now
Heaven open, heaven open

No power of hell, no scheme of man,
can ever pluck me from his hand;
till he returns or calls me home,
here in the power of Christ Iâ€™ll stand!
