y should I be afraid
In You my world is safe
Safe in You
Why should I be afraid
In You my world is safe
Safe in You
Summer skies
Winter nights
Spring or Fall
My heart knows that You are with me through it all
The highest heights
Deepest depths
Twists and turns
You're the ground I stand on so I'll never fall
So why should I be afraid
Yeah
When You're my home, my everlasting stay
Oh why should I be afraid
When in You my world is safe
Why should I be afraid
In you my world is safe
Safe in You
Why should I be afraid
You hold my world in Your hands
My world in Your hands
I am safe I am sure
It's safe in You oh
Why should I be afraid
Oh ooo
