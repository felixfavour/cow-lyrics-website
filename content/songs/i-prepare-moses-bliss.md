Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I prepare
I prepare my heart
For the life that is to come
I prepare my heart
For the joy of meeting Jesus
I prepare my heart
For the coming endless life (Lord, I prepare)
I prepare my heart
To hear, "Well-done faithful servant"I prepare, I prepare
For the coming of Jesus
I prepare, I preparе
For the coming of the Lord
No room for distractions
No room for the flеsh
Daily I sow to the Spirit
'Cause my life is from above
My head is on the plough
I'm never looking back
I'm climbing up this mountain
And the Lord is waiting for me
Let no man bother me 'cause I am
Marked with the mark of Christ, oh
I am going to see the Lord, so I prepare
