It was meant for evil
But God has turned it around for your good
That it may accomplish you and set forth your purpose
He is the author and finisher of your fate
The God of the rewrite
May these lyrics bless you
What was meant to hurt you
Hurt you
Helped you
What was meant to shake you
What was meant to shake you
Accomplished you
What was meant to wake you
God used it to make you
You've been rewritten
Rewritten by the King
You've been rewritten by the King, listen
You know you can't control events
You can't control
That life may bring
Events life bring
But you can control how you respond
But you can control how you respond to them
No, you can't move on to the next chapter of your life
You can't move on to the next chapter
If you keep rereading chapters past, oh-oh-oh-ooh
If you keep rereading all the chapters past
