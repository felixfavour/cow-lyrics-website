Chant
 
Here and now,
We're the light,
We're as free as the light,
 
Like the rays of the sun,
Run into every corner,
 
We are up ahead and the world 's gotta follow,
We are not afraid, cos w'll never ever know defeat
 
Chant
 
We have joy,
We have mercy,
They all belong to the age to come,
 
We have forgiveness,
We're pure and holy by the precious blood of the Lamb
 
We are that generation who live ahead of our time,
We live in this world by the powers of the age to come
 
By the powers of the age to come
 
We will never ever know defeat by the powers of the age to come
 
We are up ahead and it's the worlds gotta follow,
We are not afraid cos we'll never ever know defeat
 
We are that generation who live ahead of our time,
We live in this world by the powers of the age to come
 
By the powers of the age to come
 
We will never ever know defeat,
By the powers of the age to come
We are up ahead and it's the worlds gotta follow,
We are not afraid cos we'll never ever know defeat
We are that generation who live ahead of our time,
We live in this world by the powers of the age to come
