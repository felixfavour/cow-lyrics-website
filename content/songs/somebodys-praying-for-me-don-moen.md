I was lost in a desert land
So dry and thirsty
But God was there where He'd always been
Giving grace and mercy
So hard to sing and hard to pray
Yet I knew His Word was true
And then one day my faith returned
And suddenly I knew
Somebody's praying for me
Somebody's knocking on Heaven's door
Somebody's praying for me
Somebody's lifting me up to the Lord
I knew it had to be
Somebody down on their knees
Somebody praying for me
I've been spared by so many prayers
How many times I could not say
What a difference a prayer can make
When it's offered up in faith
God has always made a way
When I didn't know what to do
Just when I needed a miracle
That's when your prayers broke through
