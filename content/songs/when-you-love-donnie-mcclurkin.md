(I wanna take the time to tell you, oh my)
Life is lovely, oh so lovely
Live is lovely when you love
It?s exciting, and inviting
Life is lovely when you love
Love is patient, Love is kind, and
Love is the key to life?s peace of mind
Oh, It's exciting when you love
When you love
Be inspired, so inspired
Be inspired when you love
Be inspired, hold on tighter
Be inspired when you love
Write them a poem, or sing them a song
Draw them painting, walk arm-in-arm
Be inspired when you love
When you love
Be romantic, so romantic
Be romantic when you love
Be romantic, so romantic
Be romantic when you love
Draw in the sand, or write in the sky
Tell them you?ll love them till the day that you die
