Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes and let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
Altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
King of all days, oh so highly exalted
You're glorious in heaven above, yes You are
Humbly You came to this Earth You created
All for love's sake became poor
Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You're my God
Altogether lovely, altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin up on that cross
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sin up on that cross
