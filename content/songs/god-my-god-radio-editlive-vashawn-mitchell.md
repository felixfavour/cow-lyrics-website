I've never thought I was worthy of Your grace
But You gave it to me anyway
And if I took all day
It wouldn't be long enough for me
To express my gratitude
You never remind me of my mistakes
But You show me my destiny
What an awesome God You are
You're an awesome, awesome God
What an awesome God You are
You're an awesome, awesome God
You hold the world in Your hand;
Such an awesome God You are
The winds and the waves obey Your command;
What a mighty God You are
There is no one like You, God
You're awesome, so awesome
Who am I that you're mindful of me?
What an awesome God You are
You're awesome... so awesome...
You're awesome... so awesome...
What an awesome God You are
