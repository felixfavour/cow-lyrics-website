You rendered heaven
The veil was torn in two
It gave us Your Spirit
Now we are close, closer than we think
Creation is groaning
Longing for the unseen
Here in this moment
Eternity's close, closer than we think
[Pre-Chorus]
What are they singing?
What is it like?
You are surrounded with thunder and light
Everything in us
The longing, the ache
To join with the heavens
The anthem of praise
Holy
Holy
Holy
Holy
The train of His robe
Filling the temple
The elders and angels
All bowing down, casting their crowns
The Lamb who was slain
You are the risen King
Jesus, our Savior
Alpha Omega, end to beginning
