[Chorus: Maribeth Johnson]
Jesus, we lift you on our praises
So every eye can see your face your power and grace
Behold you as you really are
Brighter than all the stars of heaven
Our worship is for you alone
We build you this throne of praise
As long as I have breath
I'll find a way to say that I love you
Every thing may change and world may pass away
I'll still Love you
With every song we sing
Every prayer we pray
We'll build you a throne
Made from the sound of praise
You O Lord deserve the praise of all the earth
And we worship You
A Sacrifice you died now great and glorified
And we worship You
With every song we sing
Every prayer we pray
We'll build you a throne
Made from the sound of praise
