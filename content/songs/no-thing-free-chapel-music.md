Alive in truth called by Your name
Purchased by love my life reclaimed
For who You justified, Lord, You glorified
If God is for us who can be against us
All else fades Your love remains
No thing will ever separate You and me
No thing at all, all, all
No thing will ever separate You and me
No thing at all
Alive in truth called by Your name
Purchased by love my life reclaimed
For who You justified, Lord, You glorified
If God is for us who can be against us
All else fades Your love remains
No thing will ever separate You and me
No thing at all, all, all
No thing will ever separate You and me
No thing at all
[x2]
All, all, all
No thing at all
[x4]
