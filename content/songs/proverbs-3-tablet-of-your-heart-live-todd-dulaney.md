Write them on the tablet of your heart
Write them on the tablet of your heart
I am the Vine, you are the branches
He who abides in Me
Will forever be fruitful indeed
I am the Way, the Truth and the Light
No one gets to the Father
Except that he comes through Me
Let not mercy and truth
Forsake you, forsake you
...
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
Trust in the Lord with all your mind
Trust in the Lord with all your strength
Lean not to your own und–µrstanding
...
I will hide Your word in my heart...
