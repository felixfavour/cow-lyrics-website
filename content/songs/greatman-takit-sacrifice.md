They say we no go ever make am oh until we join illuminati
I tel them say Papsie don do the sacrifice
Omo na with him blood and him body
They say we no go ever make am oh until we join illuminati
I tel them say Papsie don do the sacrifice
Omo na with him blood and him body
Yeah
My father no dey tire for me
Baba dey gimme money
Baba dey put me on the kind cruise wey dey chill for body
the type of blessing wey be sey e no dey finish for real
I get my blessings from the blood of the lamb that was spilled
The covenant is everlasting
A pure act of mercy
Person wey die for me before I reason to be anything
Before my daddy ever dreamt of being mommie's bestie
My destiny was planned already now it's manifesting
The blessing no be money don't you ever get it twisted fam
My body, soul and spirit prosperity hope you listening
My kind of wealth will never be dependent on your currency
My bank is from a river and I'm moving with the currency
It's heavenly economy
And others trying to copy me
Even your babalawo knows the truth man no apologies
It's only one eternal sacrifice the rest na wannabes
My eyes are on the lamb slain on calvary

They say we no go ever make am oh until we join illuminati
I tel them say Papsie don do the sacrifice
Omo na with him blood and him body
They say we no go ever make am oh until we join their society
I tel them say Papsie don do the sacrifice
Omo na with him blood and him body
Say my Father
My Father
Na your sacrifice
Na your sacrifice
Say my Father
My Father
Na your sacrifice
Na your sacrifice
