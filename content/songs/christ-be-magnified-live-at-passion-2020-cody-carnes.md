Were creation suddenly articulate
With a thousand tongues to lift one cry
Then from north to south and east to west
We’d hear, "Christ be magnified"Were the whole earth echoing His eminence
His name would burst from sea and sky
From rivers to the mountaintops
We’d hear, "Christ be magnified"O Christ be magnified
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me
O Christ be magnified
From the altar of my lifе
Christ be magnified in me
Whеn every creature finds its inmost melody
And every human heart its native cry
O then in one enraptured hymn of praise
We’ll sing, "Christ be magnified"Yes! This is what we're made to do right here!
We give You praise, Jesus! Come on!
