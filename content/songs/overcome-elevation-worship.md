Now the darkness fades
Into new beginnings
As we lift our eyes to a hope beyond
All creation waits
With an expectation
To declare the reign of the Lord our God
We will not be moved
When the earth gives way
For the risen One has overcome
And for every fear
There's an empty grave
For the risen One has overcome
Now the silence breaks
In the name of Jesus
As the heavens cry let the earth respond
All creation shouts
With a voice of triumph
To declare the reign of the Lord our God
We will not be moved
When the earth gives way
For the risen One has overcome
And for every fear
There's an empty grave
For the risen One has overcome
