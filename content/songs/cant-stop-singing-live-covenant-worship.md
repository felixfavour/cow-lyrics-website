Your grace for me will always be
More than enough, more than enough
The power of Jesus Christ in me
Is more than enough, more than enough
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Because my heart is full and my soul is free
In my weakness, You had a plan for me
And I can't stop singing about Your love
No, I can't stop singing about Your love
Jesus, forever You will be more than enough
No, I can't stop, no, I can't stop
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-ooh
You will provide, You will supply
More than enough, more than enough
Open Heaven, open wide
More than enough, more than enough
