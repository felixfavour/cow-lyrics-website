When the battle makes me weary
It seems that I've lost ground
It's so hard to hear Your voice Lord
With distractions all around
I try to lift my hands, to give You praise
But then a spirit of heaviness
Tries to shield Your face, so I'm saying breathe
Breathe into me oh Lord, the breath of life
So that my spirit would be whole
And my soul made right
Breathe into me oh Lord, day by day
So that my heart is pure before You, always, always
Unto Thee oh Lord do I lift up my soul
It's only by Your hand
That I can be made whole
So Lord breathe on me
And revive my spirit within
And I'll never be the same
Breathe into me oh Lord, the breath of life
So that my spirit would be whole
And my soul made right
Breathe into me oh Lord, day by day
So that my heart is pure before You, always, always
Condemnation tries to hold me
Like a prisoner in chains
And the weight of my burdens
Is calling out my name
That's when I lift up my voice worship You
Because I know
You promised You would wash me
Jesus wash me white as snow
Unto Thee oh Lord do I lift up my soul
It's only by Your hand, that I can be made whole
So Lord let Your breath revive me again
And I'll never be the same
I will never be the same, I will never be the same
Breathe into me oh Lord, the breath of life
So that my spirit would be whole
And my soul made right
Breathe into me oh Lord, day by day
So that my heart is pure before You, always, always
