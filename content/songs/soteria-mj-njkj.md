Uh, peace when I'm rollin' around
Tried to keep me close, but look how

When I needed you the most you was out
The least I can do is account

Pizzeria dough, big amount
Fire in the hole, burnin' out his soul

Like they seen a ghost in a shell
Froze up, it's colder than Hell
I cleaned up most of myself
I peeled off more dollar bills

Four on when they peeled off on the bill
Started at the bottom of the hill

Actually, I started in the mid
Actually, I started in Illinois, Khoikhoi and Tswana in the kid

Bloodstains on my fatherland
Bloodstains on my motherland

Tuck clay, all of it's red
Stuck in the jeans and the fabric
And the twenty-three little strains
Freddie Hubbard sing through the acts

Chop another piece off the branch
Memories careen out the past
Halt me to a screech in they tracks
Had a couple things on my chest

That's where the demons would sit
I took a seat at the head, it's time to eat
I need to breach, heavy set
Can you dig what I'm sayin'?

Notice that you easily led
So I take a seat at the head
It's time to eat
