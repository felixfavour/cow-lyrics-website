I need words, deeper than the ocean
And I need a voice, that's bigger than the sky
And I need a song, that's worthy of Your nail scars
To sing of the love, that took a chance on me
Yeah, this is more
'Cause this is more than I could ask for, and more than I could dream
The One who made the world, somehow thinks the world of me
The highest King of Heaven, He chose to love a fool
I don't understand it, but I know I want nothing more than You
And I thought God, was further than horizons
And I thought grace, was just beyond my reach
But You said my life Father, it was worthy of Your nail scars
So I'll sing like it was, 'cause You took a chance on me
This is morе, hey!
Now this is more than I could ask for, more than I could drеam
The One who made the world, somehow thinks the world of me
Highest King of Heaven, He chose to love a fool
I don't understand it, but I know I want nothing more than You, oh yeah
I want nothing more than You
