The word of the lord says
The race is not to the swift
Food is not to the wise
But it is the lord that showeth mercy
It is the lord that showeth favour
That is why I want to prophecy to you somebody
That you are about to receive the favour of the lord in your life
Somebody get ready because the favour of the lord is your portion
In the name of Jesus

I didn't know you will favour me this way
I never know you will favour me this way
I didn't know you will favour me this way
Favour me this way, thank you Jesus

I didn't know that the Lord will favour me this way
I never know you will favour me this way
I didn't know you will favour me this way
Favour me this way, thank you Jesus

Onyame m'anka bi anhyemu
Sɛ wobɛyɛ me nipa kɛseɛ sɛ eyi
Ohene m'ansusu kraa sɛ wobɛyɛ me nipa kɛseɛ sɛ eyi
Eh m'anna anwene ho da sɛ wobɛpepa m'aniwa mu nisuo nyinaa o
Awurade bɛpepa m'aniwa mu nisuo nyinaa o
Medawoase daa
Bible says David said
Is there anyone left in the house of Saul
That I David I will show him favour?
Somebody the lord is about to remember you
Somebody you are about to see the favour of the lord
Somebody you are about to step into your next level
And this is going to be your song, this is going to be your song
Jesus I didn't know You will favor me this way
Favour, favour, favour I didn't know You will favour me this way
Favour me this way, thank You Jesus
Emmanuel you've been faithful to me
Elohim, you've been faithful to me
O my saviour you've been faithful too me
Faithful to me, faithful to me
Emmanuel you've been faithful to me
Elohim, you've been faithful to me
O Jehovah you've been faithful too me
Faithful to me, faithful to me
I didn't know you will favour me this way
I didn't know you will favour me this way
I didn't know, I didn't know you will favour me this way
Favour me this way, thank you Jesus
Somebody receive the touch of God
Receive the uncommon favour
Receive the grace to your next level
The lord is healing diseases
The lord is healing hypertension
The lord is delivering somebody from oppression
Somebody is receiving promotion
Anointing of the lord is coming upon somebody
The favour of the lord is touching somebody
The favour of the lord is locating you
I can see the favour is locating you
The favour is changing levels
The favour of the lord is changing your level
In the name of Jesus
Come on receive it
Come on receive the power of God
Onyame rema wo adom
Onyame resa wo yareɛ
Onyame regye wo, Onyame resesa wo hyɛbrɛ
Wo nso woawareɛ kwan no abue, woakwantuo kwan no abue
Woasofodie mu nneɛma resesa, wo nwomtoɔ mu nneɛma resesa
I see a change, I see a transformation
Receive it! receive it! in the name of Jesus
I can feel the fresh oil
