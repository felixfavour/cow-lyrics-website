Whether now or then
Death is not my end
I know Heaven waits for me
Though the road seems long
I'll never walk alone
And I got all I need to sing
I know You love me
I know You found me
I know You saved me
And Your grace will never fail me
And while I'm waiting
I'm not waiting
I know Heaven lives in me
And though the night is dark
Heaven owns my heart
And I got all I need to sing
I know You love me
I know You found me
I know You saved me
And Your grace will never fail me
And while I'm waiting
I'm not waiting
I know Heaven lives in me
So I will sing like I will there
In the fearless light of glory
Where the darkness cannot find me
And Your face is all I see
Oh I will sing like a man
With no sickness in my body
Like no prison walls can hold me
I will sing like I am free
'Cause I know You love me
I know You found me
I know You saved me
And Your grace will never fail me
And while I'm waiting
I'm not waiting
I know Heaven lives in me
I know You love me
I know You found me
I know You saved me
And Your grace will never fail me
And while I'm waiting
I'm not waiting
I know Heaven lives in me
So I will sing like I will there
In the fearless light of glory
Where the darkness cannot find me
And Your face is all I see
Oh I will sing like a man
With no sickness in my body
Like no prison walls can hold me
I will sing like I am free
'Cause I know You love me
I know You found me
I know You saved me
And Your grace will never fail me
And while I'm waiting
Oh I'm not waiting
I know Heaven lives in me
I'll sing Holy, Holy
My heart, cries Holy
As it is, in Heaven
It is in me
I'll sing Holy, Holy
My heart, cries Holy
As it is, in Heaven
It is in me
We'll sing Holy, Holy
The earth, cries Holy
As it is, in Heaven
So let it be
We'll sing Holy, Holy
The earth, cries Holy
As it is, in Heaven
So let it be
We'll sing Holy, Holy
The earth, cries Holy
As it is, in Heaven
So let it be
We'll sing Holy, Holy
The earth, cries Holy
As it is, in Heaven
So let it be
