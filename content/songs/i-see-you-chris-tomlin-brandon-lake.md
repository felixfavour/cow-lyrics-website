God of love, God of all glory
Every day I see new mercy
Great is Your faithfulness
God of love, God of my story
You never fail, You never forsake me
Great is Your faithfulness
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin & Brandon Lake]
I see You in the morning light
I feel You in the fire by night
I hear You say, "Child, I am with you
Everything will be alright."I see You in the tears that run
I feel You when the healing comes
I hear You say, "Beloved one, I am with you."Every moment of my life
I see You (Oh, I see You)
I see You (Oh, I see You)
I see You
God, I see You
God of love, God of new vision
Every blessing You have given
Great is Your faithfulness
Oh, how gr–µat is Your faithfulness
