In this house we've built of make-believe
Loved ones go long before, seems it's time to leave
But we'll learn how to grieve
To forgive and receive
Till we see them there in that city
Span of stars overhead as we walk this road
While the darkness remains I will bear your load
And together we'll tend the seed He's sown
As we walk along the road to that city
On that day we will sing holy, holy
On that day we'll bow down in the light
And then we'll rise and turn our eyes
To the One who's the Light
Light of that city
Though my eyes can't see what is waiting there
Though my mind can't conceive all that He's prepared
There the blind will see the sun
What was old will be young
And the lame, they will run
All over the streets of that city
On that day we will sing holy, holy
On that day we'll bow down in the light
And then we'll rise and turn our eyes
To the One who's the Light
