I hear the sound of revival
Deep in the hearts of your people
Send it now, we want it now
I hear the sound of revival
Deep in the hearts of your people
Send it now, we need it now
[Pre-Chorus]:
Release your Glory, Send your Glory
We're hungry, we're thirsty for you, we want you
We're patiently waiting for you, we need you
We're hungry, we're thirsty for you, we want you
We're patiently waiting for you, we need you
[Chorus-1]:
Lord we will wait for you
Cause all we want is you
Ohh...
That's why we wait for you
Cause nothing else will do
[Vamp-1]:
We've been praying, we've been sowing
Now we've crying, heaven send the rain
We've been praying, we've been sowing
Now we've crying, heaven send the rain
Send the rain
We've been praying, we've been sowing
Now we've crying, heaven send the rain
Send the rain
We've been praying, we've been sowing
Now we've crying, heaven send the rain
Send the rain
We're hungry, we're thirsty for you, we want you
We're patiently waiting for you, we need you
