I'm not ashamed to tell the whole world, ohh
Without You, I'm nothing at all, all
That I have strings in need of mendin'
I'm out of tune in certain parts
So strong, the chords of mercy
Restore my soul completely
Lay Your hand upon me
And this instrument will breathe
'Cause You're the music of my heart
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The melody within my soul
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The song that holds me in the dark
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The fire that warms me when I'm cold
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The symphony that calms my fear
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The lyric that I long to hear
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The masterpiece, the work of art
Complete before I start, the music of my heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
