Thanks, thanks, I give you thanks
For all you've done
I am so blessed, my soul has found rest
Oh Lord, I give You thanks
Thank You, Lord, for the strength You give
To carry on through life's toils and tests
And the worst and best, I'm not ever left alone
You were always right beside me
You hear me every time I pray
And since I first began, You've been my dearest friend
And I give You all the praise
