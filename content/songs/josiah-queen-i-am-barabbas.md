ey said that this preacher man
Comes from Galilee
Did something so absurd that he deserved this penalty
How can it be?
I know I've done my wrongs
And doing wrong is something I do well
I know the court of law and something like this doesn't ring a bell
How can it be?
How can this be?
I am Barabbas
You took upon my cross
I was that prisoner
Till you bought my bond with blood
I can't run away
From what my accusers say
I am Barabbas your friend
They made me sit right there
As I watched them beat the preacher man
39 of all them lashes should've been on my own skin
How can it be?
How can this be?
I am Barabbas
You took upon my cross
I was that prisoner
Till you bought my bond with blood
I can't run away
From what my accusers say
I am Barabbas your friend
I'll never comprehend the
Repercussions of my every sins
Is this love?
Or is this hatred flowing  out from bitterness
How can it be?
But he looked at me
And I said
I am Barabbas
You took upon my cross
I was that prisoner
Till you bought my bond with blood
I can't run away
From what my accusers say
I am Barabbas
I am Barabbas
I am Barabbas your friend
