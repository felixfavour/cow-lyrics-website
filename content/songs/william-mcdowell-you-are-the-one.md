You are the one that I need
The song I sing
The air I breathe
Just can't explain the things You do
Nobody else compares to You
There's no other help that I know
No other place that I could go
You are my strength when I get weak
Father, Your face is all I see
All I see
It's all I see
Just when I feel I'm all alone
When I feel my strength is gone
That's when You come and rescue me
Reminding me back to set me free
There's nobody else that can compare
Am never alone, You're always there
Goodness and mercy follow me
Father, Your face is all I see
All consuming fire
My heart's desire
Your face is all I see
You are the one I need
All consuming fire
My heart's desire
Your face is all I see
You are the one
All consuming fire
My heart's desire
Your face is all I see
You are the one I need
All consuming fire
My heart's desire
Your face is all I see
You are the one I need...
Say King Jesus (King Jesus)
My Saviour (my Saviour)
Forever (forever)
And ever (and ever)
You are the one I need
You're the one that I need, oh (You are the one I need)
King Jesus (King Jesus)
My Saviour (my Saviour)
Forever (forever)
And ever (and ever)
You are the one I need...
Oh, I need You, Lord
To come to my rescue
Come to my rescue
Oh, where else, where else, where else can I go
I need You
You're my safety, Lord
My hiding place
You're my hiding place
Oh, I need You...
I can't breathe, can't breathe without You, Lord...
You're the one that I need, oh
