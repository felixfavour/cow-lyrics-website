I believe You gave sight to the blind
I believe that the dead came to life
I believe there were wonders and signs
And You're still the same
I believe every word that You said
I believe there are scars in Your hands
That Your goodness is good without end
And You'll never change
I will tell of Your wonders, sing of Your grace
Thе God of creation knows me by name
Thе Lord is faithful, yesterday, now, and always
Always
Your mercy is mighty, age after age
And all generations will bow down and praise
The Lord is faithful, yesterday, now, and always
Always
I believe You will come in the clouds
I believe You are here even now
In Your presence, I know there is power
Power to save, oh
