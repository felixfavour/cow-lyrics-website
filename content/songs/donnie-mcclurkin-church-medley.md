We've come this far by faith
Leaning on the Lord
Trusting in His holy word
He never failed me yet
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Can't turn around
We've come this far by faith
We've come this far by faith
Leaning on the Lord
Trusting in His holy word
He never failed me yet
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Can't turn around
We've come this far by faith
I will trust in the Lord
I will trust in the Lord
I will trust in the Lord 'til I die
I will trust in the Lord
I will trust in the Lord
I will trust in the Lord 'til I die
I'm gonna stay on the battlefield
I'm gonna stay on the battlefield
I'm gonna stay on the battlefield 'til I die
I'm gonna stay on the battlefield
I'm gonna stay on the battlefield
I'm gonna stay on the battlefield 'til I die
I'm gonna treat everybody right
I'm gonna treat everybody right
I'm gonna treat everybody right 'til I die
I'm gonna treat everybody right
I'm gonna treat everybody right
I'm gonna treat everybody right 'til I die
