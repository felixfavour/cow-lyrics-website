Sweet Jesus
You're the wind beneath my wings
Sweet Jesus
You are my melody and harmony
Sweet Jesus
You're the eyes
that I see through
Sweet Jesus
Yes I'm dancing to your tune
For as the deer pants for water
So my soul longs for you
Forever and ever , Yes!
My heart beats for you
For as the deer pants for water
So my soul longs for you
Forever and ever, Yes!
My heart beats for you
Something more than Gold
I've got something more than Gold
Something more than Gold
I've got something more than Gold
If all I've got is Jesus
I've got something more than Gold
I'd tell it to the world
Jesus is more than Gold
More than gold more then gold
I've got something more then gold
I'd tell it to the world
Jesus is more than Gold
It's such an honour that you call me your own
Your love is unchangeable
Keeps coming after me
Shepherd of my Heart
I love the way You love me
Treasure of my soul
I stand in awe of You
For as the deer pants for waters
So my soul longs for you
Forever and ever, Yes!
My heart beats for you
As the deer pants for waters
So my soul longs for you
Forever and ever, Yes!
My heart beats for you
Something more then Gold
Something more then Silver
Something more then Life
I've got something more than riches
If all I got is Jesus
I've got something more then Gold
I'd tell it to the world
Jesus is more than Gold
More than gold more than gold
I've got something more than gold
More than gold more than gold
Jesus is more than Gold
Something more than gold
Something more than silver
The spirit of the Lord within me
Is something more than gold
Something more than gold
Something more than silver
The spirit of the Lord within me
Is something more than gold
More than gold more than gold
I've got something more than gold
I'd tell it to the world
Jesus is more than gold
More than gold more than gold
I've got something more than Gold
My brother my sister
Jesus is more than gold
More than riches you are
Everything to me o God
More than life Jesus is more than Gold
