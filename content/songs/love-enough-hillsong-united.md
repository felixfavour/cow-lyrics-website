Your love's enough to see the broken hearts
Gain a brand new start with a brand new heart
As the faithful hope in things unseen
You're enough to see
All the things they dream come to life
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're living in the Saviour today
And this day is what we have now
In this moment we have chosen to praise
And it's changing how we live now
Your love it broke my fall
It's more than enough and I need it
'Cause I've never known better
And I'll never know better
This love will see me soar
It's more than enough and I need it
'Cause I've never known better
And I'll never know better
Your love's enough to see the humbled man
Find the cause of Christ with His outstretched hands
As the cripple grabs his mat to walk
You're enough to save him from the pain he bore
