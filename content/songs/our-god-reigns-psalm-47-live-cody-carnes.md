[Chorus]
Our God reigns
Oh, our God reigns
Forever, Your kingdom reigns
Our God reigns
Oh, our God reigns
Forever, Your kingdom reigns
Oh, our God reigns
Our God reigns
Forever, Your kingdom reigns
You reign, You reign, Jesus
You reign, You reign, Jesus
[Instrumental]
Jesus reigns above it all
We praise the name of Jesus
We exalt, oh
Oh, clap your hands, all you people
Shout to God with a voice of triumph and songs of joy
For the Lord most high, He is to be feared and worshipped
With all inspired reverence and obedience
Hallelujah
He is a great king over all the earth
God has ascended amid shouting
The Lord with the sound of a trumpet
Sing praises to God, sing praises
Sing praises to our King, sing praises
For God is king of all the earth
God reigns over the nations
God sits on his holy throne
For the shields of the earth belong to God
He is highly exalted
He is highly exalted
He is highly exalted, hey
