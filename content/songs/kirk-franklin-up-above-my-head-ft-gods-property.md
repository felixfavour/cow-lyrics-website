Up above my head, I hear music in the air
Up above my head, there's a melody so bright
And fair I can hear when I'm all alone
Even in those times when I feel all hope is gone
Up above my head, I hear joy bells ringing
Up above my head I hear angels singing
There must be a God somewhere
There must be a God somewhere
Up above my head, I hear music in the air
Up above my head, there's a melody so bright
And fair I can hear when I'm all alone
Even in those times when I feel all hope is gone
Up above my head, I hear joy bells ringing
Up above my head I hear angels singing
There must be a God somewhere
There must be a God somewhere
(Interlude - Jazz Singing)
I hear music in the air
I hear music everywhere
 (there must be a God somewhere)
I hear music in the air
I hear music everywhere
 (there must be a God somewhere)
I hear music in the air (I hear music in the air)
I hear music everywhere (everywhere)
There must be a God somewhere (there must be a God somewhere)
I hear music in the air (I hear music in the air)
I hear music everywhere (everywhere)
There must be a God somewhere (there must be a God somewhere)
I hear music in the air (I hear music in the air)
I hear music everywhere (everywhere)
There must be a God somewhere (there must be a God somewhere)
I hear music in the air I hear music everywhere
There must be a God somewhere (there must be a God somewhere)
There must be a God somewhere (some where far beyond the clouds)
There must be a God somewhere (some where far beyond the moon)
There must be a God somewhere (there must be a God somewhere)
There must be a God somewhere (there must be a God somewhere)
There must be a God somewhere (there must be a God somewhere)
There must be a God somewhere (somewhere)
