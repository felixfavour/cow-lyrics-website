You done burst my brain, oh
I'm no longer searching, oh, I'm certain
They must think I'm stupid, they must think I'm foolish
Young and foolish
It's been a long time
Ooh, I've been searching for a long time
Glad that I found you at the right time
Oh, you run in my mind, oh no
It's been a long time
Ooh, I've been searching for a long time
Glad that I found you at the right time
Oh, you run in my mind
I can't lose this loving, this loving, this loving
Don't wanna lose this loving, this loving, this loving
I can't lose this loving, this loving, this loving
Don't wanna lose this loving, this loving, this loving
I see what I've been missing, been too many seasons
But I never found the person, person for me
My mama has been calling, she wanna meet my lady
We'll make a happy family, baby you and me
We only get to live one life (one life)
Then I don't wanna waste no time (no time)
Do you see the stars tonight?
Maybe it's a sign
Baby girl, want you to live in my life (my life)
It's no accident you came by
Still believe in second chances, but
I can't lose this loving, this loving, this loving
Don't wanna lose this loving, this loving, this loving
I can't lose this loving, this loving, this loving
Don't wanna lose this loving, this loving, this loving
I don't wanna lose this loving, I don't wanna lose this loving
I don't wanna lose this loving, no, no no
I don't wanna lose this loving, I don't wanna lose this loving
I don't wanna lose this loving, oh my baby
