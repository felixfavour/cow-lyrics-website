Gathered in a crowded room
Trying to figure out
Just how it will go down
One hundred twenty waited for
The promise that he gave
The day he stepped up on that cloud
Mmmmm
Suddenly the wind began to blow
Where it came from they did not know
And those outside who heard
Thought it was absurd
Then peter said
Don't be dismayed
These are the last days
It's only the comforter
It came from above
Because of his love
Yes it's the comforter
These tongues that you hear
There's no need to fear
It's only the comforter
It's the spirit of the lord
They were all in one accord
Receive the comforter
In this present day and time
So much on my mind
It's easy to forget
Feeling broken and alone
Often afraid of the unknown
Creates my drama and my stress
And something inside begins to shake
Driving my darkness far away
And suddenly there's peace
As he gently speaks to me
I hear him say
Don't be dismayed
These are the last days
It's only the comforter
It came from above
Because of his love
Yes it's the comforter
These tongues that you hear
There's no need to fear
It's only the comforter
Let's get on one accord
Magnify the lord
And be blessed by the comforter
Only believe
You will receive
And rest assure
He will not leave
This promise is for you
And your sons and daughters too
Please hear me say
Don't be dismayed
These are the last days
It's only the comforter
Sent from above
Because of my god's love
He sent us the comforter
These tongues that you hear
There's no need to fear
It's only the comforter
Let's get on one accord and
Magnify the lord
Be blessed by the comforter
