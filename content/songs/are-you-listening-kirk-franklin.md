[Spoken: Kirk Franklin]
(I was hungry... You fed me. Naked... you clothed me
They will know us by our love.)
[BeBe Winans]
Can't imagine how it felt as you lay there
Through the dark, through the heat, through the cold
[Fred Hammond]
With your friend, by your side
Held his hand and watched him die
And you cried as you prayed for his soul
[Marvin Winans]
I can't imagine how it felt as you stood there
Through the winds that would just not go away
[Jeremy Camp]
Kiss my wife. Tell my son, 'My work on Earth is done.'
You're the One that can still hear them say...
[CeCe Winans]
Is there anybody out there listening?
And does anybody know my name?
No, my friend, we were not there
But we're here and we care...
And yes, we feel your pain
And yes, we feel your pain
