For the unclean, the unholy
For the broken, the unworthy
You came, Jesus you came
For the wounded, for the hurting
For the lost, and for the lonely
You came, Jesus you came
O come all ye faithful
Bow before our Savior
Come let us adore
The one who came for us
Glory in the highest
Praise the name of Jesus
Our King has come
For the outcast, the defeated
For the weary, for the weakest
You came, Jesus you came
O come let us adore him
For He alone is worthy
Our King has come
Our King has come
O give Him all the glory
For He alone is worthy
Our King has come
Our King has come
