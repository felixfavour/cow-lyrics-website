Chorus:
I have known the Father's care for me
He's been good, He's been good
Through it all He's always there for me
God's been good to me
Through the storms
Through the night
Come what may
Everything will be alright
I have known the Father's care for me
God's been good to me
(Chorus)
Through the storms
Through the night
Come what may
Everything is gonna be alright
I have known the Father's care for me
He's been good to me
Good so good
God's been good to me
Good so good
God's been good to me (x2)
