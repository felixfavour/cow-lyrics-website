Have you heard of the one called savior?
Have you heard of his perfect love?
Have you heard of the one in heaven?
Have you heard how he gave his son?
Coz I have found this love
Nd I believe in it so
Show Me Your Way
Jesus, you are my best friend
You will always be
Nothing will ever change that
Jesus, you are my best friend
You will always be
Nothing will ever change that
I believe in the one called savior
I believe he's the risen one
I believe that I'll live forever
I believe that my king will come
Coz I have found this love
Nd I believe in it so
Show Me Your Way

You will always be
Nothing will ever change that
Jesus, you are my best friend
