When all your hope is gone and there's nowhere to turn, it'll be alright
Though darkness surrounds your way everyday, it'll be alright (right...)
When all your friends are gone and there's nowhere to turn, it's never too late for Jesus
Though darkness surrounds your way everyday, it's never too late for Jesus
Never too late, He is there when you call
Never too late, He will break every wall
Never too late when you call on Jesus
Never too late for Him
He will be your light in your darkest night
It's never too late o o o oh
Never too late for Jesus
It's never too late, it'll be alright (right...)
It's never too late, it'll be alright
But your body is so weak, and you think you will die
It's never too late for Jesus
Though you think you are so poor, you've got no place to lie
It's never too late for Jesus
Never too late, He is there when you call
Never too late, He will break every wall
Never too late when you call on Jesus
Never too late for Him
He will be your light in your darkest night
It's never too late o o o oh
Never too late for Jesus
It's never too late, it'll be alright (right...)
It's never too late, it'll be alright eeeh
It's never too late, never too late, it'll be alright
I know it's never too late, never too late, it'll be alright
It's never too late, never too late, it'll be alright
He will turn your darkness to light
I know it's never too late, never too late, it'll be alright
He will lift you up and make you stand
It's never too late, never too late, it'll be alright
O o o oh it's never too late
