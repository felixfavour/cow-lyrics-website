Make a way for the love of God
Let the world know that He is near
Valleys rise and mountains will be moved
As our praise rises up to You
I will pray, I will pray
Chorus:
Let Your kingdom come, pray Your will be done
Nations will see Your fame
On the Lordâ€™s day
Coda:
I will pray, I will pray
I will pray, I will pray
