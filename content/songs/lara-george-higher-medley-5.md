As I woke to pray,
And I was going my way
I come hear God say
Beta dey today
As I woke to pray,
And I was going my way
I come hear God say
He has lifted me higher (higher, higher, higher)
He has lifted me higher
Above my enemies higher
Above yanmayanma higher
He has lifted me higher (higher, higher, higher)
He has lifted me so high
Above sedesede higher
Above wuruwuru higher
He has done me well (He has done me so well)
He has done me well (He has done me so well)
He has done me well (He has done me so well)
He has done me well (He has done me so well)

He has lifted me higher (higher, higher, higher)
He has lifted me higher
Above my enemies higher
Above yanmayanma higher
