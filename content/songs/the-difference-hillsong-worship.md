You are the difference in us
You've broken the past
And set us apart
You caused the darkness to end
You lifted our heads
To know you again
Pre-chorus:
Lord you bring us to life
In you our hope will arise
Chorus 1:
We are found
There's nothing that can hold us down
With anything against us
We know your love will be the difference
Be the difference
You defied reason with love
Took the fall meant for us
You alone are enough
Though we were destined to fail
You opened the way
And broke every chain
