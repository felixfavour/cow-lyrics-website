Lord I’ve Been Busy Here And There,
Till Life’s Burdens And It’s Pleasures.
Have Crowed Out My Prayers,
But Now I Find I’m Empty And If I Confess My Sin. Would You Let Me Feel Your Spirit Once Again.

Lord I Need To Feel Your Power And Joy In My Soul. And Sweet Peace That Comes When Jesus Has Control.
I Don’t Want To Walk This Road I Know Where It Ends. Would You Let Me Feel Your Spirit Once Again Please Let Me Feel Your Spirit Once Again.

I Remember Victory In My Soul,
And The Close Sweet Fellowship We Share. Wake Joyful Rivers Flow,
And I’ve Been Neglectful Lord
You Know Where I’ve Been, And I Need To Feel Your Spirit Once Again.

Lord I Need To Feel Your Power And Joy In My Soul. And Sweet Peace That Comes When Jesus Has Control.
I Don’t Want To Walk This Road I Know Where It Ends. Would You Let Me Feel Your Spirit Once Again Please Let Me Feel Your Spirit Once Again.
