Invisible, yet tangible
Childlike and simple
Limitless, Heaven thinks like this
Oh, this is the kingdom realm
[Pre-Chorus]
Now I feel Heaven close
I can hear You calling
Come up here
The door's standing open
Come up here
Just let go of all the weight
When you're up here
There's no chaos or confusion
It is clear
So come up here
Higher thoughts, higher ways
Not by sight, only by faith
Your word it leads and Your spirit guides
Oh, I was born for this kingdom realm
