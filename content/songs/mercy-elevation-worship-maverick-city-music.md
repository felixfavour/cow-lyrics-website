I'm living proof
Of what the mercy of God can do
If you knew me then, you'd believe me now
He turned my whole life upside down
He took the old and He made it new
That's just what the mercy of God can do
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Now I'm alive to tell the story
How I've overcome
It's His goodness and mercy
And the power of His blood
I'm so glad that my freedom
Wasn't based on what I've done
But the goodness and mercy
And the power of the blood
So much power in the blood, oh, mm
I thought I deserved
Oh, to be six feet beneath the earth
For all the things I've done, the things I've said
The choices made that I regret
Oh, I would still be lost
Oh, but for the mercy of God
