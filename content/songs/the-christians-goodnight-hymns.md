Sleep on, beloved, sleep, and take thy rest;
Lay down thy head upon thy Saviour's breast;

We love thee well, but Jesus loves thee best
Good-night! Good-night! Good-night!

Calm is thy slumber as an infant's sleep;
But thou shalt wake no more to toil and weep:

Thine is a perfect rest, secure and deep
Good-night! Good-night! Good-night!

Until the shadows from this earth are cast,
Until He gathers in His sheaves at last,

Until the twilight gloom be over past
Good-night! Good-night! Good-night!

Until the Easter glory lights the skies,
Until the dead in Jesus shall arise,

And He shall come, but not in lowly guise
Good-night! Good-night! Good-night!

Until, made beau­ti­ful by love di­vine,
Thou, in the like­ness of thy Lord shalt shine,

And He shall bring that gold­en crown of thine
Good night! Good night! Good night!

Only Good night, be­lov­èd—not fare­well!
A lit­tle while, and all His saints shall dwell

In hal­lowed uni­son in­di­vi­si­ble
Good night! Good night! Good night!

Until we meet again be­fore His throne,
Clothed in the spot­less robe He gives His own,

Until we know ev­en as we are known
Good night! Good night! Good night!
