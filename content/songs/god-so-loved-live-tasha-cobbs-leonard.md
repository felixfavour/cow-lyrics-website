Come all you weary
Come all you thirsty
Come to the well
That never runs dry
Drink of the water
Come and thirst no more
Come all you sinners
Come find His mercy
Come to the table
He will satisfy
Taste of His goodness
Find what you're looking for
For God so loved
The world that He gave us
His one and only
Son to save us
Whoever believes in Him
Will live forever
Bring all your failures
Bring your addictions
Come lay them down
At the foot of the cross
Jesus is waiting there
With open arms
See His open arms
