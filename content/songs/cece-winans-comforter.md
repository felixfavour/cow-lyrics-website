Faithful Friend and Father, I've called You through the years
You've been Great Physician when sickness lingered near
Through distressing moments Your name is new and sweet
You've become Comforter to me
You are Comforter, that's who You are to me
Comforter, a name that fits so perfectly
Peace that passes all understanding
Comforter is who You are to me, it's who You are to me
And to the grieving family who weeps for loved ones gone
The pain of separation consumes another home
But on the waves of sorrow, You walk with perfect ease
Comforter is who the whole world needs
You are Comforter, that's who You are to me
Comforter, a name that fits so perfectly
Peace that passes all understanding
Comforter is who You are to me
Peace Giver, Life Changer
Joy River, Peace Giver
Way Maker, Life Changer
Peace Giver, Joy River
Comforter, that's who You are to me
Comforter, a name that fits so perfectly
Peace that passes all understanding
Comforter is who You are to me
Comforter is who You are to me
Peace Giver, Life Changer
Joy River, Peace Giver
Way Maker, Life Changer
Peace Giver, Joy River
Peace Giver, Life Changer
Joy River, Peace Giver
Way Maker, Life Changer
Peace Giver, Joy River
