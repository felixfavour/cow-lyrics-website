Why, my soul, are you downcast?
Why are you troubled within?
For I will hope in my Saviour, my God
And will praise Him, yet praise Him again
Why, my soul, are you downcast?
Why are you troubled within?
For I will hope in my Saviour, my God
And will praise Him, yet praise Him again
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
I will praise Him yet praise Him again
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
I will praise Him yet praise Him again
Morning by morning, new mercies are streaming
I trust in your goodness where I cannot see
You have been faithful whenever I wandered
Lord, give me the hope that I need
Morning by morning, new mercies are streaming
I trust in your goodness where I cannot see
You have been faithful whenever I wandered
Lord, give me the hope that I need
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
I will praise Him yet praise Him again
Why, my soul, are you downcast?
Why are you troubled within?
For I will hope in my Saviour, my God
And will praise Him, yet praise Him again
