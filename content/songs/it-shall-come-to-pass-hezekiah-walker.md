Every promise, every truth
Every word God has spoken to you;
It shall, it shall, come to pass, come to pass
Oh, it shall, it shall, come to pass
Every trial and heartbreak
These things, come to build your faith
It shall, it shall, come to pass, come to pass
Oh, it shall, it shall, come to pass
What God has spoken
He is more than able to do
The word God has begun in you
He shall, He shall perform it in you
It shall, it shall come to pass, come to pass
Oh it shall, it shall come to pass
(Oh hold on) Hold on
(And believe) and believe
(I know it will) It shall
(It's gonna come to pass) come to pass
(Hey, hold on) Hold on
(And believe) And believe
(I know it will) It shall
(It's gonna come to pass) come to pass
(Yes! Hold on) Hold on
(No matter what you're going through) And believe
(Hey! the bible says) Hold on
(Be not weary) And believe
(You don't have to worry, cause in due season) It shall
(It's gonna come to pass) Come to pass
(Yeah, hold on) Hold on
(He's working it all out) And believe
(I know it's gonna come to pass) It shall
(I know it will, I know it will) Come to pass
(Hey) Oh it shall
(I know it will) It shall
(It's gonna come to pass) Come to pass
(Yes it will, everything that He's spoken over you) Come to pass
(Oh Lord) Oh, it shall
