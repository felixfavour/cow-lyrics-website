A Sunday morning or a Friday night
If it's all wrong or if it's all alright
You can say whatever's on your mind
You don't even need to close your eyes
[Chorus: Russell Dickerson & Chris Tomlin]
Talk to Him, like a friend
Talk to Him, He's listening
Talk to Him, no matter how long it's been
Yeah, just go on
Talk to Him, don't be afraid
Talk to Him, it's never too late
Talk to Him, yeah, this is what it means to pray
Just talk to Him
When you're feeling like this life ain't fair
And you start wonderin' if He's even there, yeah
'Cause He took your daddy way too soon
The dreams you had, they all fell through
When it don't make no sense to you, yeah
All ya gotta do
[Chorus: Russell Dickerson & Chris Tomlin]
Is just talk to Him, like a friend
Talk to Him, He's listening
Talk to Him, no matter how long it's been
(No matter how long it's been)
Yeah, just go on
Talk to Him, don't be afraid
Talk to Him, it's never too late (It's never too late)
Talk to Him, yeah, this is what it means to pray
