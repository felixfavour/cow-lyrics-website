[Instrumental]
Where would I be
If it wasn't for Your kindness toward me?
You've been closer than a friend could ever be
There is nothing on the Earth that could take Your place
I am undone
For You see all there was and all that will be
Yet You've set Your vast affection upon me
By Your voice the world was made and still You called my name
Who can compare to You?
Who moves my heart the way You do
Who can compare to You?
Who moves my heart the way You do
I am undone
For You see all there was and all that will be
Yet You've set Your vast affection upon me
By Your voice the world was made and still You called my name
