What do you do when you've done all you can
And it seems like it's never enough?
And what do you say
When your friends turn away
And you all alone, alone?
Tell me, what do you give when you've given your all
And it seems like you can't make it through?
Well, you just stand when there's nothing left to do
You just stand, watch the Lord see you through
Yes, after you've done all you can,
You just stand
Tell me, how do you handle the guilt of your past?
Tell me, how do you deal with the shame?
And how can you smile while your heart has been broken
And filled with pain, filled with pain?
Tell me what do you give when you've given your all?
Seems like you can't make it through.
Child, you just stand when there's nothing left to do
You just stand, watch the Lord see you through
Yes, after you've done all you can,
You just stand
Stand and be sure
Be not entangled in that bondage again
You just stand and endure
God has a purpose,
Yes, god has a plan
Tell me what do you do when you've done all you can
And it seems like you can't make it through?
Child, you just stand, you just stand, stand
Don't you dare give up through the storm,
Stand through the rain
Through the hurt,
Yeah, through the pain
Don't you bow, and don't you bend
Don't give up, no, don't give in
Hold on,
Just be strong,
God will step in
And it won't be long
After you've done all you can, after you've done all you can
After you've gone through the hurt,
After you've gone through the pain
After you've gone through the storm,
After you've gone through the rain
Prayed and cried,
Prayed and cried
Prayed and cried
Prayed and cried, oh my
After you've done all you can you just stand
