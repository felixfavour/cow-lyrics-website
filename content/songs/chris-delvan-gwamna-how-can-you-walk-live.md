How can You walk when You don't know the way of the wind,
How can You run when You dont know the way of the spirit,
How can You fly when You don't know the way of the wind,
the power at work in You.
Bringing everything in obedience to Christ
How can You walk when You don't know the way of the wind
How can You run when You dont know the way of the spirit
How can You fly when You don't know the way of the wind
the power at work in You
Bringing everything in obedience to Christ
its bringing everything in obedience to Christ
swallow Your pride tonight come to the school of the spirit
don't You know in his hands is the keys to eternal life
a little here and a little there till the day will dawn
its at work in me
Bringing everything in obedience to christ
He is the Holy Ghost the spirit of the living God
he is the Holy Ghost the sceptre of the King of kings
he is the Holy Ghost the seal of the age to come
Bringing everything in obedience to Christ
