You were God from the outset
Powerful and creative
You who saw us here
Before You called all the stars
And the earth to existence
You are God You are holy
History is Your story
You who was and is
And who forever will be
God we live for Your glory
So we will run
All together our hearts aflame
With a fire that can't be tamed
Our God all glory to Your Name
Jesus
You are God You are freedom
You're alive now within us
You who saw us here before
You conquered the grave
And delivered on the promise
