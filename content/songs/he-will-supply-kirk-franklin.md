Though your vessel be empty
He will supply
For His yoke is easy
He will supply
He will supply
He will supply
OH Jesus said that He will supply
Though your dreams feel like memories
He will supply
And some relationships are now empty
He will supply
He will supply
He will supply
OH Jesus said that he will supply
So my friend don't you worry
He will supply
This is just temporary
He will supply
He will supply
He will supply
OH Jesus
OH Jesus
My Jesus
Sweet Jesus
Yes Jesus
OH Jesus said that He will supply
