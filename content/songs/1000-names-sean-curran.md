[Intro]
Sing 'em all back, sing 'em all back
Sing 'em all back, sing 'em all back
Sing 'em all back, sing 'em all back
I call You "maker"You give life an eternal spark
I call You "healer"You can mend any broken heart
I call You "faithful Father"You finish everything You start
My soul was made
To respond
I know You by a thousand names
And You deserve every single one
You've given me a million ways
To be amazed at what You've done
And I am lost in wonder
At all You do
I know You by a thousand names
And I'll sing them back to You, yeah
Sing 'em all back, sing 'em all back (Yeah, I'll sing 'em all back)
Sing 'em all back, sing 'em all back
