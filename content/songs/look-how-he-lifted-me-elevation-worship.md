My world was shaken
My heart was broken
My hope was fading
The walls were closing in
But now I'm singing
Look how He lifted me
My life was sinking
My days were numbered
The waves were crashing
The flood was coming in
Oh Hallelujah
Look how He lifted me
Look how He lifted me
His grace and mercy is my testimony
For every victory
I've got a song to sing
Look how He lifted me!
Whoa-o-oh
Whoa-o-o-oh
