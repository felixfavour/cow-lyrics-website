Brother Nwachukwu ListenI shine brightThe sun dey do ITEven my future sefThey wan blind meAnd when the people try to wan whine meI no dey fearJehovah don sign meI don't beg for breadI got the best bakerI'm so highI look down on sky scrapers He prepared the table before meIn the presence of my enemyWith like 19 waitersMy face dey showMy shoe dey shineAnybody wey no like amGo call Van Dam 2xI say Nobody go fit to stop my shine Nobody go fit to bring me downEven Nepa no go for cut my lightAnd many people don dey wonder whyWhy I dey shine shine shine Twinkle twinkle Little starMake you no dey wonderNa Baba Loke dey make me..My face dey showMy shoe dey shineAnybody wey no like amGo call Van Dam
