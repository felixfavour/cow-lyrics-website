Will You be my light, when I cannot see?
When I can't take another step, Lord, would You carry me?
When I've lost my fight, will You be my strength?
Will You set me a table in the presence of my enemies?

I shall not want, I shall not want
Oh my soul's got a shepherd in the valley and I shall not want
I shall not want, I shall not want
'Cause my cup's running over, running over and I shall not want
I will lift my eyes to where my help comes from
And I won't be afraid of the shadow 'cause I've seen the sun
No, I will not stop, when the way gets hard
'Cause the green only grows in the valley and that's where You are

(Say)
I shall not want (No, no) I shall not want (Hey!)
Oh my soul's got a shepherd in the valley and I shall not want (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I shall not want (Oh) I shall not want
('Cause my cup's running over)
'Cause my cup's running over, running over and I shall not want
