O come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him, born the King of angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
O come all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him
O come all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him
Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens of heav'n above
Glory to God, glory in the highest
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
O come all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him
O come all ye faithful
Come let us adore Him
O sing hallelujah
Come let us adore Him
O sing hallelujah
Come let us adore Him
