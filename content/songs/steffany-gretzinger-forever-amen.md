Let me hear the sound of your voice and I will leave it all behind.
Let me hear the sound of your voice and I'll come running
There's something in the sound of your voice that speaks to every part of me
When I hear the sound of your voice I'm alive.
I was made to love you
It's all I really know for sure
All I am is wrapped up in you
The center of my world
And I was made to love you
From my beginning to my end
And you'll be mine forever
Mine forever amen. (2x)
Amen, amen, amen, amen,amen
Amen,amen, amen, amen, amen (2x)
