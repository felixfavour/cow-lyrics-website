I am the Lord, your God
I go before you now
I stand beside you and I'm all around you
Though you feel I'm far away
I'm closer than your breath
And I am with you more than you know
[Interlude]
I am the Lord, your Peace
No evil will conquer you
So steady now your heart and mind
Come into My rest
And oh, let your faith arise
And lift up your weary head
I am with you wherever you go
Come to Me, I'm all you need
Come to Me, I'm everything
Come to Me, I'm all you need
Come to Me, I'm your everything
I am your anchor
In the wind and the waves
And I am your steadfast
So don't be afraid
Though your heart and flesh may fail you
I'm your faithful strength
And I am with you wherever you go
