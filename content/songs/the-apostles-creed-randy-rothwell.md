I believe in God, The Father Almighty
Maker of heaven and earth
And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit
Born of the Virgin Mary
Suffered under Pontius Pilate
Was crucified, dead, and buried
He descended into hell
The third day he rose again from the dead
He ascended into heaven
And sitteth on the right hand of God, the Father Almighty
From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead
I believe in the Holy Spirit
The Christian Church
The Communion of Saints
The Forgiveness of sins
The Resurrection of the body
And the Life everlasting
Amen
