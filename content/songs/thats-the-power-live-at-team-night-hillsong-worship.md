There's a name that levels mountains
Carves out highways through the sea
I've seen its power unravel battles
Right in front of me (Let's go church)
There's a faith that stands defiant
Sends Goliath to his knees
I've seen as praise unraveled shackles
Right off my feet
That's the power of Your name
Just a mention makes a way
Giants fall and strongholds break, and there is healing
That's the power that I claim
It's the same that rolled the grave
There's no power like the mighty name of Jesus (Yeah)
There's a hope that calls out courage
In the furnace unafraid
The kind of daring expectation
That every prayer I make (What?)
Is on an empty grave
That's the power of Your name
Just a mention makes a way
Giants fall and strongholds break, and there is healing
That's the power that I claim
It's the same that rolled the grave
There's no power like the mighty name of Jesus
There's no power like the mighty name of Jesus
