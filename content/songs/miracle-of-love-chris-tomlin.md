I got the news today
I heard that you were coming
It took my breath away
And the tears filled up my eyes
Surely you'd change some things
The way that I was living
I hit my knees to pray
So grateful for new life
A baby born, a baby born, a miracle of love
A gift from God sent to us from heaven above
And I thought I heard angels singing "Hallelujah"A baby born, a baby born, a miracle of love
Better than wonderful
Oh, isn't it amazing?
Something so small and frail
Can make me feel this way
I gotta tell everyone I know about this baby
It's getting close, and I can't wait for Christmas Day
A baby born, a baby born, a miracle of love
A gift from God sent to us from heaven above
And I thought I heard angels singing "Hallelujah"A baby born, a baby born, a miracle of love
