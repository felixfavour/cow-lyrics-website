I walked this road
So very long ago
To show the way
So you would know
I walked the road
With holes in my hands and feet
To make the way
Come follow me
Chorus:
Know you are not alone
You will be free indeed
The journey begins and ends
With me
One million miles
It starts with a step or two
What are you waiting for?
I'm waiting for you
You run the race
Thinking you've almost won
Then you may find
You've only begun
You're on the road
Thinking you're far from here
And suddenly find
You're very near
