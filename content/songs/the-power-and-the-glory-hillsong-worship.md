This grace is mine, this glory, earthbound heaven sent
This plan divine, this life this light that breaks my night
The Spirit of God, Heaven falls like a dove to my heart
This love is mine, so undeserved, this glorious name
This Son, this God, this life, this death, this victory won
Forgiveness has flowed as this grace
That is mine fills my heart
Chorus:
The power and the glory of Your name
The power and the glory of Your name
The power and the glory of Your name
The name of the Lord, the Son of God
This life is mine, so perfect and so pure, this God in me
This glorious hope from earth to heaven, death to life
This future assured and secured by this love in my heart
