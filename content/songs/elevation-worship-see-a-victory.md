The weapon may be formed but it won't prosper
In the darkness falls it won't prevail
Cause the God I serve only knows how to triumph
My God will never fail
My God will never fail
I'm gonna to see a victory
I'm going to see a victory
For the battle belongs to you lord
For the battle belongs to you lord
Ohhh  yeahh
