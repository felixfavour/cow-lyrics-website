The universe is at Your feet
Gives You praise evermore
The stars will light the sky for You
And always God be praised
[Pre-Chorus]
And we sing
The Lord is on high
The Lord is on high
I adore You
I adore You
And there's none that compares
To Your majesty oh Lord
I adore You
I adore You
And I stand
In the wonder of Your love
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus] 2x
