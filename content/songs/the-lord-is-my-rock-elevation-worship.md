When the waters rise
My hope is sure
When my world falls apart
I stand secure
When my way is dark
Your light breaks through
When i don't feel you near
Your word is true
Pre-Chorus:
Jesus your love surrounds me
You're holding my life
Holding my life
Chorus: (2x)
The Lord is my rock
And i won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
You're with me
When the waters rise
My hope is sure
When my world falls apart
I stand secure
