Faithful in the waiting You are
Always faithful in the valley You are
Faithful in the midst of hurt and pain
You are faithful
Your promises remain
Forever and ever
You won't fade away
You never, You never change
You're unchanging God
You will never change
You're unchanging God
Mighty in the battle You are
Always with me, You're the God who overcomes
Mighty You will raise me from the grave
You are mighty
Your promises remain
Forever and ever
You won't fade away
You never, You never change
You're unchanging God
You will never change
You're unchanging God
