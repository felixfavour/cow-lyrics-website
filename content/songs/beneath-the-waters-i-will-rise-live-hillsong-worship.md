This is my revelation, Christ Jesus crucified
Salvation through repentance, at the cross on which He died
Now here my absolution, forgiveness for my sin
And I sink beneath the waters, that Christ was buried in
I will rise, I will rise
As Christ was raised to life
Now in Him, now in Him
I live
I stand a new creation
, baptised in blood and fire
No fear of condemnation, by faith I'm justified
I will rise, I will rise
As Christ was raised to life
Now in Him, now in Him
I live
I will rise, I will rise
As Christ was raised to life
Now in Him, now in Him
I live
