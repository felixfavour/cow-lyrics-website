I am desperate for Your touch
A glimpse of heaven
For the glory of Your Son
In a moment You can
Turn a life around
Forever to be found in You
I am reaching out to find
Theres nothing greater than
Your love that holds my life
Your grace and mercy that
Have saved me by Your blood
And swept away my shame Oh Lord
Chorus
Your love is like fire
That burns for all to see
My only desire
To worship at Your feet
So let this fire
Consume my life
Let Your love take me deeper
Pull me closer to where You are
'cause all I want is more of You
And I'm surrender to Your love
Forever humbled by the
Message of the cross
I stand abandoned in
Your presence and Your embrace
And I'll never be the same Oh God
