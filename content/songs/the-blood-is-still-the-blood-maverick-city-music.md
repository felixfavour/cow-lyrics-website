I was a leper outside the city
None would come close
But You wouldnâ€™t let go
What worked back then
Will work again
I know the blood is still the blood
And I had an issue
No one could help
I tried them all
My last try I crawled
And what worked back then
Will work again
I know the blood is still the blood
[Chorus: Chandler Moore]
Let's sing
And oh, how precious
How beautiful
This priceless love
I've come to know
And in the midst of
My darkest storm
I know the blood is still the blood
It is, it is
