In his time, in his time
He makes all things beautiful
In his time
Lord please show me everyday
As you're teaching me your way
That you do just what you say
In your time
In your time, in your time
You make all things beautiful
In your time
Lord my life to you I bring
May each song I have to sing
Be to you a lovely thing
In your time
(instrumental)
Lord please show me everyday
As you teaching me your way
That you do just what you say
In your time
In your time (in your time), in your time (in your time lord)
You make all things beautiful
In your time
