[Intro]
Let our worship rise tonight, God
We'll pour our love on You
Break open our [?]
Give You everything
From here to there
Worship is filling the atmosphere
Both now and then
Songs of Your love will never end
All day and night
As we bow down our praise will rise
Inside and out
All that I am will shout
Let my worship rise
Like a sweet perfume
I'll pour my love, my love
All over You
From here to there
Worship is filling the atmosphere
Both now and then
Songs of Your love will never end
