I believe the word of God
Even more than what I see around
I move by faith and not by sight
Believing what you said
Deep down in my heart there’s a testimony
Filled with the hope of eternity
I Walk by faith and not by sight
Believing what you said
[Bridge:]
My victory is in the promise of eternity
No longer bound by what I see
I have the victory
[Chorus:]
Through Christ we triumph
Through Christ We have the victory
[Vamp:]
My victory is guaranteed
And not based on the things that I see around me
His proclamation is my destination
What he says, I’ll say
I’ll see what he says
