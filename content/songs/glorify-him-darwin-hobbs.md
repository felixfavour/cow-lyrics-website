[Chorus:]
Glorify the Lord
Glorify the Lord
Glorify the Lord
Make His praise glorious
Glorify the Lord
Glorify the Lord
Glorify the Lord
Make His praise glorious
Glorious!
From every mountain
To every valley low
Open your fountain
And let the praises flow
Sing Hallelujah
Come on and make His praise
Glorious!
Glorious!
From every nation
To every city street
All of creation
Worship His majesty
Sing Hallelujah
Come on and make his praise
Glorious!
