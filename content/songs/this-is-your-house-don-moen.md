[Intro]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Oh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
As we gather in this place today
Holy Spirit come and have Your way
Have Your way
As we lay aside our own desires
Sweep across our hearts with holy fire
Oh, have Your way
This is Your house, Your home
We welcome You, Lord, we welcome You
This is Your house, Your home
We welcome You today
As we offer up our hearts and lives
Let them be a living sacrifice
Oh, have Your way
Be glorified in everything we do
Be glorified in everything we say
Have Your way
