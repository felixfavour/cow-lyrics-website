1: Our Lord, we Thy children have
come
To bring all our request before Thee,
Just as you have heard the prayers of
Elijah,
Hearken unto our prayers.

2: Thus he prayed that the rain might
not fall,
For complete three years and six
months,
Just as you have heard the prayers of
Elijah,
Hearken unto our prayers.
3: He offered prayers a second time,
There was rain and the soil brought
forth fruits,
Just as you have heard the prayers of
Elijah,
Hearken unto our prayers.

4: Prayers opened the door of mercy,
Prayer also opened Hannahâ€™s womb,
Just as you have heard the prayers of
Elijah,
Hearken unto our prayers. 
Amen
