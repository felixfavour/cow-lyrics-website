You know I've had some lonely days
I've made mistakes and had to pay
I've had some friends that walked away
Just like mama told me
But there's someone who's love is real
Who cares about the way I feel (I know you feel)
Every pain that erased every stain
There's peace when I call out your name
Jesus your my everything
The cross you did that just for me
So whatever you take me through
I promise you
I'll spend my always with you
Can you lift your hands and help me worship
Our father he's not dead he's arisen listen
No one can touch my heart like you
Or make me smile the way you do
I finally found someone who
Who really truly loves me
But when my strength has come and gone
Your life in me it makes me strong
Your hand is where my heart belongs
You took all my pain
And erased every stain
