Exodus begins with a triumphant story of a man
Chapter 2, verse 1, listen closely, you'll understand the plan
Pharaoh, in the heat of his anger, plotted to destroy
The babies from Israel's belly, let the girls live but kill every boy
But a child named Moses was one that God chose to be
The vessel sent into Egypt to deliver Israel and set the captives free, ya see
God took a nobody, made him a somebody
Told Pharaoh (What'd he tell him?) to let my people go
(No matter what you do to me)
(No matter what you say to me)
(No matter what you think of me) What you gonna say?
(Let my people go)
(No matter what you do to me) That's right
(No matter what you say to me) That's right
(No matter what you think of me)
(Let my people go)
It's 1999, and unfortunately we still ain't free, ya see
Ya think racism is a ghost like Casper
Look what just happened down in Jasper
I ask you why the babies dying and daddies crying
From the east side to the west side
To the south side, genocide
You can't hide from the fact
All the modern day Pharaohs I attack
And I stack
The knowledge inside my mind
Packs heat like a nine
The power from above I find
Rise up, my people, 'cause it's time
Come on, come on
