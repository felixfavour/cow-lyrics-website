[Intro]
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
I am Yours and You are mine
I am ravished by the sight
Of one glimpse into Your eyes
My Lover's coming for His bride
For there is none upon the earth
That I desire before You, Lord
For You've been faithful all my days
Your love endures, it will never fade away
[Pre-Chorus]
I need to say what my soul is singing
I need to say what my heart is screaming
I need to say what my soul is singing
I need to say what my heart is screaming
That I love You, my Dear
I love You, my Dear, my Dear
That I love You, my Dear
That I love You, my Dear, my Dear
