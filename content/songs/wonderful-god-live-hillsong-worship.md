Beautiful is Your creation
You're glorious in every way
You surround us with Your faithful love
And we can trust in all You say
Wonderful God, wonderful, O God
You are worthy of all glory, all honor and praise
All to You our God, forever and always
You are worthy of our worship and worthy of our love
We stand in awe of all You are
You are love, You are life, You are all glorious
You are love, You are life, You are all glorious
