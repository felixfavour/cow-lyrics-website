You are my maker
You knit me in my mother's womb
You are my helper
When I call I know you won't chase me away

You are my keeper
Through it all, I know that I will prevail
You are my armour
So my protection is guaranteed

You are everything
We need everything we need you alone will do

We will go in your strength
In your strength, we will go
We will flourish until the moon
The moon is no more

You are my healer
So healing will spring forth speedily
You are my father
No good thing you will withhold from me
Youâ€™re my deliver
Every yoke of bondage is destroyed

We will go in your strength
In your strength, we will go
We will flourish until the moon
The moon the moon is no more

Hallelujah, we will go
Hallelujah, we will go

We will go in your strength
In your strength, we will go
We will flourish until the moon
The moon the moon is no more
