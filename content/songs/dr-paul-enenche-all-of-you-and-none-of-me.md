1/3 May my hearth become your throne dear lord
May you find your rest in me
May nothing contend for me with you
May you be the lord of all
CHORUS
All of you and none of me
Is what my heart cares for lord
May I decrease that you may increase?
May   you be the lord of all.
2/3     May my voice become your voice dear lord
Find your expression through me
I struggle not be seen or heard
Lord be seen and heard through me
3/3      I surrender my all to you lord
Do with me lord as you please
I lay down my plans and ambitions
Not my will but yours be done
