[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
For those of you that think gospel music has gone too far
You think we got too radical with our message
Well I got news for you , you ain't heard nothin yet
And if you don't know now you know. Glory, Glory!!
Lately I've been going through some things that really got me down
I need someone somebody to help me come and turn my life around
I can't explain, I can't obtain it. Jesus your love is so, it's so amazing
It gets me high up to the sky, and when I think about your goodness it makes me wanna stomp
Makes me clap my hands. Makes me wanna dance and stomp
My brother can't you see I got the victory. STOMP!!!
