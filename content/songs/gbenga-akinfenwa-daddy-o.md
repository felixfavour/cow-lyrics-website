Da-ddy oh Da-ddy oh
See your child that you have helped
Da-ddy I have see-en your hands
In my life gboin gboin
Da-ddy oh ooh Da-ddy oo
Daddy what can I give to you
I will lift my ha-ands to you
I will sing for Joy
See the hands of the ones you have helped
See the face of the ones who have seen your grace
I could never have done all these on my own
If not by your help o lord (Eh eh)
And when people ask me say
Na how you dey do am oo
I just lift my hands up and I testify
Na Jesus dey do am oo
(Oh daddy oo)
