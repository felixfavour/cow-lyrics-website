Freely, freely
you gave me internal life
that's all indestructable
freely, freely
you gave me your righteousness
to live for you in liberty 2
if I could afford to pay for everything you gave to me
it's still be with all the wealth you gave me freely
if I were to estimate or quantify the value of your love
it's still be with all the wisdom you gave me
father of love you truly are
you made the sun shine on all creation
father your love is unreserved
freely you blessed me beyond imagination 2
freely freely you gave me your legal license to stand before your presence
freely freely you gave me the holy spirit that's how I come and know about the things you gave to me
that's how I know how to harness every gift you've given to me
if I could afford to pay for everything you gave to me it's still be with all the wealth you gave me freely
if I were to estimate or quantify the value of your love it's still be with all the wisdom you gave me
father of love you truly are
you made the sun shine on all creation
father your love is unreserved
freely you blessed me beyond imagination 2
(freely you blessed me beyond imagination)
(before I was born you already gave me everything)
if I could afford to pay for everything you gave to me it's still be with all the wealth you gave me freely
f I were to estimate or quantify the value of your love it's still be with all the wisdom you gave me
father of love you truly are
you made the sun shine on all creation
father your love is unreserved
freely you blessed me beyond imagination 2
freely
