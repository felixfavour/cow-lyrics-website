Dear God
I've been trying awful hard to make You proud of me
But it seems
The harder that I try or the harder it becomes
And I feel like giving up
Most of the time (Time)
Dear God
I've been chasing their approval and it's killin' me
And I know
The more I to try to prove the less I have to show
And I'm stuck inside my head
Most of the time
[Pre-Chorus]
But If I pray a little harder
If I follow all the rules
I wonder could I ever be enough
'Cause I try and try (Try and try)
Just to fall back down again
And I ask myself why (Ask, why)
Do I try to chase the wind?
I should lean into thе mystery
Maybe hope is found in a mеlody
So I wanna try again
Oh, I’m gonna try again
