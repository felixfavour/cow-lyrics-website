[Intro: 
Common
]
These are tough times we live in, but still we can't just give in
We must stand tall and live strong, it's up to the youth to live on
And carry this torch we pass down
You see, I know it's not the last round
In the next generation, my faith is unwavering
My confidence in you is unshakeable
Because I know that you're willing and far beyond capable
Of doing all that must be done
But to do it all, we must be as one
Life can be better than most of us dream
 (Yeah)
So once you take the reins
Believe in your greatness which lies within
And for the better, this world will change
I see that you want it (Want it), I see that you're working for it
So don't take no days off, it's gonna pay off
I see that you love it (Love it), I want you to know that
Before you can see it, you gotta believe it
You're the generation of tomorrow
The pursuit starts today
And all time is borrowed (Mmm, mmm)
So you have none to waste
[Pre-Chorus]
You are not (You are not), oh, I repeat
You are not put on this Earth to lose (Lose, nah)
And you are hot (You are hot), yeah, I repeat it
That you are hot, so do what you do
