Life is easy, when you're up on the mountain. And you've got peace of mind, like you've never known; but then things change and, your down in the valley. Don't lose faith child, you are never alone. 

For the God on the mountain, is still God in the valley. When things go wrong, He'll make them right; and the God of the good times, is still God in the bad times. The God of the day is still God in the night. 

You talk of faith when, you're up on the mountain. But the talk comes easy, when life's at its best. It's down in the valley, of trials and temptations. That's when faith is, really put to the test. 

For the God on the mountain, is still God in the valley. When things go wrong, He'll make them right; and the God of the good times, is still God in the bad times. The God of the day is still God in the night. 

The God of the day, is still God in the night.
