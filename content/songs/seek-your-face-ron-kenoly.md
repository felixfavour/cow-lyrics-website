Lord I long to seek Your face
I've come into this holy place
To worship
To worship You
(Repeat)
A place where Your glory
Surrounds me
And I become brand new
A place where Your presence
Brings reverence
I desire to be with You
(Repeat chorus 2 times)
(Repeat verse)
When I'm with You
I am complete
My world stops turning
When You're holding me
Lord my desire
Is to be in Your presence
So I'm running to You
For another touch of Heaven
(Repeat chorus)
