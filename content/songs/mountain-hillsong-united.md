See a light in the darkness
A city shining without a veil
This hill becoming a mountain
A solid rock that will never fail
Your name, my hope
Fortress in the raging storm
My heart is Your home
Jesus let Your love take hold
The stone the builders rejected
Laid to ransom a fractured bride
Our crushing weight on Your shoulders
You stand forever with arms stretched wide
Your name, my hope
Fortress in the raging storm
My heart is Your home
Jesus let Your love take hold
Your name, my hope
Fortress in the raging storm
My heart is Your home
Jesus let Your love take hold!
