[Intro]
Yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Danger, giants
Battle is my story
But alone, I won't know
That's my glory
Shadows, you cannot hide me, uh
My King will fight
The God of angel armies
Is always by my side (Side, side, side, side, side, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got a, got a, got a army
Got a, got a, I got a army
Tell me, who gon' come for me?
Greater is the One who you can't see, bring the war, I got a
Got a, got a, got a army
I got a, uh, I got a, uh, I got a army
Who run it? (Who run it?) Who running? (Who running?) Almighty (Almighty), who want it? (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) Yeah
Life ain't been the same since death died
Won it by a landslide
Uh, hallelujah to the flex my, my
The power made a point, next slide
Yeah, yeah, yeah, reppin' this side
Shoes ain't Gucci, I just keep my foot on reptiles (Steppin' on a snake)
Coming for my neck now (Coming for me)
When the game about to end, you expect fouls (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh vanity, Satan try to cancel me
I don't fear your plan for me
I just made a canopy
When you come to handle me
There's another hand on me
Even when they all abandon me
God got the destiny, I see no enemy, yeah
