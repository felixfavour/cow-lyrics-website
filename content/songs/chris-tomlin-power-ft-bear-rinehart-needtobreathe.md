Some may trust in horses
Some may trust in chariots
Woah, but I, I'm gon' trust in the name of the Lord
Some trust in their riches
Some may trust in all they own
Oh, but I, I will trust in the name of the Lord
There is wonder working power
Holy Spirit power
Great redeeming power
Power in the name
Resurrection power
Bondage breaking power
Power in the name of Jesus
Some trust in their wisdom
Some, they say it's foolishness
Woah, but I (oh, but I), I will trust in the name of the Lord
There is wonder working power
Holy Spirit power
Great redeeming power
Power in the name
Resurrection power
Bondage breaking power
Power in the name of Jesus
I lift my eyes to the mountains, the mountains above
You are, You are where my help is from
I lift my eyes to the maker of Heaven and Earth
You are, You are where my help is from
There is wonder working power
Holy Spirit power
Great redeeming power
Power in the name
Resurrection power
Bondage breaking power
Power in His name, there's power in His name
There is wonder working power
Holy Spirit power
Great redeeming power
Power in the name
Resurrection power
Bondage breaking power
Power in the name of Jesus
I lift my eyes to the mountains, the mountains above
You are, You are where my help is from
