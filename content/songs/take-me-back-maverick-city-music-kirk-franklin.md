[Chorus: Dante Bowe & 
Maverick City Choir
]
When the storm's out on the ocean
And the violent wind gets to blowing
Oh, take me back, back
All the way back
Oh, take me back to my first love
Sing it again, "When the storm's out," hey
When the storm's out on the ocean
And the violent wind gets to blowing
Oh, You're faithful to take me back, back
All the way back
Oh, take me back (Say, "Back"), back
(All the way) All the way back
(Oh) Oh, take me back, back
All the way back
Oh, take me back to my first love (My first love)
You are real to me
I have known it from thе start (Oh)
And there's no in-between (No in-bеtween)
The heavens and my heart, yeah
And You are near to me
I've never been too far, hey
I can't outrun Your grace, I can't outrun Your grace
And in the in-between
You brought Heaven to my heart, yeah
