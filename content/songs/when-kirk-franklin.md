Raindrops make sounds, the earthquakes and moans they
Both sing how long till the wedding day
Stars robed in white
Decorate the sky
While the fragile bride cries, "take me away"Who can explain
These storms and these waves that
Echo birth planes please hear what they say
Mountains and trees every living thing
Shouts hurry back please and do not delay
[Chorus:]
When will You come for Your daughters and sons
We are homesick we try, but we don't belong
Even if that day's a million light years away
Each day will begin with the same question:
When, when, when, when?
Creation speaks the winds through the leaves
It begs to be free no curses remain
Famine, disease Your people are weak
Help us to believe it could be any day
