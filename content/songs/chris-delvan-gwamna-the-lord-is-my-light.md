The Lord is my light
And the light of my Life
I shall not be afraid 2ce
I've got His Spirit in my heart
And His word upon my lips
Why should I be afraid? 2ce
Because His arms that lifted me
They will uphold me to the end
oh oh oh
I shall not be afraid 2ce
The Lord is my light...
The Lord is my light
And the light of my Life
I shall not be afraid 2ce
So when the morning fails
And the night seems to prevail
I shall not be afraid 2ce
Let me tell you why...
'Cos I called upon His name
Long before my troubles came
And that is why
I shall not be afraid 2ce
The Lord is my light...
The Lord is my light
And the light of my Life
I shall not be afraid 2ce
I'm not afraid of a man
Cos His breath is in God's hands
Here I stand upon the solid ground
I won't bow to your command
I defy your every threat
The Word of God is my security...
The Lord is my light...
The Lord is my light
And the light of my life
I shall not be afraid
For the roar of the Lion is in my midst. yeah!
Why should I be afraid?
So when the dogs surround me to eat my flesh
I shall not be afraid
When the seige is laid around my city
Why should I be afraid?
For the darkness be like the darkest night
I shall not be afraid
Cos the roar of the King in the midst of all His people
Why should I be afraid
