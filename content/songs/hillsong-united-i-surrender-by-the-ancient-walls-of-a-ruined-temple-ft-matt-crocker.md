Here I am
down on my knees again
surrendering all, surrendering all
Find me here, Lord as you draw me near
I'm desperate for you, I'm desperate for you.
I surrender oo
Drench my soul
as mercy and grace unfold
I hunger and thirst, I hunger and thirst
With arms stretched wide
I know you hear cry
Speak to me now, speak to me
I surrender
I wanna know you more, I wanna know you more. (x2)
Like a rushing wind
Jesus breathe within
Lord have your way, Lord have your way,
in me.
Like a mighty storm
stirred within my soul
Lord have your way, Lord have your way
in me. (x3)
Lord have your way, Lord have your way.
in me.
I surrender, I surrender
I wanna know you more, I wanna know you more. (x2)
