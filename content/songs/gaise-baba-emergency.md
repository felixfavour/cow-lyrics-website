Thinking nobody go know

With a side piece o
Pretty, with hips to kill o
Like say nothing fit sweet pass am...
Má kbá mi o (Don't implicate me)
Biko, I no fit o (Please, I can't)
If I fall for this o
Wahala go dey (There'll be trouble)
Even if not immediately o
Or suddenly o
But eventually o
Ã ma di gÃ²be (There'll be consequences)
This is an EMERGENCY
Mo b'ésÃ¨ mi s'Ã²rÃ² speedily (I flee speedily)
I'll be foolish to think I can handle it
Blood dey my body o
Eh! This is an EMERGENCY
O je b'ésÃ¨ re s'Ã²rÃ² accordingly (Be wise enough to flee)
No go dey think you can handle it
IÅan l pa Bruce Lee o (Stubbornness kills)
V2:
David fought many battles in his life
But none of them was in his own house
Then he go carry who no be him wife
All of a sudden, small small o...
Family scatter;

Absalom kill Amnon, kill him brother run away
Then he return dey drag throne with daddy
Wage war with daddy
Chaos for family...
Chorus:
This is an EMERGENCY
Mo b'ésÃ¨ mi s'Ã²rÃ² speedily (I flee speedily)

Eh! This is an EMERGENCY
O je b'ésÃ¨ re s'Ã²rÃ² accordingly (Be wise enough to flee)
No go dey think you can handle it
IÅan l pa Bruce Lee o (Stubbornness kills)
