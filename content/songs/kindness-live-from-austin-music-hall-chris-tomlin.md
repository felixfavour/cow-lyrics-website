Open up the skies of mercy
And rain down the cleansing flood
Healing waters rise around us
And hear our cries, Lord and let 'em rise
Open up the skies of mercy
And rain down the cleansing flood
Healing waters rise around us
And hear our cries, Lord and let 'em rise
And it's Your kindness, Lord
That leads us to repentance
Your favor, Lord, is our desire
And it's Your beauty, Lord
That makes us stand in silence
And Your love, Your love is better than life
We can feel Your mercy fallin'
You are turnin' our hearts back again
Hear our praises, rise to Heaven
And draw us near, Lord, and meet us here
And it's Your kindness, Lord
That leads us to repentance
Your favor, Lord, is our desire
And it's Your beauty, Lord
That makes us stand in silence
And Your love, Your love
And it's Your kindness, Lord
That leads us to repentance
Your favor, Lord, is our desire
And it's Your beauty, Lord
That makes us stand in silence
And Your love, Your love, is better than life
It's better than life, it's Your love
Open up the skies of mercy
And rain down the cleansing flood
Healing waters rise around us
And hear our cries, Lord, let 'em rise
