Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay, You set me on a rock
You called me by Your name
And made my heart whole again
Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
That I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
(
So come on then
)
You pulled me from the clay, You set me on a rock
You called me by Your name
And made my heart whole again
So here I stand, high in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart, now and forever
My soul cries out
Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now
