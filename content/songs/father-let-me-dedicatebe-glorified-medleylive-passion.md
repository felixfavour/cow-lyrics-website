Father let me dedicate all this life to Thee
In whatever worldly state Thou would have me be
Not from sorrow, pain or care, freedom dare I claim
This alone shall be my prayer, glorify Thy name
Be glorified in me, be glorified
Be glorified in me, be glorified
Can a child presume to choose where or how to live?
Can a Father's love refuse all the best to give?
Let my glad heart, while it sings, There in all proclaim
And, whate'er the future brings, glorify Thy Name
Be glorified in me, be glorified in me
Be glorified in me, be glorified
Be glorified in me, be glorified
Yes, Lord - spoken
Be glorified in me, be glorified, oh
Spoken:
King of glory, have Your glory
King of glory, have Your glory
Not from sorrow, pain or care, freedom dare I claim
This alone shall be my prayer, glorify Thy name
