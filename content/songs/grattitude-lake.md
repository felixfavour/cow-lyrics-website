All my words fall short
I got nothing new
how could I express 
all my gratitude

I could sing these songs
as I often do
But ev'ry song must end
and You never do

So I throw up my hands and praise 
You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a 
hallelujah, hallelujah

and I know it's not much,
but I've nothing else fit for a King
except for a heart singing 
hallelujah, hallelujah

I've got one response, 
I've got just one move
With my arms stretched wide
I will worship You

So I throw up my hands and praise 
You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a 
hallelujah, hallelujah

and I know it's not much,
but I've nothing else fit for a King
except for a heart singing 
hallelujah, hallelujah

Come on my soul, oh, 
don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song, 'cause you got a lion
inside of those lungs
Get up and praise the Lord  

Come on my soul, oh, 
don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song, 'cause you got a lion
inside of those lungs
Get up and praise the Lord  

So I throw up my hands and praise 
You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a 
hallelujah, hallelujah

and I know it's not much,
but I've nothing else fit for a King
except for a heart singing 
hallelujah, hallelujah
