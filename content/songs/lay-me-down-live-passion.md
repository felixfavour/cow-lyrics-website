With this heart open wide
From the depths, from the heights
I will bring a sacrifice
With these hands lifted high
Hear my song, hear my cry
I will bring a sacrifice
I will bring a sacrifice
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin]
I lay me down, I'm not my own
I belong to You alone
Lay me down, lay me down
Oh, hand on my heart
This much is true
There's no life apart from You
Lay me down, lay me down
Letting go of my pride
Giving up all my rights
Take this life and let it shine, shine, shine
Take this life and let it shine
[Chorus: Both]
I lay me down, I'm not my own
I belong to You alone
Lay me down, lay me down
Oh, hand on my heart
This much is true
There's no life apart from You
Lay me down, lay me down
Oh, lay me down, lay me down
