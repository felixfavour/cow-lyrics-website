[Chorus]
Though Christ was dead
Now surely He's risen
Yeah, He's coming back again
And Christ will reign
In triumph forever
Yeah, all praise belongs to Him
Yeah, all praise belongs to Jesus
The gospel of Jesus
It's the hope of the ages
Burning brighter and brighter
And standing forever
The church He is building
Nothing can stop it
It's a city that's shining
A light in the darkness
(Oh, come on!)
Nothing can stop it
Though Christ was dead
Now surely He's risen
Yeah, He's coming back again
And Christ will reign
In triumph forever
Yeah, all praise belongs to Him
Yeah, all praise belongs to Jesus
