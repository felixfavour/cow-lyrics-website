Let our worship rise to You Jesus
Let the fragrance please Your heart
Pure in spirit and in truth Jesus
Hear our passion hear our cry
Hallelujah Your name be praised in all the earth
Hallelujah let every voice declare Your worth
Shout to the King of Glory
Jesus worthy so worthy You are
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Humbly we approach Your throne Jesus
To behold Your holiness
Set apart and called Your own Jesus
Hear our passion hear our cry
[Bridge]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Amen
