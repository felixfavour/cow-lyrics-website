Glory
Glory to God
In the highest
Glory
Glory to God
When nothing else could help
You came and rescued me
Your love lifted me
Your love lifted me
Your love lifted me
I am free to sing of Your love
[Post-Chorus]
Hallelujah
It's Your love
It's Your love
Yeah
(Glory)
 Glory
Glory to God
(In the highest)
 In the highest
(Glory)
 Glory
(Glory)
 Glory to God
(When nothing else)
 When nothing else could help
(You came and rescued)
 You came and rescued me
