Jesus, Lamb of God!

God of creation
All things were made through Jesus
Born of a virgin
Promise fulfilled in Jesus
Suffering Servant
Oh, the blood of Jesus!
Resurrection and Life
Death has died in Jesus
Word of the Father
Yahweh revealed in Jesus

The Kingdom belongs to Jesus
Lion and Lamb
We overcome by Jesus
