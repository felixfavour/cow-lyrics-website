VERSE
You lay aside Your throne
And to this world
You have come
You offered up Your life
The debt You paid
Was not Yours
CHORUS
Your grace abounds to me
Your grace abounds to me
Jesus
In You I find all that I need
VERSE
A gift I could not earn
Your open arms
Are undeserved
Enabled by Your grace
Now to live
Is Christ alone
BRIDGE
All powerful
All glorious
There's nothing like the Name of Jesus
