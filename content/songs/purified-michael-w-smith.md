Where the angels see
You are praised as You should be
But how can I express
My yearning for Your holiness
May it be; that...
I will open up my heart
Search me in the deepest part
And I will stand in cleansing fire
By You, purified
By You, I'm purified
Savior of my soul
To Your strength I yield control
Purge me of my stain
Sin will lose it's mortal reign
Make me free; and...
I will open up my heart
Search me in the deepest part
And I will stand in cleansing fire
By You, purified
By You, I'm purified
