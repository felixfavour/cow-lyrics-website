V1
We   will   not   be   silent
We   will   not   be   forced   to   back   away
We   will   not   be   quiet
We   love   you,   we   love   you
We   will   not   be   shaken
No   one   can   intimidate   our   praise
We   are   not   forsaken
You   love   us,   you   love   us   all
Pre Chorus
With   an   everlasting   love
You   are   pouring   over   us
We   respond   with   adoration
Chorus
Higher,   Higher
Jesus   you   will   be
Forever   lifted   up,   forever   lifted   up
Weâ€™re   gonna   make   it
Louder,   Louder,   Jesus
We   will   sing   and   shout   about   your   love
We   will   shout   about   your   love
