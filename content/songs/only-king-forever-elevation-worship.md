Our God, a firm foundation
Our rock, the only solid ground
As nations rise and fall
Kingdoms once strong now shaken
But we trust forever in Your name
The name of Jesus
We trust the name of Jesus
You are the only King forever
Almighty God we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, You are victorious
You are the only King forever
Almighty God we lift You higher
You are the only King forever
Forevermore, You are victorious
Unmatched in all Your wisdom
In love and justice You will reign
And every knee will bow
We bring our expectations
Our hope is anchored in Your name
The name of Jesus
We trust the name of Jesus
