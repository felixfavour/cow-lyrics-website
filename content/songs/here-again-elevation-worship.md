Can't go back to the beginning
Can't control what tomorrow will bring
But I know here in the middle
Is the place where You promise to be
I'm not enough unless You come
Will You meet me here again
'Cause all I want is all You are
Will You meet me here again
As I walk now through the valley
Let Your love rise above every fear
Like the sun shaping the shadow
In my weakness Your glory appears
I'm not enough unless You come
Will You meet me here again
'Cause all I want is all You are
Will You meet me here again
I'm not enough unless You come
Will You meet me here again
'Cause all I want is all You are
Will You meet me here again
