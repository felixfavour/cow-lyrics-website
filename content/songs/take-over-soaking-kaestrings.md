Lord,here I am before your throne
I lay me down,refine my soul
Till all is saved,it is you o lord
                                                              Chorus:
Lord,I surrender, do a work in me
Purify my motives till you are all they see x2
Ooooooooh x2
Consume my heart and  make it yours
Cause I lay me down,refine my soul
Till all is saved,it is you o lord
Back to chorus x1
Come do a work in me
Purify my motives,till you are all they see
Do a work in me x3
End!
