Clap, clap, let's go, come on

Everybody shout with me (Yes Lord I believe)
Everybody shout with me (Yes Lord I agree)
Shout it out if you agree (Yes Lord I believe)
All things are possible, all things
All things are possible, all things

God cannot fail (He can't)
He cannot fail (God cannot fail)
God cannot fail (come on)
He cannot fail


Now everybody clap, let's go
Somebody make some noise in the building, we goin' up
The bible says; how can two work except they agree
So can you give your neighbour a high five and say I agree

I agree, I agree, I agree
I agree, I agree, I agree
I agree, I agree, I agree
I agree, I agree, I agree

I agree, I agree, I agree (He cannot)
He cannot fail
I agree, I agree, I agree (He cannot)
He cannot fail
I agree, I agree, I agree (God cannot)
He cannot Fail
I agree, I agree, I agree
He cannot fail
He cannot fail (He cannot fail)

Everybody shout it out (He cannot fail)
God will watch over Him (He cannot fail)
Who shall perform it (He cannot fail)
He's not a man that He should lie (He cannot fail)
Who's not a man that He should lie (He cannot fail)
Not a son that He should repent (He cannot fail)
Not a son that He should repent (He cannot fail)
God cannot (He cannot fail)
God cannot (He cannot fail)
Say, God cannot (He cannot fail)
God (He cannot fail)
Say, God made me a promise (He cannot fail)
Faithful, I know I'll receive (He cannot fail)
I stand on the word of God (He cannot fail)
Yeah! (He cannot fail)
He's faithful to a fault, yeah (He cannot fail)
Say, I'm the head, not the tail (He cannot fail)
He cannot be defeated (He cannot fail)
And I'm the righteous He's supporting (He cannot fail)
And I... (He cannot fail)
He's too big to fail you (He cannot fail)
He's too strong to disappoint (He cannot fail)
And ah-ah-ah-ah-ah (He cannot fail)

I need y'all to put your hands on it like it's sunday morning
God cannot fail
God cannot fail (He cannot fail)
Say it though (He cannot fail)
Everybody say, if you believe let me hear you say (He cannot fail)
Speak it over your family and say (He cannot fail)
Speak the word of God (He cannot fail)
He asked you to see, if you feel it (He cannot fail)
Well I know I can feel it (He cannot fail)
We hold on with God (He cannot fail)
Yeah, I know (He cannot fail)
He's working His way into your home (He cannot fail)
He thrives, don't know what it means to fail (He cannot fail)
God cannot fail (He cannot fail)

Open up your mouth if you believe that God cannot fail
Open up your mouth, receive

Everybody shout with me (Yes Lord I believe)
Everybody shout with me (Yes Lord I agree)
Shout it out if you agree (Yes Lord I believe)
All things are possible, all things (Speak it over yourself)
All things are possible, all things (Speak it over your money, say it)
All things are possible, all things (Speak it over your neighbours, say it)
All things are possible, all things (Let me hear y'all say it)
All things are possible, all things (Say it 'til it weighs down in your spirit)
All things are possible, all things (Say it until it breaks into you)
All things are possible, all things (Anybody believin' in God for anythin', say it)
All things are possible, all things (Just one more time, say it)
All things are possible, all things

Sometimes, you've just got to remind yourself
Everybody shout with me (yes Lord I believe)
Shout it out if you agree (yes Lord I agree)
Everybody shout with me yeah (yes Lord I believe)
All things are possible, all things (last time, everbody say it)
All things are possible, all things
