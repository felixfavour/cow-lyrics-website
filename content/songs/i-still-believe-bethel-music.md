I choose to sing when I can hardly breathe out a breath
I choose to stand when all I wanted to is give up
I choose to trust when my whole world is fallin' apart
I choose You, Jesus
'Cause I still believe through it all
I still believe You are wonderful, and
You've never given up on me
You've never given up on me
I choose to love when everything around me screams hate
I choose to hеal when I have walked through sorrow and pain
I choosе Your name, the only name that's worthy of praise
I choose You, Jesus
'Cause I still believe through it all
I still believe You are wonderful
You've never given up on me
'Cause I still believe You are powerful
I still believe You do miracles
You've never given up on me
You've never given up on me, yeah
You've never given up on me
