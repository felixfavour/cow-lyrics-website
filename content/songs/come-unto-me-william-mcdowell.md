Come Unto Me
Open Up Your Heart And Worship
I Am Drawing You To Me
Don't Hesitate
And You Won't Be Disappointed
I Am Everything You Need
Come Unto Me
Oh, Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
When You Seek Me
You Will Find Me
When You Search With All Your Heart
When You Call Me
I Will Answer
I Am Waiting To Be Found By You
(Chorus: PraiseTeam)
ComeUntoMe Open up your heart
Don't Hesitate
Oouuu ooouuu
When You Seek Me
You Will Find Me
When You Search With All Your Heart
When You Call Me
I Will Answer
I Am Waiting To Be Found By You
