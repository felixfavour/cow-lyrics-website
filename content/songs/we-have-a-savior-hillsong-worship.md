A child has been given
The King of our freedom
Sing for the light has come
This is Christmas
Come and adore Him
And bring gifts before Him
Joy to the world
Worship the Son
This is Christmas
Jesus, Emmanuel here with us
Tell all the world
We have a Savior
We have a Savior
We are no longer lost
Cause He has come down for us
We have a Savior
We have a Savior
Sing with the angels
And lift up your voices
Join in the song of hope
This is Christmas
