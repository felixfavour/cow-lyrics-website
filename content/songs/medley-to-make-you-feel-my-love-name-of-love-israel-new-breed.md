Mariah:
When the rain is blowin in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
Israel:
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
Mariah:
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
Ive known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
Id go hungry, Id go black and blue
Id go crawlin down the avenue
Noo, theres nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
Both:
Oooo
Though storms are raging on the rollin sea
And on the highway of regrets
Though winds of change are throwing wild and free
You ain't seen nothin like me yet
Israel:
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
Mariah: to make you feel my love
Both:
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
Love, love , love
Sing!!
Everybody need love
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
Love, love , love
Ooooo
Everybody needs love
Everybody needs love
Love, love , love
