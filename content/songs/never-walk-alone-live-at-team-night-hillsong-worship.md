1 Your heart is for me, Your ear is listening
I’m safe in Your love
Your army of angels watch over me
2 You’re always present, You’re always with me
For all of my life Your favour has followed
You’re my covering
Chorus:
I have never walked alone
I’ve never been abandoned
You are my inheritance
You are my strength and shield
And I have confidence
You go before me
You’re my  deliverer
I know I never walk alone
3 You’re always faithful, You’re strong and able
I’m lifting my head in You I find help
You’re my providence
Bridge:
Every hour, every minute You have always been there
You are faithful and You always will be
In every triumph, every failure You are loyal to me
You are faithful and You always will be
