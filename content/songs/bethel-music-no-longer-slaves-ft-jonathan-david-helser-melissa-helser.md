You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song  of deliverance, from my enemies;
Till all my fears are gone
Chorus: I'm no longer a slave to fear
    I am a child of God (2)
  oo ooh ooh ooh ooh
 Verse 2: From my mother's womb
      You have chosen me
       Your love has covered me
      I have been born again to
    your family
    Your blood flows through my
    veins.
    Repeat chorus (4)
 Verse 3:I am surrounded
     By the arms of the father
     I am surrounded
     By songs of deliverance
     We've been liberated
      From our bondage
       We're are the sons and the
      daughters.
      Let us sing our freedom
Verse 4:. You split the sea
      So I can walk right through
      it
      My fears are drowned in
      perfect love
      You rescued me so I can
       stand and sing
       I am a child of God (2)
       I am a child of God
       Yes I am a hold of God
