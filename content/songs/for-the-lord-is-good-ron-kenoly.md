Enter His gates with thanksgiving
Come into His courts with praise
Enter His presence rejoicing
Singing great and mighty is His name
Praise Him with
The sound of the trumpet
Praise Him with
The timbrel and harp
Let every creature
In Heaven and earth
Lift a sound of praise
Sing with all their heart
For the Lord is good
(For the Lord is good)
For the Lord is good
(For the Lord is good)
For the Lord is good
And His mercy
Endures forever
For the Lord is good
(For the Lord is good)
For the Lord is good
(For the Lord is good)
For the Lord is good
And His mercy
Endures forever
For the Lord is good
And His mercy
Endures forever
