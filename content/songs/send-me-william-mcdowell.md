(Lead:)
Send me I'll go
I'll go to the nations
So the whole world will know
Your love and compassion
The harvest is ready
Your people are hungry
To know you
Send me I'll go
Oh, oh, oh, oh (repeat)
(Chorus:)
Send me I'll go
I'll go to the nations
So the whole world will know
Your love and compassion
The harvest is ready
Your people are hungry
To know you
Send me I'll go
Oh, oh, oh, oh (repeat)
(Lead:)
Give me a heart to hear the cry
Help me to see things through your eyes
That we can bring healing to the broken
When we speak the words that you have spoken
