Chorus:
God is faithful, and He's able to do
Anything is possible; on Him you can depend
He's closer to you than any friend;
Don't ever lose your trust in Him
God is faithful; faithful is our God
God is faithful; faithful is our God
(Repeat Chorus)
He's standing by your side, devoted to His own
There's nothing He won't do; He cares for You
He's closer to you than any friend;
Don't ever lose your trust in Him
God is faithful; faithful is our God
God is faithful; faithful is our God
(Chorus)
