Verse 1
In your blood I found my pardon
Your blood breaks every burden
Unchained my heart from darkness
In your blood we have our victory
We are saved, forgiven
Through the blood of the lamb
The blood of the lamb
We are healed, delivered
Through the blood of the lamb
That was slain
(chorus)
Eje jesu o
Eje jesu oo
Eje jesu oo
Avails for me
Verse 2
Your blood has bought our freedom
From sin, death, hell and darkness
It gave us life eternal
In your blood we have our victory
We are saved ,forgiven
Through the blood of the lamb
The blood of the lamb
We are healed, delivered
Through the blood of the lamb
That was slain
Vamp:
Oh the blood of Christ
Brought me out from darkness
The blood of Jesus makes me whole
Oh the cleansing blood
Full of power and grace
Avails for me
Your blood avails for me.
