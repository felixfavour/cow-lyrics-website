Who will see the Lord
Who is Holy, who is pure
He's coming for His bride
Fill your lamps and dress in white
Who will see the Lord
Who is Holy, who is pure
He’s coming for His bride
Fill your lamps and dress in white
When He comes I'll be ready
For that day I'm preparing
I’ve got oil for the waiting
When He comes I'll be ready
Yes, when He comes I'll be ready
[Hook]
Waiting for You, Lord
[Bridge]
Now behold the One
Riding on the dawn
Every eye will see and believe
Now behold the Son
Every tribe and tongue
All will worship at His feet
