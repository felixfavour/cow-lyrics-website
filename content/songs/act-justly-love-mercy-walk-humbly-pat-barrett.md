It all comes down to this
What you require of me
Love my neighbor as myself
And You above all things
Act justly, love mercy, walk humbly
With You, God
In all things, in all ways, walk humbly
With You, God
It all comes down to this
To be Your hands and feet
Good news to all the world
Oh the truth will set us free
Act justly, love mercy, walk humbly
With You, God
In all things, in all ways, walk humbly
With You, God
[Bridge]
It’s beauty for ashes
It’s mourning to dancing
It’s closer and closer
The Kingdom of heaven
Beauty for ashes
It’s mourning to dancing
It’s closer and closer
The Kingdom of heaven
