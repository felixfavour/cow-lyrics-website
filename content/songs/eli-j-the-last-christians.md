You are the Last Christians
You are the Last
Before the end of the World
We are the Last Christians
We are the Last
Before the end of the World
Have you Packed your Bag
Is your Life intact
There's no Looking Back
Jesus got your Back
Now what if you were asked
Have you Fulfilled your Task
What have you done
With all you Have

We are the Last Christians
We are the Last
Before the end of the World
We are the Last Christians
We are the Last
Before the end of the World
We are the Last Christians
We are the Last
Before the end of the World
We are the Last Christians
We are the Last
Before the end of the World
In the Time of Noah
They didn't have Me
But now they have Me
In the Time of Noah
They didn't have You
But now they have You
[Bridge]
Go Tell the World
(Go Tell the World)
Weather they Listen or not
(Weather they Listen or not)
Singing in our Song
(Singing in our Song)
Sing till Kingdom Come
(Sing till Kingdom Come)
We will Stand our Ground
(Stand our Ground)
Waiting for the Time
(Waiting for the Time)
Rapture is just Around (Just Around)
We're Born for this Time
We will Hold the Line

We are the Last Soldiers
We are the Last
Before the end of the World
We are the Last Christians
We are the Last
Before the end of the World
