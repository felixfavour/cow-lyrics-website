I need You here, I need You here
You're like the rain that falls
Fall on this heart and make me new
I look to You, I look to You
You're king above the earth
And You have put heaven in my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
I only want to be where You are
Holy, holy is the Lord, King of glory
Forever Saviour of the world
I look to You, I look to You
You're king above the earth
And You have put heaven in my heart
[Pre-Chorus]
I only want to be where You are
Holy, holy is the Lord, the King of glory
Forever Saviour of the world
Holy, holy is the Lord, the King of glory
Forever Saviour of the world
