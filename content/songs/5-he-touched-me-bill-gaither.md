SHACKLED BY A HEAVY BURDEN,
NEATH THE LOAD OF GUILT AND SHAME. THEN THE HAND OF JESUS TOUCHED ME, AND NOW I AM NO LONGER THE SAME.

HE TOUCHED ME.  OH HE TOUCHED ME. AND OH THE JOY THAT FLOODS MY SOUL, SOMETHING HAPPENED AND NOW I KNOW HE TOUCHED ME AND HE MADE ME WHOLE.

SINCE I MET THE BLESSED SAVIOR,
SINCE HE CLEANSED AND MADE ME WHOLE. I WILL NEVER CEASE TO PRAISE HIM, I'LL SHOUT IT WHILE ETERNITY ROLLS.

HE TOUCHED ME.  OH HE TOUCHED ME. AND OH THE JOY THAT FLOODS MY SOUL, SOMETHING HAPPENED AND NOW I KNOW HE TOUCHED ME AND HE MADE ME WHOLE.
