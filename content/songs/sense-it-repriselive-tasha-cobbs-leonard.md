[Bridge]
I am not the same
You say it, "I've been changed in Your glory"Close your eyes, lift your hands and say, "I am not the same"Say it, "I've been changed in Your glory"One more time, just the voices say it, come on
I am not the same
I've been changed
(Last time, say it) in Your glory
[Spoken Interlude]
I need every recipient of a miracle
Clap your hands as [?]
But I need you to open your mouth
And act like a miracle just happened in your house
Act like every cancerous tumor
Just dried up
Act like you know that God
[Spontaneous]
Hey, I am not the same
I've been changed
In Your glory
We've been waiting for glory
We've been waiting for glory
Who's been waiting on a miracle?
Prophetically, I declare it
That miracles are happening in your body
Miracles are happening in your finances
Miracles are happening in your relationships
Miracles are happening in your neighborhood
Miracles are happening
I need somebody...
Miracle Worker, we call on You [?]
Miracle Worker, show us a miracle
