Let this simple song I bring
Reach the ears of Majesty
I am falling on my knees
To worship You
[Chorus: Sarah Reeves]
I love You, I love You, I love You
I love You, I love You, I love You
My heart is exploding to tell You
How much I love You, I love You
I love You Lord
[Interlude: Kirk Franklin]
Wow
Let's go
Yeah, yeah
Listen, I'll be honest with You
There's so many things that You allow that I sometimes question
How You feel about me, I know how I feel about You
But the things that You allow
It's very hard to trust Your heart when I can't see Your hand
But as I dig deeper and remember that I was created to love You
Even when I wanna run from You
The love I have for You pulls me back
Since I was a little boy, I've been chasing You as You've been chasing me
And here I am now
Even with my limp I'll run
Even in my tears I'll run
Because I'm running after You 'cause I'm so in love with You
I mean, I'm desperately, crazy, fanatically in love with You
Because I can think of how lost I was
And how incredible You were
To take me in and make me like You
Man, I'm not there yet
But I'm still running, let's go
