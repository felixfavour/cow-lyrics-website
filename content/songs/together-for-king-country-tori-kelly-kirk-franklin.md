[Intro: Choir]
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh, ah
Oh-oh-oh, ah
This is for the busted hearts
This is for the question marks
This is for the outcast soul
Lost control, no one knows
Sing it for the can't-go-back
Sing it for the broken past
Sing it for the just found out
Life is now upside down
[Pre-Chorus: Joel Smallbone]
If you're lookin' for hope tonight, raise your ha-and
If you feelin' alone and don't understa-and
If you're fightin' in the fight of your life, then sta-and
We're gonna make it through this hand-in-ha-and
[Chorus: Joel & Luke Smallbone & Choir]
And if we fall, we will fall together
Together
Ooh, this is for the second chance
This is for the new romance
Sing it for the loved in vain
Overcame, it's not too late
