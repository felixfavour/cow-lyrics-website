It was with a heavy heart that I watched you go away from my hands
I have waited for so long for your return, so welcome home
Since the day that you have left my darling
You remained in my heart
and every night I kept a light up for you to know that you are welcome home
Every single day I prayed for you, for the day that you come back home
it's so Good to find at least see you, so my darling welcome home
welcome home
welcome home
it so good to see you, welcome home
welcome home
welcome home
I've been waiting for you, welcome home
welcome home
welcome home
it's so Good to see you, welcome home
welcome home
welcome home
I've been waiting for you  welcome home
welcome home
welcome home
it's so good to see you welcome home
welcome home
welcome home
I've been waiting for you welcome home
