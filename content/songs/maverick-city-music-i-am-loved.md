All that I am, all that I have
is beautifully made by your hands
There are no questions
There is no doubt
That you look at me and feel proud
You're not embarrassed
you're not ashamed
You stand in wonder
of what you've made
I am loved
I am loved by you
I am loved
I am loved by you
I am loved
I am loved by you
I am loved
I am loved by you
All that I am, all that i have
Is beautifully made by your hands
there are no questions
there is no doubt
that you look at me and feel proud
you're not embarrassed
you're not ashamed
you stand in wonder of what you've made
I am loved
i am loved by you
I am loved
I am loved by you
I am loved
I am loved by you
