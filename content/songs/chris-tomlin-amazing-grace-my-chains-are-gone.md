amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wrenched like me I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see it was grace that thought my heart to feel and grace my fears relieve how precious tear that grace appear  the hour I first believe
my chains are gone I've been set free my God my saviour have answered me and like a flood his mercy and grace unending love amazing grace
the Lord has promised good to me His word my hope secures he wear my shield and  protect me as long I live for him
my chains are gone I've been set free my God my saviour have answered me and like a flood his mercy and grace unending love amazing grace (X2)
the earth shall soon desolve like snow the sun forbear to shine but God who Called me here alone will be forevermore, will be forevermore, you're forevermore
