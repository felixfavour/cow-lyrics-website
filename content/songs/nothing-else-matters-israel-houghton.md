So many pressures in life
So many reasons to throw in the towel
When I feel like I'm losing this fight
Consolation from Heaven comes clearly to me
To remind me, to remind me
Nothing else matters than seeing You, Jesus
Seeking the Master, the one who reigns over my life
Nothing else matters than seeing You, Jesus
Just to sit at Your feet, hear Your voice clearly speak
Lifts me out of defeat, for in You I'm complete
Reminds me nothing else, nothing else matters
You've got so many rivers to cross
So many mountains discouraging you
Just don't focus on yesterday's loss, no
Consolation from Heaven comes clearly to you
To remind you, to remind you
Nothing else than seeing You, Jesus
Seeking the Master, you're the one who reigns over my life
Nothing else matters than seeing You, Jesus
Just to sit at Your feet, hear Your voice clearly speak
Lifts me out of defeat, for in You I'm complete
Just remind me that nothing else, nothing else matters
