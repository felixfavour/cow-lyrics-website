This life that I Live
Is all Yours
I move and have my being
All in You
I'm aligned to your Will
Not mine, but Yours be done
Jesus, as in Heaven
So on Earth
This Song that I bring
Is all Yours
Take my heart, take all of Me
If you're looking for a Man
If you're looking for a Vessel
I say YES, Amen, I say YES
My Song is YES
Yes, Yes, Lord
In your Sufficiency
Yes, Yes, Lord
If you're looking for a Man
If you're looking for a Vessel
I say YES, Amen, I say YES
This air that I Breathe
Is all Yours
Concecrated unto thee
If you need a Man to Pray
Here I am, Lord
I say YES, Amen, I say YES
This Hands that I Lift
Is all Yours
Take the Glory, Father
Take the Praise
If you're looking for
Just one Man
If you're looking for a Vessel
I say YES, Amen, I say YES
My Song is YES
Yes, Yes, Lord
In your Sufficiency
Yes, Yes, Lord
If you're looking for a Man
If you're looking for a Vessel
I say YES, Amen, I say YES
My Song is YES
Yes, Yes, Lord
In your Sufficiency
Yes, Yes, Lord
If you're looking for a Man
If you're looking for a Vessel
I say YES, Amen, I say YES
What is Life
If it's not lived for You
(You, you, you)
What is Life,
If I don't shout your PRAISE
Your, Your Praise
What is Life If I don't tell
You are coming Soon
You're coming again
I say YES, Amen, I say YES
Lah, lah, lah, lah
La, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah, lah
Lah, lah, lah, lah
Lah, lah, lah, lah
...
I say YES, YES, Amen
