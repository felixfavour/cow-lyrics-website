For someone facing incredible obstacles in your life
I want you to lean on God and trust his flawless record
He never fails, he can do the impossible
How do I know? I've seen him do it!

I have no doubt my God can do the impossible
I know He can, I've seen Him do it
He can turn the mess you're in to an awesome miracle
I know He can, I've seen Him do it
Whatever problem you've got
If you just give it to God, He'll work it out
How do I know?

I've seen him do it, I've seen him do it
I've seen him do it, I've seen him do it
I've seen him do it, I've seen him do it
I've seen him do it, I've seen him do it

When your life has gone astray
He'll preserve and cover you with His grace
That's how God works; I've seen Him do it
And He'll erase your past
So people can never dangle it in your face
That's how God works, I've seen Him do it
When you need a miracle, He's more than capable
How do I know? How do I know?

God never fails, my God never fails I've seen Him
God never fails, my God never fails I've seen Him

I've seen him do it, I've seen him do it yes
I've seen him do it, I've seen him do it yes
I've seen him do it, I've seen him do it
I've seen him do it yes, I've seen him do it
I've seen him do it yes, I've seen him do it
I've seen him do it, I've seen him do it!
