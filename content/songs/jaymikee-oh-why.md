Questioning puzzles and questions of faith
Everyone wondering what is their fate oh why oh oh why
Why do children cry,
Why do people die why do nations fight rather than unite oh oh why
It doesn't matter whatever comes my way
Every situation is working for my good
Yes I believe yes I believe
I have come so far but by your Spirit and so
I have come so far but by your Spirit and so
That is why I will put my trust in You and You alone
I may not understand everything about you it doesn't
Matter but I will put my trust in You and You alone.
I may not have all I want but in You I have
Everything I will put my trust in You and You alone
Prophecies, visions, and revelations
Everyone searching for answers, oh why oh why, oh oh why
They ask why do prayers not get answered,
Why do children of God seem yo suffer, oh why, oh oh why
As for me, it doesn't matter whatever comes
My way every situation is probably for my good
Yes I believe yes I believe
I have come so far but by your Spirit and so
That is why I will put my trust in You and You alone
I may not understand everything about you it doesn't
Matter but I will put my trust in You and You alone.
I may not have all I want but in You I have
Everything I will put my trust in You and You alone
Eh oh eh oh eh oh yeah I will put my trust on You and You alone
I may not understand every thing but I will put my trust in You alone
I may not understand but I will put my trust in You
