Just because my skin is brown
It don't define who I am
I could be a porcupine
Or I could be a little lamb
Please don't try and judge me
Only by the colors you have seen
To love me is to know me
Whether red, yellow, black or green
Cause color is skin deep
But true beauty lives on and on
Color is skin deep
But true beauty lives on and on
Her skin might be ivory
And he might be from Japan
But that don't make a better woman
That don't make a lesser man
Please don't try to judge 'em
Only by the colors you have seen
To love 'em is to know 'em
Whether red, yellow, white, or green
