You fill me up
Strength for the journey
Always enough
When I am lonely You're there
Everything I need
Love all around
You'll never leave me alone
When I'm ready to give up
Lord, You won't let me go
You keep holding me
When I'm ready to give up
Lord, You won't let me go
You keep holding me
Still at the end
Right where I was
You came to find
Dependable god
You've been a friend
I can count on you
You never deny me
You're there whenever I'm in need
Goodness and mercy
Shall follow me (follow me), I'm not alone
I'm never alone, here's why
When I'm ready to give up
Lord, You won't let me go
You keep holding me
When I'm ready to give up
Lord, You won't let me go
You keep holding me
When I'm ready to give up
Lord, You won't let me go
You keep holding me
When I'm ready to give up
Lord, You won't let me go
You keep holding me
This one is for those, who feel like you're at your end
For the single moms, for the one who's sick, for the one at war
Keep your head up, and know that God won't let you go
You won't let me go
You got me, I know
There's safety in Your arms
You won't let me go
You won't let me go
You got me, I know
There's safety in Your arms
And no matter what
You won't let me go
You won't let me go
You got me, I know
There's safety in Your arms
You won't let me go
When I'm ready to give up
Lord, You won't let me go
You keep holding me
When I'm ready to give up
Lord, You won't let me go
You keep holding me
Never let me go
Never let me go
There's safety in Your arms
You won't let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
There's safety in Your arms
And you never will
You won't let me go
