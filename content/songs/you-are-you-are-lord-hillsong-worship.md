You are my light and salvation, whom shall I fear?
You are the strength of all my days, of whom shall I be afraid?
[Pre-Chorus]
Though war may rise against me, of this will I be sure
That I will bless the Lord forever, I'll bless Your holy name
Yes, I will bless the Lord forever, I'll bless Your holy name
Lord, it is You I desire, it's You that I seek
To live with You in Your house forever, beholding Your beauty
[Pre-Chorus]
And in the time of trouble, of this will I be sure
That I will bless the Lord forever, I'll bless Your holy name
Yes, I will bless the Lord forever, I'll bless Your holy name
[Bridge]
You ask me who do I
Say that You are, and I
Say that You are the Christ
Son of the living God
You ask me who do I
Say that You are, and I
Say that You are the Christ
Son of the living God
You ask me who do I
Say that You are, and I
Say that You are the Christ
Son of the living God
You ask me who do I
Say that You are, and I
Say that You are the Christ
Son of the living God
