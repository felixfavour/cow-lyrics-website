You are the love of my life
You are the hope that I cling to
You mean, more than this world to me
I wouldn't trade You for silver or gold
I wouldn't trade You for riches untold
You are, you are my everything
You are the love of my life
You are the hope that I cling to
You mean, more than this world to me
I wouldn't trade You for silver or gold
I wouldn't trade You for riches untold
You are, you are my everything
I wouldn't take one step without You
I could never go on
I couldn't live one day without You
I don't have the strength
To make it on my own
You are the love of my life
You are the hope that I cling to
You mean, more than this world to me
I wouldn't trade You for silver or gold
I wouldn't trade You for riches untold
You are, you are my everything
