ve Never Fails - Israel Houghton
Composed byï¼Martha Munizzi/Israel Houghton/Meleasa Houghton
You never turn away the ones who seek your face
You never will forsake the ones who call your name
You never separate the ones you came to save
You never ever change yesterday today forever
Your love your love never fails
Your love never fails
Your love your love never fails
Your promise over me
Is all I'll ever need
Your promise will endure
Unshaken and secure
Your promises are mine
Beyond the reach of time
Your promises are yes
Your people say amen
Forever
Your love your love never fails
Your love your love never fails
It endures forever
Your love
Your love your love your love never fails
Never
Your love your love never fails
It endures forever
It never it will never never fail
It never will it never will
Your love won't fail it never will
It never will it never will
Your love won't fail it never will
It never will it never will
Your love won't fail it never will
It never will it never will
Your love won't fail it never will
Your love your love it never fails
Your love your love never fails
And it never will it never will
Your love won't fail it never will
It never will it never will
Your love won't fail it never will
It never will it never will
Your love won't fail it never will
It never will it never will
Your love won't fail it never will
Oh never will
