God reminded me of the children of Israel and how they wanted a king because everyone else had a king. But what they didn't recognize is that they had the King of kings. And God stopped me in my tracks one day while I was praying and said "Travis quit searching for what you already have. You have the Father of fathers". And I don't know who you are tonight but you've been searching for your identity and God says that you'll find it all in him. He says, "Listen homie I never missed a ball game". He says, "Daughter I was there at your graduation." I feel a wind of restoration blowing through and God is giving you back your identity. What you've been searching for, what someone stole from you, God said, "No, no, no, you belong to me daughter. You belong to me man of God. I am your identity. You can have my last name. Everything you've been wanting you can find in me. I am your father."
You've been searching for your identity
Someone to give you hope and something you could believe
Search no longer, He's waiting for you
The search is over, all you have to do is let me
Daddy's home, oh
Daddy's home, oh
Daddy's home, oh
Daddy's home, oh
You've been searching for your identity
Someone to give you hope and something you could believe
Search no longer, He's waiting for you
The search is over, all you have to do is let me
Search no longer, He's waiting for you
The search is over, all you have to do is let me
Daddy's home, oh
Daddy's home, oh
Daddy's home, oh
Daddy's home, oh
You're not forsaken
You belong to me
You belong to me
And I'm here for you
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me
And I'm here for you
For you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you
I'm here for you
Daddy's home
Never forsakes us
Never leaves us alone
Daddy's home, woah
Daddy's home, woah
I am that I am
And I am here for you
[x4]
I call you son
I call you daughter
I am your father
You belong to me and I'm here for you
