[Intro]
For his goodness and for his wonderful works
Unto the children of men
If my people will lift my name tonight
I will come in! I will be exalted!
I will be glorified! I will be lifted up!
Welcome him in tonight
Can't you feel him? Yes, yes
There is liberty
Open your heart tonight
Welcome him in, put them hands together
Fellowship, joy and peace
All praise to the all-eye seeing supreme-being
Giver of joy and peace, love supreme freedom
See him in your son, see him in the daughters
The mountains, the waters, all divine order
The king unseen, one dream that I had, I was talking to my dad
He said, "Things ain't as bad as they seem"Is this a God dream the way 'Ye sing it?
The dream seemed to go on as the day lingered
The meaning of life, you can't frame or name it
True stars remain like the name of David
Niggas get foreign cars and think they made it
It ain't yours 'til you create it
In the image of the beneficent, merciful, universal, versatile
My verses go 'til Heaven and Earth become reversible
Christ particle
, so anything is possible
Fuck big brother, father, mother, God is watching you
