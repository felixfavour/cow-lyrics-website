O fe ma wu lori mi
O fe ma wu lori mo Gb'oruka Nazarene
Kini wura simi ?
Kini silifa ?
Kini Capital ?
I'll never trade you for nothing
See me as I am
I'm rolling deep
We're intertwined oh I fill out your mind
See me as I am
I'm staggering
For your love's a rarity, it's very hard to find
O'n gbe mi soke o
O'n gbe mi dele o
Orun o Jina mo
O'n gbe mi debe o
O'n fun mi la la la lafia e
Ko le seni, maseni ta le fi o we
We're locked in Harmony
We're locked in synergy
There's none in-between
It's written in the stars for me
Written in the sands, my feet, are in your oceans deep
See me as I am
I wanna see
Your full glory all over me
See me as I am
I wanna feel
You closer than closer to me.
O'n gbe mi soke o
O'n gbe mi dele o
Orun o Jina mo
O'n gbe mi debe o
O'n fun mi la la la lafia e
Ko le seni, maseni ta le fi o we
