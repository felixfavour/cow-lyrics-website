Take this cup
Drink of Me
Take this bread
Think of Me
These were the Words...
You spoke to me
So whenever I'm lonely
I won't Forget
I Remember
What You Said
I Remember
What You Did
You have made all things new
God I, Remember You
I Remember You
Take My yoke
Come to Me
Take this rest I'm all you need
These were the Words that You
spoke to me
So whenever I'm lonely
I won't Forget
I Remember
What You Said
I Remember
What You Did
You have made all things new
God I, Remember You
I Remember You
You said You're with me
I Know You Won't Leave
You said You're with me
I won't Forget
You said You're with me
I Know You Won't Leave
You said You're with me
I won't Forget
Goodness & Mercy
Is Following me
You said You're with me
I won't Forget
Goodness & Mercy
Is Following me
You said You're with me
I won't Forget
I Remember What You Said
I Remember What You Promised
I Won't Forget
You have made all things new
God I, Remember You
I Remember You
I Remember You.
