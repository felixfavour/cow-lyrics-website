Gabriel's golden trumpet sounds, all the saints will leave the ground. They are rising up to meet the blessed Lord. Oh, how they shout as they rise, to their home beyond the skies. They're in the Bride of Christ, and they are coming home. 

And here they come, Oh, what a thrill! Here they come, marching up Zion's hill; the victory's won, as they bow before God's song. The bride of Jesus is coming home!

Here comes mom and here comes down, oh their faces look so glad. As they march and they sing redemption's song. Oh what a smile upon their face, as they sing "Amazing Grace," they're in the bride of Christ and they are coming home. 

And here they come, Oh, what a thrill! Here they come, marching up Zion's hill; the victory's won, as they bow before God's song. The bride of Jesus is coming home!
