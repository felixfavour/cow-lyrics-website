I have heard so many songs
Listened to a thousand tongues
But there is one that sounds above them all
The Father's song, the Father's love
You sung it over me
And for eternity it's written on my heart
Heaven's perfect melody
The Creator's symphony
You are singing over me
The Father's song
Heaven's perfect mystery
The King of Love has sent for me
Now You're singing over me
The Father's song
I have heard so many songs
Listened to a thousand tongues
But there is one that sounds above them all (sounds above them all)
The Father's song, the Father's love
You sung it over me
And for eternity it's written on my heart
Heaven's perfect melody
The Creator's symphony
You are singing over me
The Father's song
