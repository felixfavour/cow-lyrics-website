I should have been the guilty one
You took the blame for everything
I should have been in exile
You became the door to freedom
I used to live in the darkness
Searching for a way of escape
Then You turned the light on
Now I can see, now I can see
You?re the answer for the world
The Healer of our hearts
Oh, what a wonder You are
You?re my all-sufficiency
The Author of forgiveness
Oh, what a wonder, a wonder working God
Once I was a stranger
You welcomed me as a long lost friend
Now I have a future
Found in the Son, found in the Son
You?re the answer for the world
The Healer of our hearts
Oh, what a wonder You are
