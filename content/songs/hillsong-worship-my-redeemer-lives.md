I know He rescued my soul
 (With His blood) ,  He covered my sins,  I believe,  I believe...
My shame is taken away, my pain is healed in His name, I believe,  I believe...
I'll raise a banner,  'cos my Lord has conquered the grave
(My Redeemer lives x4)
(Back to I know)
(My Redeemer lives x16)
You lift my burden,  I'll rise with you
I'm standing on this mountain top...
To see your kingdom come...
(Back to My Redeemer Lives)
