Standing here in Your presence
In a grace so relentless
I am won by perfect love
Wrapped within the arms of heaven
In a peace that lasts forever
Sinking deep in mercy's sea
I'm wide awake
Drawing close, stirred by grace
All my heart is Yours
All fear removed
I breathe You in, I lean into Your love
Oh, oh-ooh-oooh, Your love
When I'm lost You pursue me
Lift my head to see Your glory
Lord of all, so beautiful
Here in You I find shelter
Captivated by the splendour
Of Your face, my secret place
For I'm wide awake
Drawing close, stirred by grace
And all my heart is Yours
All fear removed
I breathe You in, I lean into Your love
Oh, oh-ooh-oooh, Your love
