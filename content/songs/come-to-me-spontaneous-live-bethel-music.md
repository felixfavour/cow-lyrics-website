[Instrumental]
'Cause I am the Lord, your God
I go before you now
I stand beside you, I'm all around you
Though you feel I'm far away
I'm closer than your breath
I am with you, wherever you go
Oh, I am the Lord, your Peace
No evil will conquer you
Steady now your heart and mind
And come into My rest
And oh let your faith arise
Lift up your weary head
I am with you, wherever you go
So come to Me, 'cause I'm all you need
Come to Me, I'm everything
Come to Me, 'cause I'm all you need
Come to Me, I'm everything
[Bridge 1: Jenn Johnson]
'Cause I am your anchor, in the wind and the waves
And I am your steadfast, so don't be afraid
If your heart and flesh fail you
Oh, I'm your faithful strength
I am with you, wherever you go
