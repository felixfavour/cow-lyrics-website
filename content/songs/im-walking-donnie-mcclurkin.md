I'm walking in authority, living life without apology
It's not wrong, dear, I belong here
So you might as well get used to me
My mother may not be a queen
But my Father's King of everything
I'm adopted into the family
So I guess that makes me royalty
And He's given me dominion yes (oh)
Power over men, them yes (oh)
Everything I do is blessed (oh)
Promised me some great success (oh)
I am the authority (oh)
God of the majority (oh)
Livin' in my liberty (oh)
So you might as well get used to me
I'm walking in authority, living life without apology
It's not wrong, dear, I belong here
So you might as well get used to me
We're children of the most-high God
Understand and believe His word
We never have to beg or plead
For our Father will supply our needs
