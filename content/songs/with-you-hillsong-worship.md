I will sing about everything You are always
I will tell the world everything You've done in me
[Pre-Chorus]
I stand on higher ground
I was lost but now I'm here
With You, my refuge, my stronghold
Always with You, faithful one, holding on
I am always with You
The future of the world is within Your hands of love
Love reaches me, I am in awe of You
[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I stand on higher ground
I was lost but now I'm here
With You, my refuge, my stronghold
Always with You, faithful one, holding on
I am always with You, my refuge, my stronghold
Always with You, faithful one, holding on
I am always with You
