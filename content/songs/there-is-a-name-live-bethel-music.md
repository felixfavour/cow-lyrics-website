There is a name
Who reigns without contention
Whose power can't be questioned or contained
With humble fame
He rules the earth and heavens
His glory knows no measure or refrain
And it's bursting past the border lines of space
Jesus, enthroned upon the praises of our hearts
Jesus, You're the King and You're the center of it all
There is a name
Reaching past the margins
Calling sons and daughters back to Him
And as He saves
We can hear the roar of Heaven
As prodigals are coming home again
Oh the triumph
Oh the triumph of His name will never end, oh-ohh
Jesus, enthroned upon the praises of our hearts
Jesus, You're the King and You're the center of it all
