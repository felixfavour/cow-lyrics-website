Every time I clap my hands
Every time I lift my voice
Every time I call Your name
It's an attack on the enemy
So let's wage war right now
My praise is my weapon tonight
My praise is my weapon tonight
Every time I clap my hands
Every time I lift my voice
Every time I call Your name
It's an attack on the enemy
So let's wage war right now
My praise is my weapon tonight
My praise is my weapon tonight
My praise is my weapon tonight
My praise is my weapon tonight
[Bridge]

I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon
I'll use my weapon
I'll use my weapon
I'll use my weapon
I'll use my weapon
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon and confuse the enemy
I'll use my weapon
