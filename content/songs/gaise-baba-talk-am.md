Some people go dey vex for me for this song oo
I no say dey go vex for me for this song
Some people go dey vex for me for this song eh
But I know say no be only me dey think am
Some people go dey vex for me for this song
But I know say no be only me dey think am
Ododo oro o le wuwo lati so, oya Make you talk am
Some people go dey vex for me for this song
But I know say no be only me dey think am
Ododo oro o le wuwo lati so, Gaise Baba go talk am
Evening service Wednesday, Choir Practice Saturday
To ba tun di Sunday, Service meji la ma se
21 days, 100 days, se lan gba awe, a gba Adura
yet it seems we've been waiting forever
feels like God is dulling
the other side tempting and calling
unbelievers balling, that is why many are porting
I dey wonder, I dey vex ehhh
plenty questions on my heart ehhh
like how darkness go dey shine pass light oo
Some people go dey vex for me for this song
But I know say no be only me dey think am
Ododo oro o le wuwo lati so, oya Make you talk am
Some people go dey vex for me for this song
But I know say no be only me dey think am
Ododo oro o le wuwo lati so, Gaise Baba go talk am
Oya come make we talk o
let us have an intellectual discuss
Oluwa lo ran mi ma de so
so many things need to change inside the church o
you know I'm all about the music
so I take it personal when it is looking like
if I'm not leading worship
all of my musical gifts I can't use it
and we know that this Is a Kingdom
where gifts are given in many forms
so everyone cannot conform, to one form
a le jo face ona kan oo
this is a tough conversation o
asiko ti to,
we cant run any longer, and act like nothing is wrong
Gaise baba ti de make we talk am o
 people go dey vex for me for this song
But I know say no be only me dey think am
Ododo oro o le wuwo lati so, oya Make you talk am
Some people go dey vex for me for this song
But I know say no be only me dey think am
Ododo oro o le wuwo lati so, Gaise Baba go talk am
