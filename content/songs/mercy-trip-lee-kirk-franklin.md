[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Yeah, I dedicate this song to those that miss being dedicated
The world robbed you of your spiritual romance and you want to renew your vows
Jesus waits at the altar for you
He's not wearing a watch, so you still have time
Heavy heart at the start of the day light
In the sun or the rain, you will still shine
Wipe my eyes when I cry be my delight
When in doubt, then I realize
In the dark there you are
You’re still good, You’re still good
Life gеts hard falls apart
You’re still good, You’re still good
[Pre-Chorus: Choir]
I been shooting for the stars (shoot)
Just tryna bе where You are
It don’t matter what it cost (shoot)
I would rather lose it all
I been shooting for the stars (shoot)
Just tryna be where You are
It don’t matter what it cost (shoot)
I would rather lose it all
