I'll wait for You to come
I'll wait for You to come
Cause when I'm with You Lord
It always leaves me wanting more
Here's our praise You can dwell within
Come again
Come again
Let the glory in
I'm open, I'm open
Come again
Let the glory in
I'm open, I'm open
I'll wait for You to come
I'll wait for You to come
Cause when I'm with You Lord
It always leaves me wanting more
Here's our praise You can dwell within
Come again
Come again
Let the glory in
I'm open, I'm open
I'll wait for You to come
I'll wait for You to come
Cause when I'm with You Lord
It always leaves me wanting more
Here's our praise You can dwell within
Come again
Come again
Let the glory in
I'm open, I'm open
It's not a building you wanna fill
It's my heart
This empty space
Is what you wanted all along
Come again
Let the glory in
I'm open, I'm open
