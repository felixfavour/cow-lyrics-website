When I was a child
I never thought I'd see the day
When my old face would grow old
And my hair would turn to gray
But now Father Time has taken his brush
And begun to paint my face
And it makes me kind of sad to know
Those lines just won't erase
What will you do with your life?
Soon it will all be gone (don't let it slip away)
Give your life to Jesus
And someday He'll take you home
What will you do with your life?
Looking back at your childhood
It seems like yesterday
Now you look at your raging face
And all those lines won't go away
So you dress a little younger, you walk a little faster
Trying to stay young in your mind
But the next thing that you know, my friend
You'll be out of time
What will you do with your life?
What will you do with your life?
Soon it will all be gone
Give your life to Jesus
And someday He'll take you home
What will you do with your life?
