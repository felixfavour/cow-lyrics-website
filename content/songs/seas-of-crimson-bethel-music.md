For every curse, You're the cure
For every sickness, You're the healer
For every storm, You're the calm
For all thatâ€™s lost, oh, what a Savior
On that cross of calvary
Every burden has been defeated
And every wretched heart redeemed
You drown our sins in seas of crimson
Hallelujah death is beaten
Christ has risen from the grave
Hallelujah it is finished
All to You the highest praise
On that day of utmost glory
All of darkness cannot carry
Every shackle will come undone
My solid rock thine is the kingdom
Every shackle will come undone
My solid rock thine is the kingdom
Hallelujah death is beaten
Christ has risen from the grave
Hallelujah it is finished
All to You the highest praise
