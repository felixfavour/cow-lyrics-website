I was hopeless, I knew I was lost, and death and darkness were my only songs. I needed someone to come resuce me, and mercy heard my please. 

And Lord, you found me, you healed me, you called me from the grave. You gave me your real love, thank you Jesus. You washed my sins away, and now I'm living, I got forgiven. You came to set me free, and that's what your mercy did for me. 

You gave me beauty for my guilty stains, and now I'm living day to day by His grace. So excuse me if i can't contain my praise, 'cause I know that I've been saved. 

Lord, you found me, you healed me, you called me from the grave. You gave me your real love, thank you Jesus. You washed my sins away, and now I'm living, I got forgiven. You came to set me free, and that's what your mercy did for me. 

And every morning mercy will restore me, I will proclaim. And even if the world may fall before me, I will proclain. 

Cause Lord, you found me, you healed me, you called me from the grave. You gave me your real love, thank you Jesus. You washed my sins away, and now I'm living, I got forgiven. You came to set me free, and that's what your mercy did for me

That's what your mercy did for me. 
That's what your mercy did for me. 
And that's what your mercy did for me.
And that's what your mercy did for me.
And that's what your mercy did for me.
