No shadow comes without the light making a way
No raging storm can ever defy one word of faith
My heart remains sure in the wind, sure in the waves
You are the anchor for my soul
You won't let go
You won't let go
No matter what may come I know
You won't let go
No valley low, changes the truth
So I'm not afraid
You hold me close
You lead me through and light up the way
You are the anchor for my soul
You won't let go
You won't let go
No matter what may come I know
You won't let go
You won't let go
Neither life, neither death,
The highest high, the deepest depth
Nothing can
Nothing can separate
Neither tears, neither trials
Certain as the sun will rise
Nothing can
Nothing can separate
[x2]
You are the anchor for my soul
You won't let go
You won't let go
No matter what may come I know
You won't let go
My heart remains sure in the wind, sure in the waves, always
