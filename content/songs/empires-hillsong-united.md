We are worlds we are bodies
Empires of dirt and grace
Silhouettes and reflections
Caught in his holy flame
[Pre-Chorus]
Beneath our skin
A new creation
The night is done
Our chains are broken
The time has come
The wait is over
The King is here
And His Name is Jesus
This is love
Bending skies to heal the broken
This is love
Bleeding life into the grave
Hear the sound
As our hearts cry out forever
Singing hallelujah
Breathing in a brand new world
