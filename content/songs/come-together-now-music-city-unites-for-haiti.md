There is hurt, there is trouble
There are tears on the ground
From the ash and the rubble
There's a cry ringing out
You've been shaken by love
You've been shattered by fear
Give me eyes that can see it
Give me ears that can hear
When you're hurt, I am hurting
When you're bleeding, I bleed
When you cry, I am crying
I am down on my knees
When there's nothing left standing
And there's no reason why
Let's go walking on the water
'Til we reach the other side
Stretch your arms
And help the brokenhearted
Say a prayer that change will come
We will fight
For the children who are hurting
Let's stand as one and come together now
