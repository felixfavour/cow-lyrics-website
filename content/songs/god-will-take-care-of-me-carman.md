Moses knew it way back in Egypt land
Said it to himself, said it over again
My God will take care of me
God's people, workin' hard in the blazin' sun
Said it to themselves, said it one by one
My God will take care of me
He will, he will deliver me from these chains
And walk me through the valley of shadow and death again
He will, he will, just watch and you will see
My God will take care of me
Written by the finger of God back then
Written on stone and the hearts of man
My God will take care of me
Hear it 'cross the land, hear the people cry
Believe it in my heart 'til the day I die
My God will take care of me
He will, he will deliver me from these chains
And walk me through the valley of shadow and death again
He will, he will, just watch and you will see
My God will take care of me
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
