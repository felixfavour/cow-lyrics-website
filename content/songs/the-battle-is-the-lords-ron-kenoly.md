When the mighty men
From the tribe of Judah
Faced the enemy
They were told by God
Not to be afraid
He would give the victory
He said lift up a song
And lay down the sword
For the battle is mine
Says the Lord
Sing unto the Lord
Make a joyful sound
Lift your voices
And let your praise resound
Sing a victory song
In the time of war
Trust in Jesus
The battle is the Lord´s
(Repeat)
When the evil one
Comes against you
To fill your heart with fear
You can trust in God
He wil never leave you
He promised to be near
You can lift up a song
In the midst of the war
For the battle is mine
Says the Lord
