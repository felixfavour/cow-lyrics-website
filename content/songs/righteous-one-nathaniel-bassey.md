Righteous One, holy One, Emmanuel
You are God with us Jesus Christ, anointed One
You are Messiah, my heart's desire
Is to know You much more
To live and walk in Your will
Is to love You much more
Beholding the glory of Your face
Righteous One, righteous One
That's who You are
Who You are, that's who You are, ooh
Wonderful, beautiful, glorious
Bright and morning star
Spotless lamb, son of God
Kin's man redeemer, my heart desire
Is to know You much more
To live and walk in Your will
My God, is to know You much more
Beholding the beauty of Your grace
Righteous One, righteous One, that's who You are
My desire is to know You, know You much more
I want to hear You and walk in Your ways, Jesus
Oh, I want to know You much more
Know You much more, Lord
To carry the beauty of Your grace
You're the righteous One, the righteous One

Everything about You
