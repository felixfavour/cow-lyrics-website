Like a blind man I wandered, so lost and undone, a beggar so helpless, without God or His son. Then my Savior in mercy, heard and answered my cry. And Oh what a difference, since Jesus passed by!

Since Jesus passed by, since Jesus passed by. Oh what a difference since Jesus passed by. Well. I cant explain it, and I cannot tell you why, but oh what a difference, since Jesus passed by!

All my yesterdays are buried, in the deepest of the sea; the old load of guilt I carried is all gone, praise God I'm free. Looking for that bright tomorrow, where no tears will dim the eye, well, oh what a difference since Jesus passed by!

Since Jesus passed by, since Jesus passed by. Oh what a difference since Jesus passed by. Well. I cant explain it, and I cannot tell you why, but oh what a difference, since Jesus passed by!
