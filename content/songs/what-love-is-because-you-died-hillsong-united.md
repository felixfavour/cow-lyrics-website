I don't have the mind
To understand the weight of Your glory
Or what it takes to author the origin of light
Or the mystery of life, or the heart just to love me
Oh, but this much I know
Everything I have is because You died for me, oh
And nothing in this world could ever take that much from me
I don't have the heart
To measure up against the pressure
But all my strength exists in the confidence I find
In the thrill of Your desire and the power of Your presence, O Lord
So my soul will sing
Everything I have is because You died for me, O Lord
And nothing in this world could ever take that much from me
Everything else comes down to this
I know Your love is why my soul exists (Oh)
And nothing on Earth compares to the confidence I find
In the thrill of Your desire and the power of Your presence (Oh), oh
So my soul will sing
Everything I have is because You died for me (Oh)
And nothing in this world could ever take that much from me (Hallelu)
