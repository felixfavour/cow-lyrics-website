We come​ alive
To magnify
The praises of our God
The rocks cry out
If we don't shout
The praises of our God
There's ​nothing that
Can stand against
The praises of our God
We will defeat
The enemy
With the praises of our God
Oh! Sing praise to our God
For His Name is, worthy, worthy
Oh! Sing praise to our God
For our God is, worthy, worthy
