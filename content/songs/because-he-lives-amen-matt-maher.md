I believe in the Son
I believe in the risen One
I believe I overcome
By the power of His blood
Amen, Amen
I'm alive, I'm alive
Because He lives
Amen, Amen
Let my song join 
the one that never ends
Because He lives
I was dead in the grave
I was covered in sin and shame
I heard mercy call my name
He rolled the stone away
Amen, Amen
I'm alive, I'm alive
Because He lives
Amen, Amen
Let my song join the one that never ends
