Closer than my dreams
Lord I know You
You're near me You're near me
Your everlasting arms
They surround me
You hold me You hold me
PreChorus:
Carry my world in Your nail-scarred hands
Breathing Your hope and Your life in me
Chorus:
No more than a heartbeat away
No more than a heartbeat away
Wherever I go I know that You're there
No more than a heartbeat away
Every word I pray
Lord You listen
My Saviour You hear me
Watching over me
Every moment
You keep me You keep me
Bridge:
You'll never leave me without You
You'll never leave me alone
You'll never leave me without You
'Cause I know You'll always be there
