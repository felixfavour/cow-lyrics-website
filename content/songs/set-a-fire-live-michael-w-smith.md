[Chorus]
Set a fire down in my soul
That I can't contain, that I can't control
I want more of You, God
I want more of You, God
Set a fire down in my soul
That I can't contain, that I can't control
I want more of You, God
I want more of You, God
Set a fire down in my soul
That I can't contain, that I can't control
I want more of You, God
I want more of You, God
Set a fire down in my soul
That I can't contain, that I can't control
I want more of You, God
I want more of You, God
Set a fire down in my soul
That I can't contain, that I can't control
I want more of You, God
I want more of You, God
Set a fire down in my soul
That I can't contain, that I can't control
I want more of You, God
I want more of You, God
