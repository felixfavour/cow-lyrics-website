I pour my heart out for you
and it's like an ocean, oh it's so deep
ei ee I owe my life,
and it's my debt, please let me pay it
cos there will be nightmares, when you don't lay with me
but if you close your eyes, how would I see?
and your word's like a t-shirt,
can I put it on? cos everytime I wear it,
I'm covered in your love
I'm hanging on every single word that you said
oh and I want you on every part of me
and when the world is tumbling with you I am saved,
in your arms where I want to be
cos there will be nightmares, when you don't lay with me
Lord if you close your eyes, how would I see?
and your word's like a t-shirt,
can I put it on? cos everytime I wear it,
I'm covered in your love
there will be nightmares, when you don't lay with me
lord if you close your eyes, how would I see?
and your word's like a t-shirt,
can I put it on? cos everytime I wear it,
I'm covered in your love
and though you feed me better
if it ain't your home, it's not my shelter (shelter)
and would you come close? cos I don't need any distance, no I won't need it
cos there will be nightmares, when you don't lay with me
Lord if you close your eyes, how would I see?
and your word's like a t-shirt,
