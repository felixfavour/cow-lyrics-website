When I think upon Your goodness;
And Your faithfulness each day
I'm convinced it's not because I am worthy
To receive the kind of love that You give
But I'm grateful for Your mercy,
And I'm grateful for Your grace
And because of how You've poured out Yourself
I have come to sing this song out in praise
Imela! Imela! (Thank You! Thank You!)
Okaka, Onyekeruwa (Great and Might creator of the world)
Imela! Imela! (Thank You! Thank You!)
Eze m Oh (My King)
Who am I to sing Your praises?
Who am I to worship You?
It's Your blood that makes the difference in me
And made a way to enter into Your throne
I could not come near Your presence
I could never sing Your song
But the sacrifice on Calvary's tree
Is the reason I can cry out today
Imela! Imela! (Thank You! Thank You!)
Okaka, Onyekeruwa (Great and Might creator of the world)
Imela! Imela! (Thank You! Thank You!)
