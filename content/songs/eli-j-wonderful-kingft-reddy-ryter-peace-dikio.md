You are that man, your love never fails
You are that man, who never goes back on his words
     chorus
There's no lover like you
wonderful king, beautiful God
there is none like you (2)
There's no God like you
wonderful king, beautiful God
there is none like you (2)
You are that man, your love heals the sick
You are that man, who never goes back on his words
There's no Jesus like you
wonderful king, my beautiful God
there is none like you (2)
There's no God like you
my wonderful king, beautiful God
there is none like you (2)
I have searched and truly
I've never seen your kind of love
I've never seen (2)
I've never seen your kind of love
I've never seen (2)
repeat chorus
