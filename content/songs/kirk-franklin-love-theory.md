Brothers and sisters
I wanna welcome you back to life
Back to the One that can make your next chapter
Your best chapter
Hallelujah
How can it be?
That you love the most unlovable part of me?
Of me?
How could you see?
Your life was the only gift I'll ever need
To be free?
It's amazing with you, I win even if I lose
Everything's working for my good for always
He saved the day
He will come through
He won't doubt, that's not what super heroes do (Hallelujah)
No greater love makes my heart beat
All I wanna do is make you proud of me (that's why)
I don't wanna love nobody but you
I don't wanna love nobody but you
I don't wanna love nobody, love nobody but you (let's go)
How can it be?
Everyone of my secrets that you keep
You cover me
You cover me (I appreciate it)
A mystery (it's amazing how), your patience with me, God, will never leave (you don't give up on me)
Don't ever leave
Help me to see like you
No matter what I go through
Everything's working for my good for always (lemme tell you what he does)
He saved the day (and he will)
He will come through (Hallelujah)
He won't doubt, that's not what super heroes do (not real super heroes)
No greater love (a love like this) makes my heart beat (and I promise ya)
All I wanna do is make you proud of me (that's why)
I don't wanna love nobody but you
I don't wanna love nobody but you (yes)
I don't wanna love nobody, love nobody but you (I searched all over)
I don't wanna love nobody but you (you)
I don't wanna love nobody but you (that's right)
I don't wanna love nobody, love nobody but you (yes, and the church sang, come on)
Loving you will be (Jesus, loving you)
will be the death of me (It sounds crazy don't it)
That's how it's supposed to be (lemme tell you what it means)
More of you, less of me (that's why)
I don't wanna love nobody but you
I don't wanna love nobody but you (Father)
I don't wanna love nobody, love nobody but you (I really mean it this time)
I don't wanna love nobody but you (Jesus)
I don't wanna love nobody but you
I don't wanna love nobody, love nobody but you (lemme tell you what he does)
He saved the day (c'mon)
He will come through (He won't let you down)
He won't doubt, that's not what super heroes do (sing, "I will never find")
No greater (a love like this) love makes my heart beat (forever and a day)
All I wanna do is make you proud of me (let me say it again)
He saved the day
He will come through (it feels so good)
He won't doubt, that's not what super heroes do
No greater love (Hallelujah) makes my heart beat (for the rest of my life)
All I wanna do is make you proud of me (everybody sing)
I don't wanna love nobody but you
I don't wanna love nobody but you (you)
I don't wanna love nobody, love nobody but you (you're the Savior)
I don't wanna love nobody but you
I don't wanna love nobody but you (yes)
I don't wanna love nobody, love nobody but you
End
