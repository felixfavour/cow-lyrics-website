Ooh, ooh, ooh
You are at home in my heart
'Cause You loved me right from the start
When I was refusing (hey)
Your love kept pursuing
One, two, three, four
Now that I've tasted Your love
My heart just can't get enough
Jesus, You have me
You have me completely
It's Your love in my heart running over, yeah
Every day of my life, I'll draw closer (hey)
Such a perfect love
Oh, You lift me higher (higher)
Lighting up my way
Everything is brighter (brighter)
With You, everything is better (so much better)
With You, I am right where I belong
In this perfect love
No matter what I go through
Lord, I'll keep my eyes fixed on You
'Cause Jesus, You're faithful
And You are able
Oh, it's Your love in my heart running over, yeah
Every day of my life, I'm gonna draw closer to You
Such a perfect love
Oh, You lift me higher (higher)
Lighting up my way
Everything is brighter (brighter)
With You, everything is better (so much better)
With You, I am right where I belong
Now, every part of my heart is now open
Make Your home in my heart, You are welcome,
ooh, yeah
You are welcome
Oh, Jesus, You are welcome, yeah
Yeah Yeah
C'mon, c'mon
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Such a perfect love
Oh, You lift me higher (higher)
Lighting up my way
Everything is brighter (brighter, ooh, Lord)
With You, everything is better (so much better)
With You, I am right where I belong
In this perfect love
