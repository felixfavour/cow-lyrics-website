When I close my eyes and think of You
And reminisce on all the things You do
I can't imagine my life without You
It's like paradise, now I
Know that it's real
It's a mystery
For someone to give their life just for me
What you did on Calvary
Makes me wanna love You more
I never knew
I could be so happy
I never knew
I'd be so secure
Because of Your love
Life has brand new meaning
It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day
Never thought that I would smile again
I never thought the dark clouds would end
Never thought that I could have a friend
That would keep me
Never leave me alone
Jesus, You're my everything
The only one that makes my heart sing (heart sing)
Now I know what real love means
It's everlasting, lasting
