For Your Glory"
Lord if I
Find favor in Your sight
Lord please
Hear my hearts cry
I'm desperately waiting
To be where You are
I'll cross the hottest desert
I'll travel near or far
For Your glory
I will do anything
Just to see You
To behold You as my King
For Your glory
I will do anything
Just to see you
To behold You as my King
Lord if I
Find favor in Your sight
Lord please
Hear my hearts cry
I'm desperately waiting
To be where You are
I'll cross the hottest desert
I'll travel near or far
For Your glory
I will do anything
Just to see You
To behold You as my King
For Your glory
I will do anything
Just to see you
To behold You as my King
For Your glory
I will do anything
Just to see You
To behold You as my King
For Your glory
I will do anything
Just see you
And behold You as my King
For Your glory
I will do anything
Just to see You
To behold You as my King
I wanna be where You are
I gotta be where You are
I wanna be where You are
I gotta be where You are
I wanna be where You are
Gotta be where You are
I wanna be where You are
Gotta be where You are
For Your glory
I will do anything
Just to see You
To behold You as my King
I wanna be where You are
Peace is where You are
Joy is where You are
And Love is who You are
