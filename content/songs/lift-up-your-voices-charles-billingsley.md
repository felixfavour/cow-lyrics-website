Lift up your voices
With a shout of victory
Well, Jesus has triumphed
Over all our enemies
Put on the robe of righteousness
Lift up the shield of faith
Jesus has the victory
So rejoice in Him
Lift your voice in praise
Lift your voice in praise
He has triumphed over death
The gates of hell must fall
Rising up beyond the grave
He's reigning over all
Lift up your voices
With a shout of victory
Oh, Jesus has triumphed
Over all our enemies
Put on the robe of righteousness
Lift up the shield of faith
Jesus has the victory
So rejoice in Him
And lift your voice in praise
Lift your voice in praise
