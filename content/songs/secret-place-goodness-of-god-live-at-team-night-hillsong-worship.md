VERSE 1:
I remember the beginning
When I found the secret place
Don’t know why it felt familiar
But I knew it right away
There were times it seemed so simple
And sometimes so unsure
But not a moment was ever wasted
Knelt behind those closed doors
VERSE 2:
‘Cause the secret place is secret
That’s where it gets its name
It’s not hiding but it’s hidden
Far from all religious games
No it won’t bring recognition
Or get called up on a stage
‘Cause the melody is sacred
You sing in the secret place
VERSE 3:
It’s an open invitation
No words you have to say
If you want it you can get there
There’s a thousand different ways
There’s no glory in the method
None are right and none are wrong
You just put your trust in Jesus
And then start to sing along
