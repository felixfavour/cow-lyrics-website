Verse:
They told me dreams come true now
I've been chasing mine
I don't sleep now
But so far it didn't come around
So far it didn't come around
When everyday man
I've been working hard for the payment
So I don't understand how it works now
God please show me the way now yea
Cos I don tire
Daddy I don tire
Mummy I don tire
I can't wait no longer
I don tire
Daddy I don tire
Mummy I don tire
I can't wait no longer
Bridge:
So Oluwa change my story
Show me a brighter day ye
Take all my tears away ye
Take all these pains away ye
Oluwa change my story
Show me a brighter day ye
Take all my tears away ye
Take all these pains away ye
Oluwa change my story oh
Chorus
Ma je n wa aye lai sere o
(Don't let me come to this world without prospering )
Eledami mo fe se rere
(My creator I want to prosper)
Eledami mo fe se rere
Eledami mo fe se rere
(All x 2)
Da' T.R.U.T.H.:
This is my story Lord
This is my song
They say Go hard or go home
The moment I think I'm getting ahead it's like;
How many times can I take a loss? His
Stroke of the pen is so genius writing my script
A pity party I've been invited to quit
If anybody is getting tired of this
I've been
At the bottom but He provided the strength
It's like;
Ashes boy it's beauty from ashes
Born for adversity getting booed from the rafters
Power from the most high
Strength renewed from the Master
Hecklers on the sidelines
I refuse to go back wards
Confident to know that He got a plan for my life
Cutting through the darkness
I would rather stand in the light
I would never quit or give up
My stamina's tight
Raising up the standard
I gotta stay in the fight
I'm gone
Limoblaze:
But if I get a dose of that blessing
If I get rich and famous
I promise to treat everyone right
I'll never look down on a fellow man
That ain't right
But if I get a dose of that blessing
If I get rich and famous
I go still serve God oh
And I go bless more lives
Bridge:
So Oluwa change my story
Show me a brighter day ye
Take all my tears away ye
Take all these pains away ye
Oluwa change my story
Show me a brighter day ye
Take all my tears away ye
Take all these pains away ye
Oluwa change my story oh
Chorus
Ma je n wa aye lai sere o
(Don't let me come to this world without prospering )
Eledami mo fe se rere
(My creator I want to prosper)
Eledami mo fe se rere
Eledami mo fe se rere
