[Ahjah:]
This song is not for you, if you've never cried a river
Or had your heart broken in two
This song is not for you, if everyday you wake up
The skies are blue
[Rhea:]
But this is for anyone, no matter how you pray
The pain won't let you get through
But you try and you try
Still they lie, they say that it's over for you
[Chorus: All]
If you're a miracle today and God has always made a way
If you have food to eat, a place to sleep and you really can't complain
This song is for you
After everything you've been through
This song is for you
[Paco:]
This song is not for you, if you love judging others
But you make the same mistakes
This song is not for you, if you think your name is Jesus
And forget you're in need of grace
[Darrel:]
But this is for anybody who needs a little mercy
Just to make it through the day
Oh but they try and they try
Still they lie, oh oh they say that it's over for you
