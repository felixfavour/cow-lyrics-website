ti:08 Gratitude]
I have Jesus there's no fear
He lives at the side of me
I'm more than conquerors
Because my redeemer lives
No more worries for me
No pain no loss but gain
In his assurance I stand
I see my future brighter
Jesus the son of strength
I sing
No more worries for me
Egbo orin ayo lenu mi
In his assurance I stand
Oniile ara oti tun mi se
Jesus the song of strength
I sing
Jesus the song of strength
I sing
He brought me out of merry clay
Set my feet on the solid rock
Songs of praise shall never seize
Lenu mi o titi lai
Holy ghost songs of power
I sing
Holy ghost songs of power
I sing
Holy ghost songs of power
I sing
Holy ghost songs of power
I sing
I have been far away
In his hands he brought me home
Close my heart locked all the doors
He kept knocking till I opened
Now I'm redeemed of the lord
Ewo mi o
Jesus the song of salvation
I sing
No more worries for me
Egbo orin ayo lenu mi
In his assurance I stand
Onise ara so mi dotun
No more worries for me
Egbo orin ayo lenu mi
In his assurance I stand
Onise ara so mi dotun
Jesus the song of strength
I sing
Jesus the song of strength
I sing
Ewa bami yo mo se ori re
Igbala mi dotun
Hallelujah
Kosi iberu mo
By the blood of the lamb
Ati segun fun mi
Ewa bami yo
Ati segun fun mi
Ewa bami yo
Mo se ori re
Igbala mi dotun
Hallelujah
Kosi iberu mo
By the blood of the lamb
Ati segun fun mi
No matter what I've been through
Christ set me free free indeed
I've heard the song of victory
I sing
Rescued not captive of them
Gods inheritance of heaven
My life filled with testimonies
His love over shadows me
All my fear already gone
