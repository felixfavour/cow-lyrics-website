You promise salvation
To bring your children home
You promise redemption
Your love was restored
We can see you all around
We can see you all around
This is the day
This is the time
When all is going
To come alive
We seen you move
We've seen you fight
we've seen it all cause you are on our side
You promise the city
Will be shaking with your love
You promise your spirit
To change the world throughout
We can see you all around
We can see you all around
This is the the day
This is the time
When all is going to come alive
We've seen you move
We've see you fight
We've seen it all cause you're on our side
For your glory
Your fame Lord
We surrender
Our lives
For your glory
Your fame Lord
We surrender our lives
We can see you all around
We can see you all around
This is the day
This is the time
When all is going
To come alive
We have seen you move
We've seen you fight
We've seen it all cause you are on our side
This is the day
This is the time
When all this is going
To come alive
We have seen you move
We've seen you fight
We've seen it all cause you are on our side
