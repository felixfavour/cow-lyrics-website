He's calling you
He's calling you
Tell me what are you going to do?
Your time has come for a life brand new
He is calling you
He is calling you....
There's a voice deep inside
You hear it and you cannot hide
Seems like after all you've tried
You never satisfied
You softly heard Him call and say
Ooo..
You promised that you'd change someday
Even if you run away, you still can't deny
Ooo..
Something's going on and it's real
Oooo..
Somehow deep inside you can feel.. Ooo..
He's calling you
He's calling you
Yes He is..
Tell me what are you going to do?
For your time has come for a life brand new
He is calling you...
He is calling you...
Remember when you said before
Ooo..
That you needed something more
Ooo..
Now it's time to realize
He's knocking at your door
Oooo...
Things that you used to do
Ooo...
Somehow don't appeal to you
Why would you deny that you don't want them anymore
Oooo...
Listen to your heart and to your soul
Listen child
Ooo...
And don't be afraid anymore...
He's calling you
He's calling you
Tell me what are you going to do?
Your time has come for life brand new
He is call...
Calling you...
He is call...
Calling you...

He's calling you
Tell me what are you going to do?
Your time has come for a life brand new
