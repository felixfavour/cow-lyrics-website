(Ty Bello)
Oh oh oh, we marvel
We are in awe, we are in awe
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, we marvel
We are in awe
What a joy to see you
Oh oh, unveiled, heart to heart
There is nothing between us now
Oh oh oh, we're face to face
What a joy to see you
Oh oh, unveiled, heart to heart
There is nothing between us now
Oh oh oh, we're face to face
There is no veil
There is no distance
There is no veil
There is no distance
There is no veil
There is no distance
There is no veil
There is no distance
Oh oh oh oh, what a joy to see you
Eh eh eh, Jehovah, we love that you are in this place today
To be face to face
Worshiping unveiled, heart to heart
Eh eh eh, what a joy to see you (ah ah ah)
Worship unveiled, heart to heart (ah ah ah)
There is nothing between us now (ah ah ah)
We're face to face (ah ah ah)
We love that you are here God (ah ah ah)
We worship face to face (ah ah ah)
Eh eh eh, there is nothing between us now (ah ah ah)
We worship heart to heart (ah ah ah)
Eh eh eh eh eh, there is no veil (there is no veil)
There is no distance
There is no veil
There is no distance
There is no veil
There is no distance...
Oh oh oh, we marvel
We are in awe, we are in awe
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, we marvel
We are in awe
There is nothing between us now
We've come to worship heart to heart
