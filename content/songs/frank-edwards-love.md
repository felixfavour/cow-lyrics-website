Verse 1]
Love is the Answer
Everyone is Looking for
God is the Answer
Jesus is the only Way
Papa, I've searched all around
Around the World
And no one like you, no one like you
Your Love, Saturates all around
Around the World with no Exception

No One Loves like you do
The Cross is a Prove of your Love
No One Loves like you do
The grave is a Prove of your Love
No One Loves like you do
Death is a Prove of your Love
No One Loves like you do
You Rose again 'cause you Love me
{ Love eh, Love O,
Love eh, Love O
Love eh, Love O } [x2]
Love (Lyrics)  by Frank Edwards
Too many People
Don't know what it means to Love
The Fighting, the Cheating
The Judging, the Murder
The Hating, they Shatter, they Loot,
Condemn, they dupe, they lie,
They don't Forgive
They say Life is a Jungle
I just wanna Love like you do
Live my Life, like you did
I just wanna Change the World
Just like You
The Cross wasn't Easy
But you carried it
No it wasn't easy, But you took it like

No One Loves like you do
The Cross is a Prove of your Love
No One Loves like you do
The grave is a Prove of your Love
No One Loves like you do
Death is a Prove of your Love
No One Loves like you do
You Rose again 'cause you Love me
{ Love eh, Love O,
Love eh, Love O
Love eh, Love O } [x4
