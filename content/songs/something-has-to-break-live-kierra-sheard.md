I feel it in this room
Holy Spirit move
'Cause when You have Your way
Something has to break
Tear down every lie
Set the wrong thing right
'Cause when you have Your way
Something has to break
Something has to break
[Pre-Chorus]
Right now in Your name
Something has to break
Something has to break
Right now in Your name
Something has to break
[Chorus: Kierra Sheard & Tasha Cobbs-Leonard]
I believe You'll get me to it
I believe You'll lead me through it
I believe that You will do it right now
Something has to break
I believe You'll lead me through it
I believe You'll get me to it
I believe that You will do it right now
Something has to break
