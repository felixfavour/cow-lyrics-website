Who breaks the power of sin and darkness?
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger?
The King of Glory, the King above all kings
Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder?
And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder?
The King of Glory, the King above all kings
[Phil Wickham (Lecrae):]
This is amazing grace (Yeah, yeah)
This is unfailing love (Yeah, yeah)
That You would take my place (Oh yeah, take my place, take my place)
That You would bear my cross (Uh, bear my cross, bear my cross)
You lay down Your life (Yeah, You lay down)
That I would be set free (Set free, free, set free, set free)
Oh, Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done for me
[Lecrae:]
Yeah
The grace so amazing (Woo)
That's why I praise Him
They don't know where we done came from (came from)
On my momma, they can't harm us, got my arms up
Boy, we covered in that armor
And we done made it
Y'all ain't hear me? Boy, we made it (we made it!)
I ain't earned it, but I'll take it
Got that light inside of me that you don't need no eyes to see and you can feel it, you can hear it when I say
(Hey! Hey!)
[Phil Wickham (Lecrae):]
This is amazing grace (Yeah, yeah)
This is unfailing love (Yeah, yeah)
That You would take my place (Oh yeah, take my place, take my place)
That You would bear my cross (Uh, bear my cross, bear my cross)
You lay down Your life (Yeah, You lay down)
That I would be set free (Set free, free, set free, set free)
Oh, Jesus, I sing for
All that You've done for me
