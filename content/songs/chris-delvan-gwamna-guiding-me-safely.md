I know the way He walks
I've seen the path He trodes
Cos His Spirit is all over me
Guiding me safely in the way
I am the apple of His eyes
I am the joy that's in His heart
I am the smile that splits His face
And He's guiding me safely in the way
I know the way You walk
I know the path you trode
Your Spirit is all over me
And You're guiding me safely in the way
I am the apple of Your eyes
I am the tree You bear around
My life is engraved upon the palm of Your hand And You're guiding me safely in the way
And You're guiding me safely in the way
Guiding me safely in the way
I am the star that's in His sky
I am the dream He's matching to
I am the twinkle of the crown on His head
He's guiding me safely in the way
Yes He's knows the way I walk
He sees the path I trode
Cos His Spirit is all over me
And He's guiding me safely in the way
He's guiding me safely in the way
Guiding me safely in the way
Guiding me safely
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Guiding me safely in the way
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Guiding me safely in the way
The snare of the fowler is broken my soul has escaped
Guiding me safely in the way
You've given me a sound of rejoicing all day long
Guiding me safely in the way
In the name of the Lord I rejoice forever
Guiding me safely in the way
