And you will see the goodness
You will see the goodness of the Lord
You will see the goodness
You will see the goodness of the Lord
While you live
You've waited patiently
And wondered when will it be
He may not come when you want Him
But He's always on time
And you will see the goodness
Make your declaration in this room
You will see the goodness of the Lord
While you live (While you live)
Donnie McClurkin
You cried and you prayed
(You cried and you prayed) my God
Prayed and cried (Prayed and cried)
And it seems as if it wasn't enough
He's always there
He's always right there
Right there
Right there to rescue you
And you will see the goodness
And you will see the goodness of the Lord
You will see the goodness, you will see
You will see the goodness of the Lord, goodness of the Lord
While you live
Just live
You're gonna live until you see it
Everybody say
Live, just live
You're gonna live, yeah
