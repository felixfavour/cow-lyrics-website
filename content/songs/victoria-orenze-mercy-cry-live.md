Victoria Orenze Mercy Cry Lyrics
Generous in love god
Huge in mercy
Loving father
Before you now we come
We've been out of step for so long
In the wrong since we were born
Wipe away our records
Start afresh with us
Oh lord
Your mercy is all we ask for 2ce
We ask for mercy
Mercy
We need your mercy
Mercy
We cry for mercy
Mercy
Release your mercy
Mercy
