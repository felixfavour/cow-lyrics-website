Have you heard
Death has been conquered
The night is gone
The morning has come
Every fear
Has been stripped of its power
Jesus Christ, Lord of life
You’ve already won
From a throne in heaven to a sinner’s cross
You bought our freedom with Your outstretched arms
We praise the Savior of the world
Jesus is alive the stone was rolled away
Our hope is built upon an empty grave
We praise the Savior of the world
Come and see
There is hopе from the ashes
The risеn king
Will break every chain
Lift your voice
And shout hallelujah
All the glory and honor
Forever to His name
To His name
