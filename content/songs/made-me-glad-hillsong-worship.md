I will bless the Lord forever
And I will trust Him at all times
He has delivered me from all sin
And He has set my feet upon a rock
[Pre-Chorus]
And I will not be moved
And I'll say of the Lord
You are my shield, my strength
My portion, Deliverer
My shelter, strong tower
My very present help in time of need
Whom have I in Heaven but You?
There's none I desire beside You
[Pre-Chorus]
You have made me glad
And I'll say of the Lord
You are my shield, my strength
My portion, Deliverer
My shelter, strong tower
My very present help
You are my shield, my strength
My portion, Deliverer
My shelter, strong tower
My very present help in time of need
