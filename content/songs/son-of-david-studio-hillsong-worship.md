Heal us and restore us
Lord, hear our cry and pour out grace
Justice, flow like rivers
Come flood our land and bring us peace
Jesus, Son of David
Have mercy, Have mercy on us
Comfort all who suffer
Come bless the poor and those in need
Freedom for the nations
Lord, may we see oppression cease
Jesus, Son of David
Have mercy, have mercy
Holy God, forgive us
Have mercy, have mercy on us
[Post-Chorus]
Lord Jesus
[Bridge]
When we fail, forgive us
When we hurt, heal us
Lord, you won't forsake us now
Turn your ear toward us
Turn brokenness to praises
Here on earth, let Heaven come
When we fail, forgive us
When we hurt, heal us
Lord, you won't forsake us now
Turn your ear toward us
Turn brokenness to praises
Here on earth, let Heaven come
