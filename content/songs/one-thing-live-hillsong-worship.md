I tasted the world
Seen more than enough
Its promises fleeting
Of water and wine I emptied the cup
And found myself wanting
But there is a well that never runs dry
The water of life, the blood of the vine
Cause all I know is
Everything I have means nothing
Jesus if you're not my one thing
Everything I need right now
All I need is You right now
Just one thing I ask and this I will seek
If only to know you
To be where you are and go where you lead
My God I will follow
The things of this world I've counted as loss
I lay it all down to take up this cross
Cause all I want is
Everything You are and nothing
Jesus if You're not my one thing
Everything to me right now
