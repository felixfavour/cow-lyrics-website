Anoint my head, anoint my feet
Send your Angels raining down
Here on the battle ground
For your Glory, we're taking territory
Fighting unseen enemies
Like never before
We're waging war.
Anoint my head ( Oh yeah)
Anoint my feet ( send them raining down)
Send your Angels raining down
Here on the battle ground ( For your glory)
For your Glory, ( we're taking)
We're taking territory
Fighting unseen enemies ( like never before)
Like never before
We're waging war
I'm tired of principalities
messing with me ( waging war)
I'm tired of the devil stealing from me (waging war)
I promise he won't get one more thing (waging war)
I'm taking it back, taking territory (waging war)
I'm ready for the battle, I'm ready to win (waging war)
My weapon of power, He lives with me ( waging war)
I can't be defeated, the enemies gotta flee ( waging war)
I'm taking it back, taking territory
Going into battle (going into battle)
Going into battle ( going into battle)
Going into battle (going into battle)
Be my Sword
Be my Shield
As we claim the victory
Over the enemy (humm)
In your name
You rule and reign
Never been defeated anymore
We're waging war
Be my Sword
Be my Shield
As we claim the victory ( over the enemy)
Over the enemy (in your name)
In your name (You rule and reign)
You rule and reign
Never been defeated anymore
We're waging war
I'm tired of principalities
messing with me ( waging war)
