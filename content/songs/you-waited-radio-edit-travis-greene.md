You called out my name
Knew my past, covered my shame
This amazing grace
You've shown, so patiently
You've shown, so patiently
And You
You waited
For me, just for me
You waited
For me, just for me
[Pre-Chorus]
Where would I be
If You left me, God?
Where would I be
If You left me, God?
Where would I be
If You left me, God?
Where would I be
If You left me, God?
But You waited, waited
You waited, waited
You waited, waited
You waited, waited
