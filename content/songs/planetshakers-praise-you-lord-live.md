"Praise You Lord"
-Endless Praise (Live)-
Woah, the King broke chains off me
Your love has set me free
Now all I can do is dance
Woah, the walls came crashing down
With one word from Your mouth
Now all I can do is dance
We are redeemed, set free forgiven
We are the chosen, we are the living
We are redeemed, set free forgiven
So if you love Him, sing, sing!
Oh! Praise You Lord, I'll praise You Lord
For You are good, You are good
Forever we will dance and sing
For You are good, You are good
You are good
Woah, Your love has rescued me
I live in victory
Now all I can do is dance
We are redeemed, set free forgiven
We are the chosen, we are the living
We are redeemed, set free forgiven
So if you love Him, sing, sing!
Oh! Praise You Lord, I'll praise You Lord
For You are good, You are good
Forever we will dance and sing
For You are good, You are good
Praise You Lord, I'll praise You Lord
For You are good, You are good
Forever we will dance and sing
For You are good, You are good
You are good
Whom the Son sets free is free indeed
Whom the Son sets free has liberty
Your love has taken chains off me
Whom the Son sets free is free indeed
Whom the Son sets free has liberty
Your love has taken chains off me
Whom the Son sets free is free indeed
Whom the Son sets free has liberty
Your love has taken chains off me
Oh! Praise You Lord, I'll praise You Lord
For You are good, You are good
Forever we will dance and sing
For You are good, You are good
Praise You Lord, I'll praise You Lord
For You are good, You are good
Forever we will dance and sing
For You are good, You are good
You are good
You are good
