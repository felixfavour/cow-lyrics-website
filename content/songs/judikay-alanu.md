Your mercies are new every morning
This is everlasting
This is never ending
Your convenant is sure
Your kingdom has no end
This is everlasting

Oba alanu
Olorun iyanu
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
From cradle days I have never seen you forsake your beloved
It is not what you do
Now I am older
I barely see that
Ohh
Your banner over me is love
This is just who you are o
Oba alanu
Olorun iyanu
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
Oba alanu
Olorun iyanu
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
You are word made flesh
Manifest in our presence
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
One that bore my iniquities
Cross of calvary paid for my sins
Nigbogbo ono eshe o
Oba alanu
Olorun iyanu
Nigbogbo ono eshe o

Nigbogbo ono eshe o
Oba alanu (Compassionate & merciful)
Kind of loving, that's who you are
Oba alanu
See how you made my life so beautiful
See how you adorn me with your glory
Merciful king o
You paid the debt you did not owe
My Jesus
Oba alanu
