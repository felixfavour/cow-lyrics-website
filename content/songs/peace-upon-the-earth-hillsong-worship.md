His star shines above us
To lead toward the Saviour
A baby born in Bethlehem
Our Emmanuel
The Son in a manger
Shall heal the blind and broken
His love shall warm the coldest soul
As the snow is melted by the dawn
'Neath the stars choirs of angels
Raise their heavenly voices
Glory to God and
Peace upon the earth
For all who believe Him
Shall gain life everlasting
His kingdom endures eternal
Christ forever will reign
'Neath the stars choirs of angels
Raise their heavenly voices
Glory to God and
Peace upon the earth
