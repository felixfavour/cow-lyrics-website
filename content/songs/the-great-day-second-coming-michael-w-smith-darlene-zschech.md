[Instrumental]
We met pain in a garden where we lived a lie
We met hope in a manger and a babyâ€™s cry
Rescued by hands bleeding grace
Are we ready to see His face?
On the great day
He will come to claim us with a rushing wind
Blown like fields of wheat, the world will bow and bend
Held between our joy and disbelief
Every trembling heart will finally face the same way
On the great day
One day Love will wear the crown
One day Love will set us free
Hands up high and faces down
Angels teaching us to sing
He will be King
He will be King
He who scattered us on every distant shore
He will gather us unto Himself once more
Let the story of our footprints tell
We were walking well, holding high Your name
Until the great day
