There's a rose in the desert
Blooming red in the drought
There's a quenching rain
In the wings of the gathering clouds
Lift your eyes
Look to the horizon now
There's still a hope for us
Reach up from the dust
And call it down
Can you hear
Can you hear that thunder
Sing His name, sing it out
'Til the sky spills over
I may just be dry bones
Stripped of sinew and skin
But the wind of His spirit
Will raise me up again
I lift my eyes
I look to the horizon now
Oh, there's still a song to sing
Fall down on your knees and cry aloud
