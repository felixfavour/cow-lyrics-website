1 CHRISTIANS, awake! salute the happy morn,
Whereon the Saviour of mankind was born;
Rise to adore the mystery of love
Which hosts of angels chanted from above:
With them the joyful tidings first begun
Of God incarnate, of the virgin’s Son.

2 Then to the watchful shepherds it was told,
Who heard the angelic herald’s voice, ‘Behold,
I bring good tidings of a Saviour’s birth
To you and all the nations upon earth:
This day has God fulfilled His promised word,
This day is born a Saviour, Christ the Lord.’

3 He spake; and straightway the celestial choir,
In hymns of joy unknown before conspire;
The praises of redeeming love they sang,
And heaven’s whole orb with hallelujahs rang:
God’s highest glory was their anthem still,
‘Peace upon earth, and unto men good will.’

4 O may we keep and ponder in our mind
God’s wondrous love in saving lost mankind;
Trace we the Babe Who has retrieved our loss,
From the poor manger to the bitter cross;
Tread in His steps, assisted by His grace,
Till man’s first heavenly state again takes place.

5 Then may we hope, the angelic hosts among,
To join, redeemed, a glad triumphant throng:
He that was born upon this joyful day,
Around us all His glory shall display;
Saved by His love, incessant we shall sing
Eternal praise to Heaven’s almighty King.
