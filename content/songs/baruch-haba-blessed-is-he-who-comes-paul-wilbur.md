Baruch haba b'Shem Adonai
Blessed is He who comes
Baruch haba b'Shem Adonai
Who comes in the name of the Lord

Now arise O Lord
Come to Your resting place
You and the ark of Your might
Then we will rejoice
As we're cloth with Your righteousness
And celebrate the love

Baruch haba b'Shem Adonai
Blessed is He who comes
Baruch haba b'Shem Adonai
Who comes in the name of the Lord, of the Lord!

Baruch haba b'Shem Adonai
Blessed is He who comes
Baruch haba b'Shem Adonai
Who comes in the name of the Lord
