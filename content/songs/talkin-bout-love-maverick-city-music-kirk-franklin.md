[Intro: Kirk Franklin, 
Chandler Moore
]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can we talk about love, y'all? (
Love, y'all
)
Yeah, yeah, say (
Love, y'all
)
Can we talk about love, y'all? (
Love, y'all
)
Let's go
I've never had anything as good as You
And I don't think I ever will, no, no, no
They tell me that real love's too good to be true
But I ain't living in a fairytale, no, oh
[Pre-Chorus: Chandler Moore & Lizzie Morgan]
'Cause if you had it, then you know it
[Chorus: Chandler Moore, Lizzie Morgan & Mav City Gospel Choir]
What I'm talkin' 'bout is love, ayy (Love)
Have you ever felt it?
The one that comes from above (Above)
Ain't nothin' like it
(See, I've tried) I've tried other loves before
But this love that I'm talkin' 'bout (Talkin' 'bout)
It's a real love, it's sure
What I'm talkin' 'bout is love (Hey!)
Yeah, what I'm talkin' 'bout is love
