nnah make you no cry again
because you no get pikin

Sarah i can hear the mocking and the laughter
but make you understand say in the morning after
e go be your turn to laugh
make i tell you something for sure

God will hear your heart cry
and e go bring the answer to you just in time
no worry my brother things go better in the end my sister
afterrain na sun go shine
make you no cry God no dey lie
he will see you through just put your hope in Jesus Christ
Jephtah i know you've been rejected
ostrasized neglected

Joseph upon all wetin you do

till your hopes and dreams have been realized
and He go make your future bright
no worry my brother things go better in the end my sister

Naomi i know you lost your sons and
