ir they've all gone off to him"
I said to that baptizer
We sat and watched his friends
Leave him in the dust
"It's a cold world
And we all just need the son"
He said with a smile
I chose Altars over stages
Cause heaven is my wages
I don't need the spotlight
So make me a silhouette
I won't fret
I don't care
You can take me anywhere
Heaven is my wages
I chose
Altars over stages
Even angels in the sky
Can fall down to the depths
Clip their wings with their pride
And rot whats in their chest
The funny thing about pride
Is that you have it all your life
But the moment you think you dont
Its gotten in your eyes
Has it gotten in my eyes?
I chose Altars over stages
Cause heaven is my wages
I don't need the spotlight
So make me a silhouette
I won't fret
I don't care
You can take me anywhere
Heaven is my wages
I chose
Altars over stages
I chose Altars over stages
Cause heaven is my wages
I don't need the spotlight
So make me a silhouette
I won't fret
I don't care
You can take me anywhere
Heaven is my wages
I chose
Altars over stages
