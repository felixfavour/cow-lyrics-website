Undenied, unfailing
Undefeated, unchanging
All in all, victorious
It's the love of Jesus
Undenied, unfailing
Undefeated, unchanging
All in all, victorious
Is the love of Jesus
[Pre-Chorus]
For You took the cross
When all hope had been lost
And no power could stand in the way
Of Your love, Your love
Higher than the heavens
Stronger than a thousand seas
Your love, Your love
Constant through the seasons
Closer than the air I breathe
Unrestrained, unrivaled
Unashamed, unbridled
All in all, invincible
God, Your love can never fail
