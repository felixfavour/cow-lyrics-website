The sky shall unfold preparing His entrance
The stars shall applaud Him
With thunders of praise
The sweet light in His eyes shall
Shall enhance those awaiting
And we shall behold Him, then face to face
We shall behold Him (2x's)
Face to face
In all of His glory
We shall behold Him (2x's)
Face to face, our Savior and Lord
The angels will sound the shouts of His coming
The sleeping shall rise
From their slumbering place
And those who remain
Shall be changed in a moment
We shall behold Him, our Savior and Lord
We shall behold Him (2x's)
Face to face
In all of His glory
We shall behold Him (2x's)
Face to face, our Savior and Lord
