Hear our prayer
We are Your children
And we've gathered here today
We're gathered here to pray
Hear our cry
Lord, we need Your mercy
And we need Your grace today
Hear us as we pray
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Our Father, hear us from Heaven
Forgive our sins we pray
Hear our song
As it rises to Heaven
May Your glory fill the earth
As the waters cover the seas
See our hearts
And remove anything
That is standing in the way
Of coming to You today
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Our Father, hear us from Heaven
Forgive our sins we pray
And though we are few
We're surrounded by many
Who have crossed that river before
And this is the song we'll be singing forever
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Hear our prayer
We are Your children
And we've gathered here today
We're gathered here to pray
Hear our cry
Oh Lord, we need Your mercy
And we need Your grace today, yes, we do
Hear us as we pray
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Our Father, hear us from Heaven
Forgive our sins we pray
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Our Father, hear us from Heaven
Forgive our sins we pray
Forgive our sins we pray
Forgive our sins we pray
Oh yeah
