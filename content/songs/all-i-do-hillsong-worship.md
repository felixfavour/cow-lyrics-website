I wanted to find (Where I was going)
Everything I tried (It took me nowhere)
I was so tired of just living my life, waiting for a sign
You came to my side (Gave me direction)
Strong on the inside (I shine for You, Lord)
Now it's my time, I have made up my mind
To be all You want for me
All I do is live my life for You
I know it's true, I'll never let You go
All I do, I'd do anything for You
Everything is in Your hands
So I get up, get up and praise You
