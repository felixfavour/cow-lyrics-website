You betrayed me with a kiss
Love was never meant for this
You broke my heart and crushed my soul
Left me trembling in the cold
You betrayed me with a kiss
But I'll keep on living
I'll learn to love again
And I'll keep on healing
And pray this pain will end
You betrayed with a kiss
Was it really worth the risk
You traded the silver for your gold
Thirty pieces you were sold
You betrayed me with a kiss
But I'll keep on living
And I'll learn to love again
And I'll keep forgiving
And hate will never win
