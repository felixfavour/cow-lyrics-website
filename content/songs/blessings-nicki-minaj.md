[Intro]
Blessings, blessings, oh, blessings
I'm blessed, blessed, blessed
Woo
(
Sad Pony

 Blessed, blessed, blessed 
(

)
There's a river that I go to and it heals me
Recently became a mama and it thrills me
Even when the water's rocky and it chills me
When he tells me to be still, somehow it stills me
[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Blessed, blessed, blessеd
Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ooh-ooh
Blessed, blessеd, blessed
Blessings, blessings, oh, blessings
I'm blessed, blessed, blessed
Blessings, blessings, oh, blessings
I'm blessed, blessed, blessed
I know I can really say I'm truly proud of you
And no matter what they say, I never doubted you
I completely understand what you gotta do
Do what you gotta do
There's a river that I go to and it heals me
My cup runneth over, it ain't ever empty
Mm, when I'm gettin' my own, I still have plenty
Stop beatin' up on yourself, handle it gently
