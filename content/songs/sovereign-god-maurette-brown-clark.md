There aren't even words to describe just how great you are
In all your majesty, you continually provide for me
There just isn't anything that you can't do
Lord, I've seen your work before
So, I'll trust you all the more
Because you are

You are the sovereign God 
Bigger than all my problems 
And every situation 
There is nothing too hard
For the sovereign God

A wave of your hand can command the seas to hold their peace
If you can handle the seas
Then I know that you can deal with all my needs
So, I will put every situation into your capable hands
I don't have to know the plan
Because you are

He is able to do exceedingly abundantly
(All above we ask or think)
So, take all your burdens and lay them at his feet
And watch him meet the need
We have the victory
Because you are
