Tazama! Nimepewa nguvu, mamlaka
(Behold! I have been given the power, authority)
Ya kukanyaga nguvu za giza
(To trample on the powers of darkness)
Tena, nimejazwa na Roho Mtakatifu
(Also, I have been filled by the Holy Spirit)
Nimo ndani yake, Yesu ndani yangu
(I am in Him, Jesus is in me)

Walio upande wangu (Those who are with me)
Ndio wengi kuliko maadui (Are more numerous than my enemies)

Siwezi shindwa, siwezi zimia (I cannot be defeated, I will not faint) (Repeat)

Nimepakwa mafuta mabichi (I have been anointed with fresh oil)
Pembe yangu umeiinua (My horn, you have exalted)
Ndio maana, nina uhakika (That is why I have assurance)
Nitashinda, mimi nimshindi (I shall win, I am an overcomer) (Repeat)

(From the Top)


Nitashinda, mimi nimshindi (I shall win, I am an overcomer) x?

Tazama! Umepewa nguvu, mamlaka
(Behold! You have been given the power, authority)
Ya kukanyaga nguvu za giza
(To trample on the powers of darkness)
Tena, umejazwa na Roho Mtakatifu
(Also, You have been filled by the Holy Spirit)
Yuko ndani yako, Yesu ndani yako
(You are am in Him, Jesus is in you)

Walio upande wako (Those who are with you)
Ndio wengi kuliko maadui (Are more numerous than your enemies)
Huwezi shindwa, huwezi zimia (You cannot be defeated, I will not faint) (Repeat)
