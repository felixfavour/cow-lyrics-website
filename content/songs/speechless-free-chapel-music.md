Unending, but always on time
Unfailing, but never unkind
Unmerited favor is mine
Undeserving, oh but I receive
Your grace, Lord Your grace
Oh I need it, I receive it
I'm amazed, so amazed
When I see it I am speechless
You take my breath away
You take my breath away
And You breathe life into me
I'm nothing without You
Without grace, where would I be?
Nowhere without You
