For all you've done for Me
I will give Thanks to You
Gave me the Victory
I will give Thanks to You
Gave my Life a Meaning
Take me from Glory to Glory
For all you've done for Me
I will give Thanks to You

Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle
Jesus you have done it Again
Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle
Jesus you have done it Again
Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle
Jesus you have done it Again
Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle
Jesus you have done it Again
Your Love has Lifted Me
And I will give Thanks to You
Gave me a Song to Sing
Yes, I will give Thanks to You
Gave my Life a Meaning
You Take me from Glory to Glory
For all you've done for Me
Yes, I will give Thanks to You

Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle
Jesus you have done it Again
Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle
Jesus you have done it Again
Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle
Jesus you have done it Again
Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle
