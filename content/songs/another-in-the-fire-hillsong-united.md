There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone
There was another in the fire, standing next to me
There was another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding, of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden, where another died for me
There is another in the fire
All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way, I won't bow to the things of this world
And I know I will never be alone
There is another in the fire, standing next to me
There is another in the waters, holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding what power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body and now that power lives in me
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
There is another in the fire
(There is another, there is another, there is another in the fire)
