Aaaaaaah
Aaaaaaah
We welcome you
We welcome you
I welcome you
I need your presence
I want to see you
I long for you
Oh God
I hunger for you
I need your presence
I need you much more than before
Oh God
I make room for you, I shift
I make room for you, I move
I get out of the way
Let all else be gone
I make room for you I shift
I get out of the way
Take your place be God
I welcome you
Fill me with Your power
I want to see you
I welcome you
To my situation
There are certain things that only you can do and I realize it
I need your presence
I need you much more than before
I make room for you, I shift
I make room for you, I move
I get out of the way
Let all else be gone
I make room for you I shift
I make room for you, I move
I get out of the way
Take your place be God
Come and do the impossible
Jehovah Eh oh
Come and do the impossible
Once again, come and do
Chant
Come and do the impossible
Come and do the impossible
Jehovah Eeeeh
Come and do the impossible
(Chant)
Oh God
Eeeeeeh
We welcome you
