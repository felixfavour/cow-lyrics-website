Sovereign Hands
Nailed to a humble cross
Scars You bear
Speak of Your redeeming Love
[Pre-Chorus]
No wonder I call You the Savior
No wonder I'm singing
God of all the heavens
Now and 'til forever
High above the universe
God of our redemption
God of my surrender
The glory is Yours
Sovereign God
Laying down a holy Life
Heaven's Son
Willing to be crucified
[Pre-Chorus]
