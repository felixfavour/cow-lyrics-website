Sweet Jesus
You're the wind beneath my wings
Sweet Jesus
You're my melody and harmony
Sweet Jesus
You're the eyes that I see through
Sweet Jesus
Yes, I'm dancing to your tune
For as the dear pants for water so
My soul longs for You
Forever and ever, yes
My heart beats for You
As the deer pants for water so
My soul longs for You
Forever and ever, yes
My heart beats for You
Something more than gold
I've got something more than gold
Something more than gold
I've got something more than gold
If all I've got is Jesus
I've got something more than gold
I'll tell it to the world
Jesus is more than gold
More than gold, more than gold
I've got something more than gold
I'll tell it to the world
Jesus is more than gold
More than gold, more than gold
I've got something more than gold
I'll tell it to the world
Jesus is more than gold
It's such an honor that You called me Your own
Your love is unchangeable
Keeps coming after me
Shepherd of my heart
I love how You love me, yeah
Treasure of my soul
I stand in awe of You
As the deer pants for water so
My soul longs for You
Forever and ever, yes
My heart beats for You
As the deer pants for water so
My soul longs for You, Jesus
Forever and ever, yes
My heart beats for You
Something more than gold
I've got something more than silver
Something more than life
I've got something more than riches
If all I've got is Jesus
I've got something more than gold, ay
I'll tell it to the world
Jesus is more than gold
More than gold, more than gold
I've got something more than gold
More than gold, more than gold
Jesus is more than gold
Ah-ah
Something more than gold
Something more than silver
The spirit of the Lord within me
Is something more than gold
Something more than gold
Something more than silver
The spirit of the Lord within me
Is something more than gold
More than gold, more than gold
I've got something more than gold
Tell it to the world
Jesus is more than gold
More than gold, more than gold
I've got something more than gold
My brother, my sister
Jesus is more than gold
More than riches
You are everything to me
Oh, God, more than life
Jesus is more than gold
Oh Lord a hand because
Lord be the God in the highest
