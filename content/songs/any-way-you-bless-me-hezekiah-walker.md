Anyway You bless me
I'll be satisfied
You can wipe the tears from my eyes
And put joy inside
Anyway You bless me
I won't complain
The power of Your spirit said
It would ease the pain
Anyway, Anyway
I'll be satisfied
(He) Blessed my going out
And my coming in
Put Your spirit round about
And Your (great) joy within
Anyway, Anyway I'll be satisfied
Anyway, Anyway You bless me
Anyway, Anyway I'll be satisfied
Say anyway
Anyway
You Bless Me
Anyway You bless Me
