Come and fill our homes With Your presence
You alone are worthy of our reverence
As for me and my house
We will serve the Lord
As for me and my house
We will serve the Lord
As for me and my house
We will serve the Lord
We will serve the Lord
Lord, we vow to live holy
Bowing our knees to You only
As for me and my house
We will serve the Lord
As for me and my housе
We will serve thе Lord
As for me and my house
We will serve the Lord
We will serve the Lord
Staying together, praying together
Any storm we can weather
Trusting in God's Word
We need each other
Fathers and mothers
Sisters and brothers
In harmony and love
