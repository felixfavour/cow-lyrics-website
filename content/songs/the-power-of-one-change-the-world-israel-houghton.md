What if it all depended on me
To change the world, to change the world?
What if my only responsibility was
To change the world, change the world?
Let me be the one to start a revolution
Let me sing my song to the people of the world
It all begins with one, the power of one
Joining the hundreds of millions of people believing
In one, the power of one
Don't hang around, stand up or sit down and believe
We can change the world together
We can change the world together
What kind of love can conquer disease?
And change the world, change the world?
What I can do to make poverty history
And change the world, change the world?
Let me be the one to start a revolution
Let me sing my song to the people of the world
To the children of the world
It all begins with one, the power of one
Joining the hundreds of millions of people believing
In one, the power of one
Don't hang around, stand up or sit down and believe
