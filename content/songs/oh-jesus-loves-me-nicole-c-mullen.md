In the morning when I wake
Can't wait to face the day
'Cause I know You'll be with me
Gonna let Your light shine through
I dedicate this day to You
I dedicate this day to You
(Jesus loves me, this I know)
Jesus loves me, this I know
For the Bible tells me so
(Oh, the Bible tells me so)
For the Bible tells me so
Jesus loves me, this I know
If you're tired of the way
Satan's tryin' to ruin your day
Look up
(Jesus cares enough to fight)
Fight the dеvil by your side
Make him want to run and hide
(Makе him run and hide)
Where you runnin', devil?
(Oh, Jesus loves me, this I know)
Jesus loves me, I know He loves me
(Oh, the Bible tells me so)
Oh, the Bible tells me so, tell me so
(Oh, Jesus tells me so)
Tells me so
Oh, Jesus loves me, this I know, I know
