I go look all around I no see anything wey go hinder me
cause I love wey my daddy dey give me and daily dey ginger me
they wan give me the dollar  I say no
they wan give me the pounds  I say no
they say make I sign am , I say no
but I tell them na you I want o
e be like them no know say you are my heart desire
and anything wey concern you , I no go retire
cause I got something more than gold, ohh my daddy he's more than gold you are the lover of my soul, ohh this thing is more than gold
even if na dollar, wey them give me e no matter
even if them pull up in a Benz, I no go enter
I no go live your side we go dey till paradise
shey you dey feel my vibe me I get eternal life
even if na dollar, wey them give me e no matter
even if them pull up in a Benz, I no go enter
I no go live your side we go dey till paradise
shey you dey feel my vibe me I get eternal life
put am for inside your PATA, I no care for that your dollar
put am for inside your PATA, I no care for that your dollar
My head , my head e correct e correct
