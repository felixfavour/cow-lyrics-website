Eyin ni o, alade ina
(It is you, one with crown of fire)
Eyin ni o, elewu ogo
(It is you, one with the cloth of glory)
Eyin ni, jagun jagun labi orun
(It is you, heaven battle fighter)
Je…sus
Je…sus

Agbara le wo laso
(You are clothed with power)
Ogo laso ileke
(Clothed in glory)
Iji nla le gun lesin
(You ride on great storm)
Oba ayeraye o
(Forever king)

Eyin ni ina te ni ke ni o le gbamu
(You are the fire that no one can hold)
Odo niyin, tenikeni o le we ja
(River that has no end)
Aragbayamu yamu yamu…
(Incredible)
Okunrin ogun
(Mighty man in battle)
Kiki ina… le fi bora
(Covered in great fire)

Agbara le wo laso
(You are clothed with power)
Ogo laso ileke
(Clothed in glory)
Iji nla le gun lesin
(You ride on great storm)
Oba ayeraye o
(Forever king)


Alagbada ina
(One with the cloth of fire)
elewu itura
(One with the cloth of ease)
Oni bata Ogo tolo korin kese
(One with the shoe of glory)
Aro Dede ina ti kose daduro
