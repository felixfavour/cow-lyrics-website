Take us to deep, deep places
Where all we can see is You
Let us see open Heaven
With angels surrounding You
Here in the courts of Heaven
We want to hear from You
Give us a revelation
Of all that You want to do
Take us to deep, deep places
Where all we can see is You
Let us see open Heaven
With angels surrounding You
Here in the courts of Heaven
We want to hear from You
Give us a revelation
Of all that You want to do
Let Your glory fill this place
As Your people seek Your face
Let Your glory fill this place
As Your people seek Your face
(We say) yes, yes, yes, yes...
Your kingdom come
Your will be done
Your glory come
Let Heaven come
Your kingdom come
Your will be done
Your glory come
Let Heaven come
Revival come
Revival come
Revival come
Take us to deep, deep places
Take us to deep, deep places
Take us to deep, deep places
