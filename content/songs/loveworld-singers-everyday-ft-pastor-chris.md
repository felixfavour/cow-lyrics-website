Everyday I'll sing of Your steadfast love and mercy
The exceeding riches of your grace
Is beyond compare
The depth of your love
Is unsearchable
Oh lord, Great is thy faithfulness
Everyday you are my portion
Everyday my cup overflows

In thy favour my horn is exalted
Everyday you load me with benefits
Everyday new mercies i see
Oh lord your testimonies are sure
I rejoice in you the God of my salvation.
