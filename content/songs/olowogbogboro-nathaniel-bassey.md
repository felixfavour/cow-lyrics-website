Olowogbogboro is turning things around
Olowogbogboro is turning things around
Olowogbogboro is turning things around
For my good
For my good
Ko soun t'oo le se God
Heaven and earth adore you Lord
Your outstretched arm has given us victory
Miracles signs and wonders come from you
Testimonies just like that ohh
Words are not enough to tell of all you've done


Olowogbogboro is turning things around (turning things around)
Olowogbogboro is turning things around (everywhere I look)
Olowogbogboro is turning things around
For my good
For my good
Who would have thought Lord (never imagined)
That you would move this way God
You whose path none can trace
Oluwa mi, mighty are your ways
You have done more than I want o (than I want ohh)
There is nothing more to say Lord (absolutely nothing)
Olowogbogboro has turned things around
(he has turned things around just like that)
Olowogbogboro has turned things around
Olowogbogboro has turned things around
For my good
(for my good, for my good)
For my good
Things have turned around for me
Now I'm walking in victory
Jesus turned it around for me
He has given me victory
Things have turned around for me
(they have turned around for me)
Now I'm walking in victory
(I'm walking in victory)
Jesus turned it around for me
(just like that)
He has given me victory
(he's given me victory)
Things have turned around for me
(he turned it around for me)
Now I'm walking in victory
(and I'm walking in victory)
Jesus turned it around for me
(he turned it around for me)
He has given me victory
(now I have a victory)
Olowogbogboro has turned things around
(he's turned things around)
Olowogbogboro has turned things around (Ohh yes)
We will shout Halleluyah
We will shout praise the Lord
We will dance in the spirit
And rejoice in Your name
From sunrise to sunset
We'll shout praise the Lord
At the blast of the trumpet
Let Your praise fill the earth
Olowogbogboro (Olowogbogboro)
Olowogbogboro (Olowogbogboro)
Olowogbogboro (Olowogbogboro)
(great and mighty God)
(Olowogbogboro)
(That is your name)
(Olowogbogboro)
Olowogbogboro (Olowogbogboro)
Ye e yeh... (Olowogbogboro)
Tata la (Olowogbogboro)
You are the great and mighty God (Olowogbogboro)
With your outstretched hands (Olowogbogboro)
Save me with your arms Lord (Olowogbogboro)
Mighty to save (Olowogbogboro)
Olowogbogboro (Olowogbogboro)
We praise your name we lift you up
We praise your name we lift you up
