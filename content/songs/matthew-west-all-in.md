My feet are frozen on this middle ground
The water's warm here but the fire's gone out
I played it safe for so long the passion left
Turns out safe is just another word for regret
So I step to the edge and I take a deep breath
We're all dying to live
But we're all scared to death
And this is the part where my head tells my heart
You should turn back around
But there's no turning back now
I'm going all in
Headfirst to the deep end
I hear you calling
And this time the fear won't win
I'm going I'm going all in
I'm going I'm going all in
I'm going I'm going
I believe that one day I will see your kingdom come
And I wanna hear you say
Welcome home my child well done
So I step to the edge and I take a deep breath
I'm not turning back around
'Cause there's no turning back now
I'm going all in
Headfirst to the deep end
I hear you calling
I hear you calling
And this time the fear won't win
I'm going I'm going all in
I'm going I'm going all in
I'm going I'm going all in
I'm going I'm going all in
I'm going I'm going
All to you Jesus I freely give
As long as there's breath in these lungs
I will live
With reckless abandon my heart in your hands
I surrender it all I'm going
I'm going all in
I'm going I'm going
I'm going all in
I'm going all in
I'm going all in
Headfirst to the deep end
I'm going all in
I hear you calling
And this time the fear won't win
I'm going I'm going all in
I'm going I'm going all in
I'm going I'm going all in
I'm going I'm going all in
I'm going I'm going
I believe that one day
I will see your kingdom come
And I wanna hear you say
Welcome home my child well done
