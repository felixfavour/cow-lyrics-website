Love unchanging
God Your mercy never fades and I'm surrounded
By Your compassion and Your grace
Your love brighter than the sun
More beautiful than words could ever say
This endless light shining over all
It leads me to Your glory everlasting
In Your kindness
For the broken and the lost
You gave Your only son to bear my shame upon the cross
Your love brighter than the sun
More beautiful than words could ever say
This endless light shining over all
It leads me to Your glory everlasting
Your love amazing
Fills my heart and I sing out
There is none like You
There is nothing like Your love
