 Acts 1:8 KJV 
But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.

ðŸ”¥ We decree that none shall be distracted or lost; instead, they are established in the faith, strengthened by the Spirit, and built up as effective witnesses of the Gospel. Their lives are fruitful, and through them, many more are drawn into Your kingdom.
