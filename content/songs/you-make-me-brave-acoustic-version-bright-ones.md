[Instrumental]
I stand before You now
The greatness of Your renown
I have heard of the majesty and wonder of You
King of Heaven, in humility I bow
As Your love
In wave after wave
Crashes over me
Crashes over me
For You are for us
You are not against us
Champion of Heaven
You made a way for all to enter in
I have heard You call my name
I have heard the song of love that You sing
Oh, so I will let You draw me out beyond the shore
Into Your gracе, oh, Your grace
As Your love
In wave aftеr wave
Crashes over me
Crashes over me
For You are for us
You are not against us
Champion of Heaven
You made a way for all to enter in
