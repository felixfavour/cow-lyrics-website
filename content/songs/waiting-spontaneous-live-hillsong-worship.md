Thank you, Jesus
Speaking life
We don’t feel the waiting
‘Cause we know the other side
You’re stirring up the song of Your people
So, let it rise, let it rise
So, let it rise, let it rise
Let it rise, let it rise
Let it rise with all your love
Only You, Jesus
Only You, Jesus
Only You, Jesus
Only You, Jesus
Only You, Jesus
We’re gonna wait on Him
We’re not in a hurry
He’s been waiting for you
Why don’t you start to release your sound?
Open up your mouth, give Him praise, give Him thanks
And if you don’t know what to say
You just say the greatest word there is
The greatest name there is
Jesus
Jesus, we praise King Jesus (When we praise the Lord)
