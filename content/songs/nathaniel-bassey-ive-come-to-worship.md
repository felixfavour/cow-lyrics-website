I've come to worship
I've come to glorify Your name
For You are holy
Righteous and worthy is Your name
I've come to worship
I've come to glorify Your name
For You are holy
Righteous and worthy is Your name
I come by the blood and with thanksgiving
Into this holy place
I bow my knees and lift my hands
Before Your holy throne
Let the fragrance of my trumpet sound
Fill this temple as I worship
Hallelujah
Hallelujah to God
For You are worthy
Forever holy is Your name
