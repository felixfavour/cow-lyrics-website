I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin I wouldn't let my dear savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

Just like a blind man, I wandered along
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and a-stray
Straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right Praise the Lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the Lord, I saw the light

Once like a bird in prison I dwelt
No freedom from my sorrow I felt
But Jesus came and listened to me
And glory to God, He set me free

He set me free, yes, He set me free
And He broke the bonds of prison for me I'm glory bound my Jesus to see
For glory to God, He set me free

Now I am climbing higher each day
Darkness of night has drifted away
My feet are planted on higher ground
And glory to God, I'm homeward bound

He set me free, yes, He set me free
And He broke the bonds of prison for me I'm glory bound my Jesus to see
For glory to God, He set me free

Goodbye to sin and things that confound Naught of the world shall turn me around Daily I'm working, I'm praying too And glory to God, I'm going through

He set me free, yes, He set me free
And He broke the bonds of prison for me I'm glory bound my Jesus to see
For glory to God, He set me free

Some glad morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away; To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away (I'll fly away).

I'll fly away, Oh Glory I'll fly away; When I die, Hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away (I'll fly away).

Just a few more weary days and then,
I'll fly away; To a land where joy shall never end, I'll fly away (I'll fly away)

I'll fly away, Oh Glory I'll fly away; When I die, Hallelujah, by and by, I'll fly away (I'll fly away).
