There is acceptance for you at the table of the Lord
There is acceptance for you, no matter who you are
The mercy of the Father is greater than your sin
There is acceptance for you at the table of the Lord
There is acceptance for you at the table of the Lord
There is acceptance for you, no matter who you are
The mercy of the Fathеr is greater than your sin
Therе is acceptance for you at the table of the Lord
No matter who you are or where you're going to
No matter what you've done the Father's waiting here for you
No matter all the times you've turned your head in unbelief
The Father's love is greater than what you ever can conceive
Reach out, reach out, reach out
To Him!
There is acceptance for you at the table of the Lord
There is acceptance for you, no matter who you are
The mercy of the Father is greater than your sin
There is acceptance for you at the table of the Lord
At the table of the Lord
At the table of the Lord
