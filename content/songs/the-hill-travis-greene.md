The Hill... Hill... Hill
Sin around me
Pain is in me
Stress is on me
But I gotta keep looking up
Tears are streaming
Heart is beating
Others leaving
But I gotta keep looking up
Some will trust in horses and chariots
But I will look to the hills and I will not fear
Some may say that they found another way
But my eyes are on you and I will not move from...
The Hill... The Hill... Hill
Trouble has found me
Pressure is crowding
People doubting
But I gotta keep looking up
Ground is shaking
Walls are breaking
And my heart is racing
But I gotta keep looking
