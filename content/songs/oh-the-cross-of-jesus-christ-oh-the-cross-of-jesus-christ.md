On the day, that death surrendered
To the mighty cross of Jesus Christ
The earth would shake, beneath the weight
Of darkened skies

On His brow, a crown of sorrow
For a King whose weakness was our strength
No word He spoke, His love was shown
For all to see

Oh the cross of Jesus Christ
He's the reason I'm alive
For His blood, has set me free
It will never lose, it’s power for me!

Now the dawn, of resurrection
Floods the night, as hope prevails to shine
Salvation wakes, our chains to break
And we arise!

Oh the cross of Jesus Christ
He's the reason I'm alive
For His blood, has set me free
It will never lose, its power for me!

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Christ my victory!
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
He has won for me

On the day, He comes in glory
To reveal the fullness of His reign
Our hearts will bow, before the sound
Of Jesus name!

Oh the cross of Jesus Christ
He's the reason I'm alive
For His blood, has set me free
It will never lose, its power for me

Oh the cross of Jesus Christ
He's the reason I'm alive
For His blood, has set me free
It will never lose, its power for me
It will never lose, its power for me
It will never lose, its power for me
