Mercy is a song singing to my heart
Telling me it's OK come just as you are
I never heard a melody like the one
They're singing over me
And I just wanna sing along 'cause mercy is a song
Freedom is a choir swaying back and forth
Shining in the shadow of a stain glassed Sunday morning
Shouting hallelujah yesterday is gone
Oh freedom is a choir and mercy is a song
Singing ohhhhh there is a life for every soul
No matter where you've been just come on home
Let all god's children sing along
Hallelujah chains are gone
Mercy is a song
Guilty is a lie spoken by a fear
Saying after what you've done
You don't deserve to be free
But I can look him in the eye
And say this time you're wrong
'Cause guilty is a lie oh but mercy is a song
Singing ohhhhh there is a life for every soul
No matter where you've been just come on home
Let all god's children sing along
Hallelujah chains are gone
Mercy is a song
A song of the redeemed
I want to set free
A glimpse of what waits for you and me
Heaven is a mansion a promise in the sky
That one day we'll be singing
With those angels up on high
That old familiar melody
Like we've known it all along
Oh heaven is a mansion and mercy is a song
Heaven is a mansion and mercy is a song
Oh tell me can you hear it
Singing ohhhhh there is a life for every soul
There is a life for every soul
No matter where you've been just come along
No matter where you've been
Where you've been
Let all god's children sing along
Sing along
Hallelujah chains are gone
Let all god's children sing along
Sing along
Hallelujah chains are gone
Mercy is a song ohhh
Mercy is a song ohhh
Mercy is a song ohhh
