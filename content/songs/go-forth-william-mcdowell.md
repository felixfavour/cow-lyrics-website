God has given us the ability
God has given us creativity
God has given us His authority
We will go forth
Let us go forth with a vision
Let us go forth with dominion
Let us go forth with compassion
Let us go forth
God has given us the ability
God has given us creativity
God has given us His authority
We will go forth
Let us go forth with a vision
Let us go forth with dominion
Let us go forth with compassion
Let us go forth
No we won't turn our blind eye to our brothers in need
We will serve with compassion so the whole world will see
We will now see your power and the whole world will know
We're revealing your Kingdom but they won't know until we go
[Rap]
