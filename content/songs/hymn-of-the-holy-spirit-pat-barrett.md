Holy Spirit, guide my vision
Help me see the way You see
Always Jesus, ever Jesus
Christ in all as Christ in me
Holy Spirit, guide my speaking
Words of grace and truth abound
Let my lips be filled with stories
Of the mercy that I've found
You're the light, You're my path
You're the shepherd of my soul
All I am, all I have
Holy Spirit, lead me on
Holy Spirit, guide my hearing
Wake my ears to words You speak
In the thunder, in the stillness
Let Your voice be clear to me
Let Your voice be clear to me
You're the light, You're my path
You're the shepherd of my soul
All I am, all I have
Holy Spirit, lead me on
Oh, You're the light, You're my path
You're the shepherd of my soul
All I am, all I have
Holy Spirit, lead me on
