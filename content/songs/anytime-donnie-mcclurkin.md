You were not the one with the answers
You never acted like you always knew
But you opened up your heart to help me
Any time i needed you
Remembering my youth and as am older
You were there through things I went through
Lending me your smile your loving...
Any time I needed you
Any time
Ooh oh oh oh
Any time
Oh oh oh oh
An time I needed you
You were there any time
Oh oh oh oh
Any time
Oh oh oh oh
Any time I needed you
Time of worry and times of silence
A pray and a song that got me through
Yes you are the one I can rely on
Any time I need you
Time of good and times of trouble
Oho oo
Somehow it seems you always knew
You were always right there on a double
On a double
Any time I needed you
Any time
Ooh oh oh oh
Any time

An time I needed you
You were there any time
Oh oh oh oh
