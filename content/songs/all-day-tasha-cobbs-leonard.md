Chorus:
All Day
I've been walking around, I've been talking with You.
All Day
I'm determined to spend more time with you.
All Day
I've been walking around with You in my soul.
All Day
My time with you is gonna make me whole.
Today
I got on my knees, I was trying to pray,
Something on my heart that I need to say, to You,
But I got the job, so I can't be late, no
So I'm out the door, and I'm on my way.
But I
I don't want to leave You
And I
I don't want to go
My time
Time with You Lord, helps me to grow.
Can I
Can I take You there?
Can I
Take You everywhere?
Oh everything
Everything we'll share. I want to be with You.
