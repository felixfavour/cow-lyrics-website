Take this man to prison
The man heard Herod say
And then four squads of soldiers came
And carried him away
Chained up between two watchmen
Peter tried to sleep
But beyond the walls
An endless prayer was lifting for his keep
Then a light cut through the darkness
Of a lonely prison cell
And the chains that bound the man of God
Just opened up and fell
And running to his people
Before the break of day
There was only one thing on his mind
Only one thing to say
Angels watching over me
Every move I make
Angels watching over me
Angels watching over me
Every step I take
Angels watching over me
