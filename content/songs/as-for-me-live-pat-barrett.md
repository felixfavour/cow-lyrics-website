(Mmm, mmm)
Your love, oh Lord, is strength to my soul
Hope for tomorrow, it won’t let go
Your presence is the joy of my life
To You, I lift my eyes
[Chorus: Pat Barrett]
As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord
We will sing of Your love forevermore
As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord
Serve the Lord
Your word alone, a lamp to my feet
A light to my path as You’re leading me
Your ways, oh Lord, are higher than mine
To You, I lift my eyes
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin with Pat Barrett]
As for me and my house, wе will serve the Lord
Wе will sing of Your love forevermore
As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord
Serve the Lord
[Bridge: Pat Barrett with Chris Tomlin]
Open up every door
Write it on every wall
Sing it in every room
Let's open up every door
Write it on every wall
Sing it in every room, yeah, yeah, yeah
Open up every door
Write it on every wall
Sing it in every room, Jesus, yeah
Open up every door
Write it on every wall
Sing it in every room, Jesus
