Solid, my solid rock
Solid, my solid rock
Solid, my solid rock
You are solid, my solid rock
You are solid, my solid rock
You are solid, my solid rock
You are solid, my solid rock
When everything around me tries to crumble and shake
Your consistent reputation is what holds me in place
Today I'll tell the whole world
You are solid, my solid rock
You are solid, my solid rock
You are solid, my solid rock
So when the sun don't shine
And when the rain won't cease
You're always there, there to comfort me
So I will stand it on up a mystery
That I can't explain but I believe that you are
Solid, my solid rock
Solid, my solid rock
You are solid, my solid rock
You are solid, my solid rock
I can lean on You and You won't move
I can cry to You and You won't move
I can trust You cause You're my
Solid, my solid rock
You are solid, my solid rock
I can lean on You and You won't move
I can cry to You and You won't move
I can trust You cause You're my
Solid, my solid rock
Solid, my solid rock
Solid, my solid rock
I can lean on You and You won't move
I can cry to You and You won't move
I can trust You 'cause You're my Rock
You are my rock
You are my rock
You are my rock
You are my rock
You are my rock
You are my rock
I can lean on You and You won't move
I can cry to You and You won't move
I can trust You cause You're my
Solid, my solid rock
You are my solid, my solid rock
You are solid, my solid rock
You are solid, my solid rock
