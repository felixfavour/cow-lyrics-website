And now let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Because of what the Lord has done for us

Let my whole life be expressions of Your grace

When I searched the highest mountains
Looked for You in deepest valleys
Searched the rivers, small and shallow
Deep and wide o, broad and narrow
I realized there is no one like You
In the earth and in the skies too
Ko ma si, ko si no one like You
Nobody, nobody o

There's nobody like You, Lord
There's nobody like our God
There is nobody like You, Lord
Like You Lord, like our God
There's nobody like You, Lord

There is nobody like You, Lord
Like You Lord, like our God (nobody like You, Lord)
So I lift Your name up higher, higher

Celebrate You louder, louder
Lift Your name up higher
I'll sing it louder and shout it higher, higher, higher
Lift Your name up higher, higher, higher
Celebrate You louder, louder
Lift Your name up higher
I'll sing it louder and shout it higher, higher, higher

I know a God who's merciful and kind
Faithful and gracious
I'm the apple of his eyes
The thought that fills his heart every morning noon and night
He loved me when I didn't care
And was patient til I came running back into his arms
Look how he turned my life around
Made me a shining star
His glory to reveal

I will worship him forever
Love him forever because
This God is too good oh
I will worship him forever
Love him forever because
This God is too good oh

Don't look too far to see how good he is
Just look at me e e
He took me from the miry clay
Set my feet upon the rock I'm standing in his righteousness
Ooh oh oh he took away my sin and shame
Gave me a brand new name a brand new name
His beloved and the redeemed
Look how he turned my life around turned my life around
Made me a shinning light
His glory to reveal e e e e

When we get to heaven
I know I'll see Jesus
Paul and Silas and Abraham
The whole of them would be there
Many many questions I want to ask
Many many things I want to say
First of all I will go to him and say
Thank you Jesus
