Oh You are God
And we lift you up
We'll keep singing, we'll keep praising
We won't stop
Giving all we got
Cos you're worthy of all glory
Oh, there's is no other
You are forever
Lord over all
Nobody like you, no one beside you
To you let endless praise resound
Every night and day
And with no delay
Let endless praise resound
Boundless love light before the sun
Your glory eternal
Never stops giving all you got
Creation keeps singing
Oh there's is no other
You are forever
Lord over all
There's nobody like you
No one beside you
To you let endless resound
Every night and day
And with no delay
Let endless praise resound
To you let endless resound
Every night and day
And with no delay
Let endless praise resound
We lift you up up up
We giving you our love love love
For everything you've done done done
We give you all the praise
We lift you up up up
We giving you our love love love
For everything you've done done done
We give all the praise
To you let endless praise resound
Every night and day
And with no delay
Let endless praise resound
To you let endless praise resound
Every night and day
And with no delay
Let endless praise resound
To you
