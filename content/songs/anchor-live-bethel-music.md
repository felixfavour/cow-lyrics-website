In every season, in every change
You are near
In every sorrow, You are my strength
You are near
[Pre-Chorus]
A peace in the storm
Your voice I will follow
In weakness, I rise
Remembering You hold my world
I’m holding on to hope
I’m holding on to grace
I’m fully letting go
I’m surrendered to Your ways
The anchor for my soul
Father, You will never change
I love You, I love You
My great Redeemer, my constant Friend
You are near
My faithful Father, You took me in
You are near
