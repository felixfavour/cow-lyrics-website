You search my heart and know me well
you know when I lie and when I rise

You are familiar with all my ways
You know my journey, You’re my path

I’m grateful, Lord, I’m precious in Your sight
I’m grateful, Lord, You’re mindful of me
I’m grateful, Lord, I’m precious in Your sight
I’m grateful, Lord, You’re mindful of me

In Your image was I made
For Your pleasure Lord, I live
In Your image was I made
For Your pleasure Lord, I live

You wove me together in my mother’s womb
My breath and my frame came from You
Oh, what an honour to bear Your name
Invigorated with Your life

I’m grateful, Lord, I’m precious in Your sight
I’m grateful, Lord, You’re mindful of me
I’m grateful, Lord, I’m precious in Your sight
I’m grateful, Lord, You’re mindful of me

In Your image was I made
For Your pleasure Lord, I live
In Your image was I made
For Your pleasure Lord, I live

You’re my beginning
The Lord of my present
You’re my forever, Lord
You’re my beginning
The Lord of my present
You’re my forever, Lord

In Your image was I made
For Your pleasure Lord, I live
In Your image was I made
For Your pleasure Lord, I live
