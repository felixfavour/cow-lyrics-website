Maybe I succeed a little
I jumped up from the floor to the middle
You think I want the credit I don't
Cause that glory, ain't made for me, no
I know who sits on the throne
Who makes the stage and writes the songs
And I know I, couldn't do this on my own
And as much as I complain
I've seen more sunshine than rain
And I could thank, my lucky stars
But that's not where, my blessings are
No they come from, the Father's heart
Not the sky, not chance, but truth is
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
Today I'm in a happy place
And I know it didn't happen by mistake
I love how He wrote my life
And I love how He sees my heart
So I fall to my knees and I say that I'm grateful
When every morning starts
So I don't thank, my lucky stars
But that's not where, my blessings are
No they come from, the Father's heart
Not the sky, not chance, but truth is
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
From the very beginning
This life that I'm living
Was part of Your plan all along
So I don't thank, my lucky stars
Cause that's not where, my blessings are
No they come from, the Father's heart
Not the sky, not chance, but truth is
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
Sing yes, Jesus loves me
Sing yes, Jesus loves me
Sing yes, Jesus loves me
For the bible tells me
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
C'mon one more time
Let me hear you sing
Yes, Jesus loves me
Sing yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
For the bible tells me so
It tells me so
See I don't thank, my lucky stars
Cause that's not where, my blessings are
No they come from, the Father's heart
Not the sky, not chance, but truth is
I'm not lucky, I'm loved
