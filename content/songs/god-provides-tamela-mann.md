God provides, so why do I worry about my life
When you come to my rescue a thousand times
Every other voice it is a lie
God provides
God provides
In ways I can't explain and can't deny
The little that I have he multiplies
Just when I feel he won't show up on time
God provides
He'll come through
When the clouds of doubt rain down on you
And test everything you thought you knew
Now you finally see what God can do, for you
So tonight
Close your eyes
There's no more need to fight
Watch God provide
God provides
It's hard to say when there's no food to eat
Or what you see feels all that life will be
And will this be another year of misery, for me
But my faith, can't survive on just things I see
And my feelings can't control my destiny
See God I only want what you believe, for me
