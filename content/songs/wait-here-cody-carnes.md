In Your arms, I am found
When I'm at my end
Take this heart, hold it now
God, my only friend
Enemies every side
Yet here I find my rest
Fear will not fill my mind
In Your presence, I'm safe from death
I will wait here
All I need comes from You
Why not stay here
There's  no place else I'd rather be
I will wait here
All I need comes from You
Why not stay here
There's  no place else I'd rather be
[Instrumental]
[Bridge 1]
Faithful, always
Faithful, always
Faithful, always
Always, always
Faithful, always
Faithful, always
Faithful, always
Always, always
