I look up towards the sky
Eyes fixed on You
Your presence is where I hide
Above every fear I rise
Eyes fixed on You
And You'll never leave my side
Through fire or flood
Through wind and the waves
I follow Your voice through the darkest of days
Whatever may come
You carry me through
Oh, You are the One I choose
[Post-Chorus]
Eyes fixed on You
Eyes fixed on You
I walk with You on the waves
Eyes fixed on You
You're with me, I know I'm safe
Completely, You captivate
Eyes fixed on You
I trust every word You say
