Young but now I'm older
Never have I seen the righteous forsaken
Believe in what You told me
You would always hold me safe in the palm of Your hand
Even though I go through the valley of the shadow
I'm not forgotten
And I'll never let a day go by my, my
Gonna shout it from the mountain
I just wanna say I'm not afraid
I know that You are with me always
Young but now I'm older
Never have I seen the righteous forsaken
Believe in what You told me
You would always hold me safe in the palm of Your hand
Even though I go through the valley of the shadow
I'm not forgotten
And I'll never let a day go by my, my
Gonna shout it from the mountain
I just wanna say I'm not afraid
I know that You are with me always
I give You praise
For every day I know You'll never leave me, no way
