[Instrumental]
You were the Word at the beginning
One with God the Lord Most High
Your hidden glory in creation
Now revealed in You our Christ
What a beautiful name it is
What a beautiful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King
What a beautiful name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a beautiful name it is
The name of Jesus
You didn't want heaven without us
So, Jesus, You brought heaven down
My sin was great, Your love was greater
What could separate us now?
What a wonderful name it is
What a wonderful name it is
The name of Jesus Christ my King
What a wonderful name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a wonderful name it is
The name of Jesus
What a wonderful name it is
The name of Jesus
