[Intro]
All over the world, we wanna sing this all for you
Let me hear you say
I hear the sound of breakthrough

Oh, I hear the sound of breakthrough
My breakthrough is here

Oh, I hear the sound of breakthrough
My breakthrough is here
Everything that I need, You supply
Every promise of Heaven is mine
[Refrain]
I am healed, I am free
God has spoken, I agree
My breakthrough is here, oh
My brеakthrough is here
(Say, oh, I hear thе sound of breakthrough)
I hear the sound of breakthrough
I hear the sound of breakthrough
Oh, I hear the sound of breakthrough
My breakthrough is here
