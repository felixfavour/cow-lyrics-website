Iyo  by Tim Godfrey ft. SMJ & Emeka

{Iyo, yo, yo } [x3 ]
For many times you dey bless me
For many doors, you are opening
When I'm sick
You are my healer
When I'm down
You are my lifter
Even when I call
You dey answer
Nara ekele' mjiri bia

{Iga sim' ekele ya (x3)
Obu gi gemerem Ihe onemere muo } [x2 ]
{Iyo, yo, yo (x3)
Nara ekele' mjiri bia} [x2 ]
[Chants]
Okwa'imana onye Chukwu Goziri
Ogiwo ya
(Who God bless is Blessed )
Onye Chukwu tinyere nelu
Onye ga' edokwa gi nala
(Who God lifts up,
No one can bring down )
(Egwu diya, egwu, egwu diya)
{My God talk and do
Jehovah over do
If no be for you
Tell me, wetin I for do } [x2 ]
{You've done so much for me
I cannot tell it all
You dey always stand by me
You no dey let me fall oh} [x2 ]

[Chants]
[Outro]
{Iyo, yo, yo
Iyo, yo, yo
Iyo, yo, yo
Nara ekele' mjiri bia} [x2 ]
