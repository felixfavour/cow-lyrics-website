Into the night, heaven came near
Wrapped in flesh, the King is here
To bring us life, and be our peace
To heal our hearts, and set us free
Come, and see what love has done
Come worship, singing glory hallelujah, glory hallelujah
Come, and join the angel's song
Come worship, singing glory hallelujah, glory hallelujah
Now His love, has come for us
Emanuel, God's only Son
To breathe this air, to know our pain
To break the power, of death and grave
Come, and see what love has done
Come worship, singing glory hallelujah, glory hallelujah
Come, and join the angel's song
Come worship, singing glory hallelujah, glory hallelujah
[Bridge]
Forever behold, the light of the world
Forever behold the glory of Jesus
Alive in us now, forever we're changed
Oh stand and proclaim the glory of Jesus
