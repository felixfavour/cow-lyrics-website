Moses stood on a mountain
Waiting for you to pass by
You placed your hand over his face
In your presence he wouldn't die
All Israel saw the glory and it shines down through the age
Now you've called me to boldly seek your face
Show me your face, Lord
Show me your face
And then gird up my legs, I might stand in this holy place
Show me your face, Lord
Your power and your grace
I will make it to the end, if I could just see your face
David knew there was something more
Than the ark of your presence
In a manger messiah was born
Amongst kings and some peasants
And all Israel saw the glory
And it shines down through the age
Now you've called us to boldly seek your face
Show me your face, Lord
Show me your face
And then gird up my legs that I might stand in this holy place
Show me your face, Lord
Your power and your grace
And I will make it to the end if I could just see your face
If we could just see your face
Show me your face, Lord
Show me your face
And then gird up my leg I might stand in this holy place
Show me your face, Lord
Your power and your grace
I will make it to the end if I could just see your face
And I will make it to the end if I could just see your face
I will make it to the end Abba show me your face
