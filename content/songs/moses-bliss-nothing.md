Nothing wey God no fit do

Nothing wey God no fit do
Nothing wey God no fit do
Nothing wey God no fit change oo
E no matter wetin dem be tell you

Nothing wey God no fit do
No man wey God no fit bless
No man wey God no fit help oo
E no matter wetin you dey go through

No man wey God no fit bless
No man wey God no fit lift (Ah)

No door wey God no fit open
No man wey God no fit heal
No man wey God no fit touch oo

Never seen the sea begging bread

No man wey God no fit heal
Nothing wey God no fit do

Nothing wey God no fit do
E no matter wetin you dey go through
I'm here to tell you
Nothing wey God no fit do
E no matter wetin you dey go through
Make you no forget
Nothing wey God no fit do
