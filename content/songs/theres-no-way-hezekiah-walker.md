There's no way I can live without You in my life
I'd be like a ship without, without a sail
I would be nothing, nothing
No way, no way, I can live without You
There is no way I can live without You in my life
I'd be like a ship without, without a sail
I would be nothing, nothing
No way, no way, I can live without You
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus, praise, praise You, yeah
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus, praise, praise
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus, I wanna give You praise
I wanna give You praise tonight
Hallelujah, thank you Jesus, oh, oh, ooh, praise
We've come to give you praise, Jesus
Say Hallelujah, thank you Jesus, oh, oh praise
I've come to give you praise tonight
Say Hallelujah, thank you Jesus, oh praise, yeah
Praise
Come on and shout praise tonight
Come on and say praise
I've come to give You praise, oh Lord
Said I give You praise
