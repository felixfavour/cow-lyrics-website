Someday we'll open our eyes
And finally discover
We are united by one blood
Then we would realize
We're sisters and brothers
And what the world needs now is love
There's a dreamer inside each one of us
Who wants to believe that;
There is still a dream to believe in
There is still a hope after hope is gone
We can be the Father's hands, give love a chance
And show the world there is still a dream
We've got to let freedom ring
To each generation
For every man, woman, boy, and girl
And teach the whole world to sing
Like one congregation
In harmony around the world
