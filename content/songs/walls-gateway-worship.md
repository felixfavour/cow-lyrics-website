We are daughters and sons
Singing as one
We've got a hope now
Walls have tried to divide
But nothing can hide
The power that we've found
You are walking with us
And all of the walls are turning to dust
They are falling down
Sing praise we sing praise
We fill the skies with songs from our hearts
Sing praise we sing praise
'Til enemies know how faithful You are
Oh God, yeah
High we lift up Your name
Put darkness in chains
You go before us
And love is swallowing fear
And all of the walls
Will soon disappear
They are crumbling down
Come on, let's lift it up together
