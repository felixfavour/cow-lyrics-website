VERSE 1:
Every time I come running
I find grace on repeat
You welcome me with open arms
No matter where I have been
Every time I surrender
Every time I fall
I find grace more precious
Than I did before
CHORUS 1:
So I’m gonna lay my world down
Here at Your feet
Look to the heavens
For all I need
I’m gonna sing my heart out
Praise on repeat
To the God who’s never given up on me
VERSE 2:
You’re the mercy at midnight
You’rе the kindness of dawn
My hope in еvery waking hour
And the strength I lean on
Every time it comes to sundown
And the night sets in
Let my soul remember
Just how good You’ve been
And again and again
My heart will sing
