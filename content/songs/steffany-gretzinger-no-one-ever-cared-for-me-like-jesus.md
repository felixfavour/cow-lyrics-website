If my heart could tell a story
If my life could sing a song
If I have a testimony
If I have anything at all
No one ever cared for me, like Jesus
He's faithful hand has held me all this way
And when I'm old and grey and all my days are numbered on the earth let it be known in you alone my joy was found...
let my children tell their children
let this be their memory that all my treasure was in heaven,and you were everything to me.. No one ever cared for me like Jesus...
I'm still in love, Your still enough for me
Still all I want, Your still my everything!!
    'No one ever cared for me like Jesus
