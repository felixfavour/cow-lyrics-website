I've seen Him do incredible, impossible things
Miracles and wonders, He can conquer anything
If I can be honest, there were times I doubted Him
Thought He didn't hear me when I called
I saw others being blessed while I waited my turn
I had no clue, didn't know what to do
But I remembered: His record is good
I remembered His record is good
I've read about the time when He fed the multitude
With two fish and five loaves; how amazing it was!
But I have to admit sometimes my faith gets weak
Even though I can't see, He's still there
So when I have no clue and don't know what to do
I remember His record is good;
I remember His record is good
He spoke to the wind, and the storm ceased
Healed the blind and made him see, see...
And just like you and me
We have our own testimony
Of the goodness, the goodness of God
When You have no clue and don't know what to do
Just remember His record is good;
Just remember His record is good
He can do it. He can do it. His record is good
(3x)
He can do it. He can do it. He can do it
His record is good
Still a healer; still a deliverer
He can do it; His record is good
(2x)
He's a provider; my regulator
He can do it; His record is good
His record is good! (4x)
He can do it. He can do it. He can do it
His record is good!
(3x)
