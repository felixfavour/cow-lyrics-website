Lately
Underneath this darkened sky
A spark has finally come to life
And washed over me
Steer me
From out of this delusive night
I got so much time for wild surprises
I can't hold them anymore
[Pre-Chorus: Josh Groban]
But how much this could mean to me
I can only imagine
Just how deeply we perceive
All the colors that we found
[Chorus: Josh Groban]
Would you follow me out on the thin branches?
Going blind, trying to soak up the sun
I believe, I believe that the space in between
Is what we become
Pеdal back through the fog through to second chances
Gotta fly at thе end of the fall
And when my hour's up
I wanna say I've filled my cup to the fullest
