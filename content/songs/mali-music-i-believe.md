thinking about the world, looking at the nation
suicide,
genocide
homicide
big words come to mind
times are changing, yeah
no more rumors
there are wars going on
twisted doctors, scientist making cloths
economy got some backs against the wall
people dieing for no reason at all
people of God don't even read their Bibles
there no faith no trust in the word
but everybody seems to be quoting scriptures and other word they heard
pastors leaving Pulpits cause they're tired
it's all based on how we feel
overheard two people speaking the other day
one said that God's not real but
CHORUS
I'm just one of them old people whose gotta hold on
sometimes I can't see but I believe he's taking care of me
oooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh
I'm just one of them old people God's gotta hold on
And I believe I believe yeah
I believe I believe
so I'll choose to look on the brighter side
inspite
of all the negativity I'm surrounded by
no it ain't perfect but dats alright
cuz he's hand is on me
and it's keeping me alive
so many disappointment
so much I don't understand
so much I don't have answers for
that's what makes me trust you more
in a world that's always changing
everything's rearranging
but no matter what's going on
I'mma be standing
I'mma be holding on
your truth, their truth, my truth
your God My God Our view
all I know is that's one thing now it is
cuz we all need hope we all need faith in
I'm just one of them old people whose gotta hold on
sometimes I can't see but I still believe he's taking care of me
yes he is
I'm just one of them old people God's gotta hold on
don't you let go of me Lord please
I believe I believe yeah
I believe I believe    X2
