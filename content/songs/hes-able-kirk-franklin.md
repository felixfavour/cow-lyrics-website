[Intro: Kirk Franklin]
Come on, put them hands together, come on
One, two, three
[Chorus: The Family Choir & 
Kirk Franklin
]
He's able (
Eh, come on put them hands together, say
)
He's able (
You're able, thank you, Jesus
)
He's able (
I know that you can
)
I know that He can do it (
He said he would
)
He said He'd help me through it (
He's able
)
He's able (
Thank you, Lordy, you keep makin' a way, out of no way
)
He's able (
Hallelujah, I'm glad about it, you're able
)
He's able (
Oh, I know that you can
)
I know that He can do it (
He said he would
)
He said He'd help me through it (
Listen
)
Hold on, my brother, your change is gonna come
Be strong, my sister, for your work is not done, no
Just keep on believin' and hold on tight
He's able to give you joy in the mornin' light
[Chorus: The Family Choir & 
Kirk Franklin
]
He's able (
Thank you, Jesus, you're able
)
He's able (
Oh hallelujah, I know that I know, that I know you're able
)
He's able (
Thank you, Lordy, I know that you can
)
I know that He can do it (
He said
)
He said He'd help me through it (
Come on, say it, David
)
