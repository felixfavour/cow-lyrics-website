[Intro: Chris Tomlin]
Oh yeah
Some people think You're distant, just some words on a page
That You're nothing more than fables, handed down along the way
But I've seen You part the waters
When no one else could pull me from, the deep
That's who You are to me
Some people think You just live in cathedrals made of stone
But I know You live inside my heart, I know that it's Your home
And I've seen You in a sunset and in the eyes of a stranger on the street
That's who You are to me
[Chorus: Chris Tomlin & Lady A, 
Chris Tomlin
]
You're amazing, faithful, love's open door
When I'm empty You fill me with hunger for more
Of Your mercy, Your goodness
Lord, You're the air that I breathe
That's who You are to me
Who You are to me
Sometimes I have my doubts, I'm sure that everybody does
And I wonder when I stumble, am I still worthy of Your love?
But I know that I get stronger when I'm talking to You down on my knees
You're everything I need
