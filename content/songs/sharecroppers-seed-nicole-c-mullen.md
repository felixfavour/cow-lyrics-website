He's never been scared of hard work
So why are his hands trembling
And how could something so small
Be all so weighty
On the scales of what could be
This tiny seed has potential
For a better way of life
And how he sows it is crucial
For his little ones, his wife
So he prays to the Lord of the harvest
Would you rain down on the least of these
Would you please multiply and divide them
These are my sharecropper's seeds
These are my Sharecropper's seeds
It yielded more, than he'd ever hoped for
Enough to take care of things
'Til the landowner came and said
I want more
And gave him less than agreed
