Woke up this mornin' and realized I've been made brand new
All of my old friends are askin', "What happened to you?"
Oh, that man is gone, He's in the grave where He belongs
That debt was paid upon a cross and I'm movin' on
I'm done holdin' on to the lies in my head
They're just whispers and whispers, are nothin' in the end
I keep my eyes on what lies ahead
Today is a new day and yesterday is dead
All of my old ways, they left my hеart broken and bruised
But thank God they did 'causе the old me was brought back to You
But that man is gone, He's in the grave where He belongs
That debt was paid upon a cross and I'm movin' on
I'm done holdin' on to the lies in my head
They're just whispers and whispers, are nothin' in the end
I keep my eyes on what lies ahead
Today is a new day and yesterday is dead
That man is gone, He's in the grave where He belongs
That debt was paid upon a cross and I'm movin' on
I'm movin' on
I'm done holdin' on to the lies in my head
They're just whispers and whispers, are nothin' in the end
I keep my eyes on what lies ahead
Today is a new day and yesterday is dead
Today is a new day and yesterday is dead
