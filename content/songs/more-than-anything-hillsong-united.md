You knew us from the start
Our every moment
Though we fell apart
You chose to love us
Never letting go
You sent Your Son for us
He came into the world
With one desire
To lead us from our sins
Remove our failures
So we could meet with You
You know ourselves as Yours
[Pre-Chorus]
In a world that tries to
Find a way in itself
Searching high and low
Looking for a meaning
We will hold to what we
Know is truth know is love
Life is found when we give
Ourselves all to You, Lord
