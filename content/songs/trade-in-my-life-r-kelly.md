[Intro]
Trade in my life
Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes
Trade in my life for you
Sittin' here wonderin' how did things go wrong
Every night asking myself what happened to our happy home
Will I ever see you again, I need to know my friend
Now the past has gone away but tomorrow's on it's way
Though the sun is going down, I need you around
I'm willing to trade in my life
Trade in my life
Oh for you, oh yes, oh yes
Trade in my life for you
Now I'm sitting here
Reminiscing on what we used to share
And how we used to be such a happy pair, oh yeah
I cannot believe we've thrown it all away
Tell me will I see you again someday?
Now the past is gone away
But tomorrow's on its way
Though the sun is going down
And I need you around - trade
