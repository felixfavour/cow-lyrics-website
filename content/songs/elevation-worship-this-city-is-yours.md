This city Lord, it is yours
This city Lord it is yours
This city Lord it is yours
This city Lord it is yours
So break our hearts, break our hearts
For the people who are far from you
Break our hearts
Teach us to love
The way you loved us
Send us out, send is out
And pour out your fire
And flow through our lives
Send us out, send us out
This city Lord it is yours
This city Lord it is yours
So break our hearts
Break our hearts
For the people who are far from your
Break our hearts
Teach us to love
The way you loved us
Send us out, send us out
And pour out your fire
Flow through our lives
Send us out, send us out
The heart in my chest
It is beating so fast
I can hardly contain all the hope
In my veins as I see you alive
In this city arise like the sun shining
Bright we see darkness and night run
This city Lord it is yours
This city Lord it is yours
This city Lord it is yours
This city Lord it is yours
Teach us to love
The way you loved us
Send us out, send us out
Pour out your fire
Flow through our lives
Send us out, send us out
We'll take to the streets with fire in our hearts
Send us out, send us out
Send us out, send us out
Send us out, send us out
Send us out, send us out
Send us out, send us out
