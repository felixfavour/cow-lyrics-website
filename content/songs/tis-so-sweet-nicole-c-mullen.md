'Tis so sweet, to trust in Jesus
Just to take Him at His word
Just to rest, upon His promise
Just to know, thus says the L-ord
Jesus Jesus how I trust Him
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
Jesus Jesus, pr-ecious Jesus
Oh for grace to trust Him more
Oh how sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to trust His cleansing blood
And in simple faith to plunge me
'Neath the healing cleansing flood
I'm so glad, I learned to trust Thee
Precious Jesus Savior Friend
And I know, that Thou art with me
Will be with me to the e-nd
La la-la la la-la la-l-a
