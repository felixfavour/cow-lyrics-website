Twisting around the bend and back again for too long
There was no traction when I tried to climb the wall
Trapped in a circle of life
With no end in sight
But You saw me in the maze
And pulled me out of darkness
And the essence of my praise
Is centered on Your grace
Is centered on Your grace
Every winding road all seemed to go nowhere
Every cry for help fell down up dear ears
That's when I called out Your name
And еverything changed
When You saw mе in the maze
And pulled me out of darkness
And the essence of my praise
Is centered on Your grace
Is centered on Your grace
