There are words that comes and goes that few people really know what it makes to really know some bad days,though though the tears may fade away and so glad your love would stay cause I love you,and you show me , Jesus,what it really makes too love.Though the words may comes and goes as your people really know what it takes to really love,serve,brand in all your love,Though the gists may fade away,am so glad your love will stay cause I love you and you show me Jesus,what it really takes to love.The lesser I cry you loved me,When I should have died you loved me,i never know why you loved me,its  mystery to me now can see Jesus.When all hope was gone you loved me,you gave a song that you loved me,now I can go on cause you love me,its mystery to me now can see Jesus,then I started crying  you loved me , when I should have died you loved me,i never know why you loved me,its mystery to me now i can see Jesus,when all hope was gone you love me, you gave me a song that you love me,now I can go on cause you love me,its mystery to me now I can see Jesus.......Lord recreate the ways 3to love.Thats love.
