I could have lost my mind
Wanted to give up so many times
But God was my anchor, a consistent way maker
Yes, I'm grateful God covered me
Well the enemy came against me
Attacked my body and my ministry
But what God ordains, He will maintain
I'm grateful He covered me
You covered me
Hands of protection around me
Your grace and mercy covered me
If not for Your grace and Your mercy
Thank you Lord, You covered me
I could have lost my mind
Wanted to give up so many times
But God was my anchor, a consistent way maker
Yes, I'm grateful God covered me
Well the enemy came against me
Attacked my body and my ministry
But what God ordains, He will maintain
I'm grateful He covered me
