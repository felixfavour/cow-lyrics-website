Hopped in my car
Went down to Birmingham, Alabama
There I went to the Museum Of Civil Rights
And got a lesson in suffering
There I saw the likes of Rosa Parks
Medgar Evers, Dr. Martin Luther King
And I got all emotional singin'
"We shall overcome, let freedom ring"
So now, I'm looking for a boy, looking for a girl
Who's got a dream inside to change the world
Give me a lady, come on give me a man
Who's strong enough to take a stand
And be a black light, a candle in the darkness
We need some more, black light, courageous and strong
'Till there is no more bigotry and madness
All it takes is a spark, and the fire will burn on and on
I stood on my front porch with all the lights out
Guess what I was seeing
There was a myriad of diamonds flung out
Across a velvet sky
And it served to remind me
Of the perseverance of those before me
'Cause the darker the night
The brighter the star lights are gonna shine
