I can hear the sound
Of a million angels singing all around
Holy is Your name
I can hear the chorus
The never-ending chorus of praise
Worthy is the Lamb
[Pre-Chorus]
Though I once was blind, now I believe
Though I once was lost, You rescued me
Though I once was dead, now I'm alive
Jesus, my only plea, Jesus, my everything
Isn't He beautiful? Isn't He beautiful?
There's no sweeter name I know than Jesus
To the One enthroned
We cast down еvery crown, unwearied sing
Holy is Your namе
With every knee we bow
With every voice we shout
Sing worthy, worthy is our King
