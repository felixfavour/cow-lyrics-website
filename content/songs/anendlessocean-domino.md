My head goes low Yes I'm  servant  before  you
Ain't  nothing  outta control, with you holding  it  together
Terror  is  an outsider, I won't  let  in
Help  me keep my composure
Father  will you help  me
Yeah yeah yeah  yeah  yeah
I'm  trynna let  be, let  go of  all that  takes  you  a step away from  my soul
Yea help  me push'em  down Let  it  ripple,  through, like  the effect  is  domino
You're  the reason there's  life  in  my bones
Good intentions, sweet  emotions, you're  like th e  warming  fire  in  the cold.
Yea my head  goes low  (my head, my head, my head)
Yes I'm  servant  before  you
Your  unconditional love;  it  never  stumbles nor  waiver  (never  fails)
Your  absence  is  the heartbreak I  don't  wanna  feel I see  your  yearning, your  desire,
No way! I'm  trynna let  be, let  go I won't  second  guess  it of  all that  takes  you  a step away from  my soul
Yea help  me push'em  down Let  it  ripple,  through, like  the effect  is  domino
You're  the reason there's  life  in  my bones
Good intentions, sweet  emotions, you're  like the warming  fire  in  the cold.
Oh ouu  oh Of  all I  imagined and  more,  you're  it  all
There's no  comparison to  your  love, to  your  heart I'm  trynna let  be, let  go of  all that  takes  you  a step away from  my soul
Yea help  me push'em  down Let  it  ripple,  through, like  the effect  is  domino Oh   oh  oh
