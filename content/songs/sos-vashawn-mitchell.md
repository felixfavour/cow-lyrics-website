Help
I don't know what to do
And I'm depending on you
To see me through
Help
When trouble comes my way
And I don't know what to say
Lord have your way
[Chorus:]
Help me
Help me
Help me
Help me
Help
When I don't understand
What's in your master plan
And I need you direction
Help
When I am all alone
And I need someone to call on
To love me and care for me
Lord, I need your help
Just can't make it
No without your help
Ooohhh
Lord, I need you help
Just can't make it no
Without your help
