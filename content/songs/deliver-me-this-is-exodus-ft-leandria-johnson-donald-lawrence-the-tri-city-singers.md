He leads me beside still waters
He restoreth my soul
When you become a believer
Your spirit is made right
And sometimes, the soul doesn't get to notice
It has a hole in it
Due to things that's happened in the past
Hurt, abuse, molestation
But we wanna speak to you today and tell you
That God wants to heal the hole in your soul
Some people's actions are not because their spirit is wrong
But it's because the past has left a hole in their soul
May this wisdom help you get over your past
And remind you that God wants to heal the hole in your soul
I have my sister Le'Andria here
She's gonna help me share this wisdom
And tell this story
Lord
Deliver me, yeah
'Cause all I seem to do is hurt me
Hurt me, yeah
Lord
Deliver me
'Cause all I seem to do is hurt me
(Yes, sir)
Hurt me, yeah, yeah
(I know we should be finishing but)
(Sing it for me two more times)
Lord
Deliver me, yeah
'Cause all I seem to do is hurt me
(Na-ha)
Hurt me
(One more time)
Yeah
Lord
(Oh)
Deliver me
'Cause all I seem to do is hurt me, yeah
Hurt me, yeah
Whoa, yeah
And my background said
(Whoa-whoa, Lord)
Oh yeah (deliver me)
God rescued me from myself, from my overthinking
If you're listening out there
Just repeat after me if you're struggling with your past
And say it
(Oh, Lord, oh)
Let the Lord know, just say it, oh
(Oh, Lord, Lord)
He wants to restore your soul
He said
(Deliver me)
Hey
If my people, who are called by my name
Will move themselves and pray
(Deliver me)
Seek my face, turn from their wicked ways
I will hear from Heaven
Break it on down
So it is
It is so
Amen
Now when we pray
Wanna end that with a declaration, a decree
So I'm speaking for all of you listening
Starting here, starting now
The things that hurt you in the past won't control your future
Starting now, this is a new day
This is your exodus, you are officially released
Now sing it for me Le'Andria
Yeah
(This is my Exodus)
I'm saying goodbye
(This is my Exodus)
To the old me, yeah
(This is my Exodus)
Oh, oh, oh
(Thank you, Lord)
And I'm saying hello
(Thank you, Lord)
To the brand new me, yeah
(Thank you, Lord)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is
(This is my Exodus)
I declare it
(This is my Exodus)
And I decree
(This is my Exodus)
Oh this is, this day, this day is why I thank you, Lord
(This is my Exodus)
(Thank you, Lord)
Around
(Thank you, Lord)
For you and for me
(Thank you, Lord)
Yeah-hey-hey-yeah
Now, Lord God
(This is my Exodus)
Now, Lord God
(This is my Exodus)
It is my
(This is my Exodus)
The things that sent to break me down
(This is my Exodus)
Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey, hey-hey-hey, hey-yeah
(Thank you, Lord)
(Thank you, Lord)
Every weapon
(Thank you, Lord)
God is you and to me, there for me
