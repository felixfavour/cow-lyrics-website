Look in my eyes and you will see
The way that real love used to be
When the flowers bloomed in the springtime
And happiness was all mine
It's hard to let my feelings show
But I've got to let somebody know
About the love that Jesus has given me
He loosed my shackles and He set me free
Is this a dream or is this reality
Have I finally found someone who loves me
I just want to know if
Have you ever loved somebody
Will you ever love somebody
The way that Jesus loves you (la, la, la.....)
Have you ever loved somebody
Will you ever love somebody
The way that Jesus loves you (la, la, la.....)
Over and over I ask myself
Will there ever be anyone else
Who can give me so much joy and peace
And make every day, oh so sweet
