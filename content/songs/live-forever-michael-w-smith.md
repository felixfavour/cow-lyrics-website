You painted me a picture of tomorrow
A place where you and I walked hand in hand
A world without despair and without shadows
But things just didn't turn out how we'd planned
Now you're gone
And I believe that there is somewhere
Where the angels fill the sky
And I believe we'll live forever
You and I
You and I will never die
I wonder if you knew that you were leaving
I thought that I saw something in your eyes
You painted me a picture of believing
I'll see you there on the other side
And I'll be there
And I believe that there is somewhere
Where the angels fill the sky
And I believe we'll live forever
You and I
You and I will never die
