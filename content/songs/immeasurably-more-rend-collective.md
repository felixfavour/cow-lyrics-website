More than all we ask
Than all we seek
All our hopes and dreams
You are immeasurably more
Than we can know
Than we can pray
All our words can say
You are immeasurably more
There's nothing greater than Your love
You're more than we can imagine
There's nothing sweeter on this earth
You're more than we can imagine
Our hearts respond to who You are
It's You, oh Lord, that we adore
[Post-Chorus]
You are more, You are more
You're more than we can imagine
You are more, You are more
You're more than we can imagine
More than all our sin
Than all our shame
Stronger than the grave
You are immeasurably more
I can't help but sing
Can't help but praise
My heart can not contain
You are immeasurably more
